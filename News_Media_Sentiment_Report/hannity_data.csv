2,PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA," I have enjoyed working with all of you. That does not, of course, mean that I've enjoyed every story that you have filed, but that's the point of this relationship. You're not supposed to be sycophants, you're supposed to be skeptics. You're supposed to ask me tough questions. But as I said before, I'm still a citizen. And I think it is important for Democrats or progressives who feel that they came out on the wrong side of this election to be able to distinguish between the normal back and forth, ebb and flow of policy. There's a difference between the normal functioning of politics and certain issues or certain moments where I think our core values may be at stake.",1,676.0,122.0,guest,2.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-18

41,HANNITY," Now, President Obama savagely attacked President-elect Donald Trump because he knew if a Republican won, his legacy would be nonexistent!  And President Obama refused to compromise even a little bit on his leftist ideology. He refused to work with the Republicans in Congress, and instead he relied mostly on executive orders and actions and discretion to unilaterally dictate federal law. And now that Donald Trump won, President Obama is realizing his legacy could all be gone by the stroke of a pen as soon as Donald Trump takes office. Now, take a look at the major Obama executive branch policies that Trump can overturn. For example, on immigration, Trump can easily undo Obama's deferred action for childhood arrivals executive order, which basically granted amnesty to over one million illegal immigrant, quote, ""Dreamers.""   Now, Trump can put an end to catch and release, that policy that lets criminal illegal aliens roam free in our country, or sanctuary cities.  Now, President Trump can push back on states and cities that refuse to cooperate and enforce federal law. On refugees, President Trump can stop thousands of people from countries with ties to terror from ever entering the country. The Iranian nuclear deal? Remember, he didn't go to the Senate. The Trump administration can take steps to get out of that agreement with the number one state sponsor of terrorism. And climate change regulations like the EPA's Clean Power Plan and the Paris climate agreement can easily go bye-bye. Well, then you go over to Congress and then you throw in repealing, replacing ObamaCare and getting rid of Dodd-Frank and financial regulations. Now, think about this. After that, the only thing that is going to be left is President Obama's real legacy, which we've pointed out many times is an utter failure, on the economy, on foreign policy. And unfortunately, this part will be much harder for President-elect Trump to get rid of. Now, the other part of Obama's real failed legacy is that he refused to change. He was so stubborn! He never came close to having a Sister Souljah moment like Bill Clinton did. Remember when he said the era of big government is over, the end of welfare as we know it?

50,HANNITY," Bill Clinton adjusted, was pragmatic. He ended up working with Newt Gingrich. They balanced the budget. This president has never adjusted to reality. President Obama, he has been stuck in his predisposed leftist indoctrinated ideology, this indoctrination by communist Frank Marshall Davis. Mr. President, he never broke away from Saul Alinsky and the rule for radical tactics. He never got away from the Reverend Jeremiah Wright and the church of G-D America. He never separated himself from the unrepentant domestic terrorists Bill Ayers, Bernadine Dohrn. So in the end, President Obama, you accomplished pretty much nothing. And after 100 days of Donald Trump being president, it's going to be like you were never there, except for the debt you left us, doubling the debt, and of course, the judges the liberal activist judges you appointed. So let me offer President Obama, who's outgoing now, some advice. Show a little bit of class. And try and be quiet for once! You had your chance.  Learn from George W. Bush. Sadly, you didn't get the job done. That's your legacy. Here now with reaction, from the Trump organization, Michael Cohen, former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer. Ari, I really tried to get President Bush to go after Barack Obama. I tried hard. He wouldn't do it. I don't expect this will be the same example that Barack Obama will follow.

51,"ARI FLEISCHER, FMR. WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY"," Not even close. You know, let me give you a little insight on that. I've talked to former president Bush about this a lot myself. I remember when President Bush was in Japan, and in Japan, they have a system where the former prime ministers mostly go into the parliament. And Bush was talking to me about it and he said, How on earth can you be president when all your predecessors are in the parliament speaking out against you? He was already thinking about that when he was a sitting president. And it is good for the country. The job is a hard job and the graciousness that a former president extends to their successor and his successors -- successor makes us a strong country. Congress's job is to fight with the president. Former presidents jobs are to fade into the sunset and do so gracefully. Their day has come. They had their chance.

Way more than that are going to show up. When it comes to the work space of the White House, Sean, if I were Donald Trump, I would think about it this way. He's got the upper hand over the press right now because the press is so unpopular. And as Gallup has shown, their poll shows popularity of the press has never been so low because the public doesn't think they're accurate or they report the news accurately or fairly. If Donald Trump physically removes them from the West Wing cubicles, the little office space they occupy, he will turn them into David instead of Goliath. He will flip the leverage that he has over the press corps right now.

You should serve the time that has been sentenced to you. There's the other issue, which is what damage does it do to America? What does it do to our friends, our allies? What is the cost?

You could say this is the first nonpolitical president we've had in a long time, the first businessman of his nature to be president. It's historic in its own way. It was a surprise victory to a lot of people. It caught the pundit class by storm and by surprise. And so there's so much to be celebrated by this -- about this inauguration.  And yet the press is spending all this time focusing on the march for women or the protesters who are banging the garbage cans outside of the Trump international hotel.

But you've heard hints of this with Paul Ryan, even though I think he does want to work with the president on a number of points. There are interesting things going on with the budget reconciliation. I know it sounds boring to people, but what president-elect Trump and his team can do on the edges of budget reconciliation, they could miss a big opportunity if they don't play that right. Paul Ryan understands what you can do with the reconciliation process. And I hope the Trump team understands just how much they can accomplish just by using that mechanism.

On the issue of bringing jobs back to the United States, even on some of the questions of punishing other countries who are blatantly cheating on trade agreement, he has a people on a side on that.  So he should stand firm and do it with a smile and sell this economic populism coast to coast as he did in the campaign. If he stays in that campaign mode while he is governing, you have to keep selling it. You can't lose the confidence of the people on these issues.

But for most of the country, they didn't.  And when it started with the escalator ride in June of 2016, through all of the debates, through the general election, even to election night when exit polls said that Hillary Clinton was going to win, this has been quite something.

The day before, January 19th, this is in 1953, he goes to church with Mamie, and he is trying to figure out how he can calm everybody down, because, believe it or not, they thought a general as president, there was a lot of fear, like what is this guy going to do? And he is in church in the pew, and he starts scribbling, and he scribbles out a prayer. And he decides that is how he is starting his inauguration speech. So he gets to the podium after being sworn in and he tells everybody to bow their head and starts with a prayer. That was very Eisenhower.

They always vote for the Democrats and they always follow those policies, but they are realizing that America wants to see change. They are tired of being promised things that's not being delivered. In L.A. for instance, on skid row we have little children going to sleep without food without clothing.  Why not protest poverty?

In just 14 hours, Donald J. Trump -- he will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States of America. And on the eve of Mr. Trump's inauguration, it's been a very busy day for the incoming president and the soon to be first family. Now, their plane touched down at Joint Base Andrews shortly after 12:00 PM Eastern. And they're all here, Mr. Trump's youngest son, Barron, Donald, Jr., his wife, Vanessa, and their children, Eric Trump, his wife, Lara (ph), Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, along with their children, as well as Mr. Trump's youngest daughter, Tiffany.

10,HANNITY," Now, the celebrations are clearly under way, but tonight, I want to take a moment to focus on something that's very important. Our soon-to- be president has a tremendous opportunity to bring about profound and lasting change to this country. And that is tonight's ""Opening Monologue."" Now, President-elect Trump, well, he stunned the world with his big win back in November. Now, he did it by speaking directly to you, the American people, and by laying out a very specific agenda to fix the problem we all face. Now, starting tomorrow, President-elect Trump, he will be inheriting a very big mess, and it falls on him to help clean this up. Now, I've made a point of showing you all the statistics way over a year about Obama's failed legacy. We're not going to list them all tonight, but we will put them up on the side of the screen so you remember why we do it. I think it's important to remember that these are more than numbers, what you're looking at there. These are real people. These are your family members. These are your friends, your colleagues, your neighbors. Real Americans, real suffering. They are the forgotten men and women who Donald Trump spoke about and spoke directly to and promised to help. Now, during the campaign, President-elect Trump, he put out a list of promises, he called it his contract for the American voter. And in it, there were very specific promises for his first 100 days. For example, lowering taxes and tax reform, free and fair trade deals to protect American workers and their jobs, fixing our nation's infrastructure and sending education back to the states and school choice, repealing, replacing ObamaCare, affordable child care, ending illegal immigration, including building a border wall, keeping communities safe, rebuilding our nation's military and doing what he called draining the swamp. Now, President-elect Trump, if he can keep those promises, this country will be in a much better place one year from now, two years from now, four years from now. So on the eve of this inauguration, my advice for the incoming president is very simple: Don't let the Washington establishment, Republican establishment, Democratic establishment, media establishment, get in the way of accomplishing what is a bold agenda. Remember, the Bible does tell us where there is no vision, no insight, the people perish. And right now, at this moment in history, America desperately needs a revitalization, and Donald Trump, this is your opportunity. You can be the person to do this. So I say to the President-elect Donald Trump: Congratulations, and the country wishes you the best. Here now with reaction, former secretary of education, former drug czar, FOX News contributor Bill Bennett. Maybe it's -- maybe I'm keeping it too simple, but if he fulfills that agenda on energy, vetting, the wall, tax cuts, seven brackets to three -- if all of these things, I think the country's infinitely better off. We'll see the benefits within two years maximum. Thoughts.",1,3002.0,505.0,host,6.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-19

They were at holy sites today in our civic religion, we call it that, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Lincoln Memorial. Look, this guy comes to Washington as a certain kind of man. Liberals don't understand him. The media doesn't understand him. A lot of American people do understand him. I see in him a lot of what I saw in Ronald Reagan.

And I think Donald Trump will be the same because I think there's a kind of irrefutable, rebuttable core to the man that's not going to change. So I'll take a handful of the things you mentioned, and I'll be very pleased. Let me just say -- and I don't say this in bitterness. I just say this -- this is part of why I'm so pleased. The last act that Barack Obama performed in office, he performed today. He commuted the sentences of 330 major drug dealers.

None of these other Republicans would really embraced that. They looked down upon those. They called them restrictionist, isolationist, protectionist.  The Bushes called them all that.

2,PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP," When Justice Scalia passed away suddenly last February, I made a promise to the American people. If I were elected president, I would find the very best judge in the country for the Supreme Court. This may be the most transparent judicial selection process in history.  Months ago, as a candidate, I publicly presented a list of brilliant and accomplished people to the American electorate, and pledged to make my choice from among that list. I am a man of my word. I will do as I say, something that the American people have been asking for from Washington for a very, very long time. Today, I am keeping another promise to the American people by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch.",1,679.0,121.0,guest,2.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31

4,HANNITY," I am a man of my word and I am now fulfilling another promise that I made to the American people. That was President Trump saying repeatedly he would select an originalist, a constitutionalist to serve on the Supreme Court, and that is exactly what he did earlier tonight. Now, over the course of the campaign, I did ask then candidate now President Trump several times why it was important to him to put forward a justice who will strictly adhere to the original meaning of the words of the Constitution.

23,HANNITY," President Trump, as you just saw, was adamant about nominating a justice who believes in coequal branches of government, separation of powers, not somebody who will legislate from the bench, who will read and interpret the U.S. Constitution the way our Founding Fathers and framers intended. It's why, as he said tonight, President Trump put out a list during the campaign of 21 people that he would choose from to nominate to the U.S. Supreme Court. Not surprisingly, Judge Gorsuch was on that original list, and for good reason. He has a very strong resume. Judge Gorsuch -- he is now only 49 years old. He clerked for several prominent judges, including Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. In 2006, he was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, where he currently serves, and was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in a unanimous voice vote. He's described as an originalist, a textualist. Now, Judge Gorsuch is also known for being a strong defender of religious liberty. Key rulings include siding with Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters of the Poor in this case against the Obama administration's contraception mandate. And Judge Gorsuch has made his judicial philosophy very clear. Now, take a look about what he said on originalism during a lecture about Justice Antonin Scalia just last year.",1,1334.0,225.0,host,20.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31

25,JUDGE NEIL GORSUCH," It seems to me that an assiduous focus on text, structure and history is essential to being a good judge. That, yes, judges should be in the business of declaring what the law is using the traditional tools of interpretation, rather than pronouncing the law as they might wish it to be in light of their own views, always with an eye on the outcome, engaged, perhaps, in some Benthamite calculation of pleasures and pains along the way.",1,437.0,79.0,guest,21.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31

27,HANNITY," Joining us now with reaction, Leonard Leo. He's one of the people that advised President Trump on this decision. And he was in the East Room tonight for the big announcement. Sir, welcome to the program.  Glad to have you.",1,223.0,41.0,host,22.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
28,"LEONARD LEO, ADVISER TO PRESIDENT TRUMP ON SUPREME COURT", Thank you.  Great to be here.,1,30.0,7.0,guest,23.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
29,HANNITY," You and a lot of prominent judicial scholars were asked to look for certain candidates that fit this meaning of a constitutionalist, an originalist. Maybe some Americans tonight are hearing these terms for the first time. Maybe they don't follow the Supreme Court as closely. How would you best define those terms and differentiate originalism from judicial activism?",1,368.0,59.0,host,24.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
30,LEO," Well, first of all, I think the way to think about it is that a judge has a deep sense of fairness and a sense of impartiality when he is grounded in the text and original meaning of the Constitution because what he's doing then is he's putting the text and the original meeting ahead of any political predispositions he may have. And that's the way to judge cases fairly and partially without regard to your own predispositions or prejudices.",1,444.0,81.0,guest,25.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
31,HANNITY," And we would look at somebody who is a judicial activist as somebody a liberal would want to put on the court, somebody that believes that the Constitution is a living and breathing document that they have the right to almost legislate from the bench, not respecting separation of powers, coequal branches, correct?",1,316.0,54.0,host,26.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
32,LEO," That's right, Sean. For an activist, it's all about results. It's all about the policy results that a particular judge might like or a group of people may like. And that's not what judging is all about. If you want to do that, you should run for office. You shouldn't be a judge.",1,280.0,54.0,guest,27.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
33,HANNITY," My two favorite justices in my lifetime were Antonin Scalia, who passed away, and Justice Clarence Thomas. A lot of times conservatives that believe in originalism, like myself, have been disappointed. Justice Souter is one example, and maybe even in the -- in the one case, ObamaCare, Justice Roberts even, the chief justice. Can you assure conservatives tonight that this justice is like Scalia, like Thomas, and that you wouldn't expect many surprises?",1,456.0,74.0,host,28.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
34,HANNITY," What I see in Judge Gorsuch is a very important quality that gets you there. And that's courage. It's courage and its independence. It's the willingness to stick to your guns, to make decisions that have to be made that sometimes you might not agree with. And that's what he has. If you look at his opinions, he has never hesitated to dissent or write a separate opinion when the meaning of the Constitution or the text of the Constitution needed to be elaborated and the majority of the court didn't do that. I think we are seeing in him very much an extension of Justice Scalia's legacy.",1,590.0,109.0,host,29.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
35,HANNITY," It's interesting. I actually tweeted out a picture tonight. I got a picture of Antonin Scalia and now the nominee Judge Gorsuch together.  He seems to almost be -- I don't know if this is the right word, he seemed very enamored and inspired by Justice Scalia and maybe Justice Thomas? Is that a fair statement?",1,311.0,57.0,host,30.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
36,LEO, Judge Gorsuch considers Justice Scalia a mentor. And that is significant. A lot of judges in Judge Gorsuch's age range who studied in law school around that time view Justice Scalia as a line (ph) in the law and a true mentor because of the path-breaking work he did in bringing originalism and textualism back to the Supreme Court's jurisprudence in a significant way.,1,370.0,65.0,guest,31.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
37,HANNITY," I think one of the brightest justices we've ever had in modern times, and one of the funniest certainly was Antonin Scalia. His opinions were scathing. His dissents were even more scathing. I guess want to ask you this question about Mr. Gorsuch because I think this is really important. Walk us through the process. Then candidate Trump went to the Federalist Society, went to people that study the justices that are on the lower courts. Like in his case, he's on the 10th circuit court of appeals. What was it about this judge and this process that inspired you about what the president, then candidate Trump was doing?",1,622.0,110.0,host,32.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
38,LEO," Well, again, the two most important things you can have are, one, a demonstrable record showing a commitment to the Constitution as it's written. So you want to have lots of opinions that show you know what you're doing and you know how to do originalism and textualism, and Judge Gorsuch has that. And then secondly, you want to see signs of courage. You want to see signs of someone who has a strong will, who's going to stick to his guns. And again, Judge Gorsuch's life's work, his judicial opinions, demonstrate that. So that's I think two of the reasons why he emerged as a very serious contender to succeed Justice Scalia, who is really in many ways irreplaceable.",1,672.0,121.0,guest,33.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
39,HANNITY," The liberal talking points were written long before tonight's decision. Whoever the president chose was going to be described as out of the mainstream, somebody that's an extremist. What is your response to those people making those claims based on the record and the cases that we've seen and the writings that he's been involved in?",1,335.0,57.0,host,34.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
40,LEO," Well, it's not surprising. Liberals have always had to rely on the Supreme Court for the policy results they want because the political process isn't going to take the kinds of extreme positions that they desire to have enacted. So they look to the courts for that, and when they see a nominee who is fair, impartial, is going to interpret the law as it's written and that that's not necessarily going to end up with the policy results they want, they're going to oppose him. And that's what's happening here.",1,510.0,92.0,guest,35.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
41,HANNITY," I think -- and we'll get more deeply into this as the show goes on tonight. One other question on the process. Back in May, then candidate Trump -- who did he approach? Who did you speak to?",1,191.0,39.0,host,36.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31

Clearly, a precedent has been set with Harry Reid for lower court justices. What are your thoughts?",1,281.0,49.0,host,41.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
48,LEO," Well, I'm not sure we're headed in that direction. We just learned before the show tonight, Sean, that there are seven Democrats who already said they won't filibuster and will support a vote. So this is becoming a very different process than we thought. I think part of that is the president's resolve in the nomination that he made. I think part of it is just this extraordinary nominee that we have in Judge Gorsuch, who I think is really very hard to lay a glove on.",1,471.0,88.0,guest,42.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
49,HANNITY," You know, Mr. Leo, I will say that I hope that is, in fact, the case. I think it may have a lot to do with politics. I would bet those are states the Democrats are serving in that Donald Trump probably won, just a political thought on my part. But more importantly, after what Democrats did to good people like Robert Bork, good people like Clarence Thomas and the process that they put them through -- and the smearing and the slander and besmirchment, it was so unbecoming of that body. That's good news. Leonard Leo, thank you for being with us.",1,549.0,104.0,host,43.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31

This is a guy with a sterling reputation, but beyond that, he's got a decade track record.  We've looked at every case he's decided, looked at every opinion he's joined. And frankly, they're going to have a lot of trouble mounting a case against him, but I don't think we should assume they're not going to. I'm going to operate, as I do in every case -- I assume I'm at four justices and I've got to get the fifth. I was never a great math student, but I could count to five. Here, I'm going to -- we're going to believe we're going to get there. We're going to get there.

But what I'm so impressed with in terms of Judge Gorsuch is not only the fact that he has incredible credentials, but he has the judicial temperament. But I liked one of the things that he said in that clip that you did. (INAUDIBLE) a judge who likes every outcome or decision he reaches is probably a bad judge. And that speaks to the fact that he is very much a textualist and a constitutionalist. That means that his decisions are decided not so much by policy or by what he thinks, but by the law, by precedent, by the Constitution. And you can't always agree with everything you do because it is based upon the law! And this is a man who clearly understands the solemnity of the position that he's being offered and/or nominated for, and he writes in the style of Justice Scalia.

It honored Maureen Scalia, which I thought was very important. And the entire solemnity of the event speaks well of the way in which the president and his cabinet and his team views Supreme Court nominations and the importance of that.

98,HANNITY," Let me go to -- let me go to, for example, some of the cases that went before him -- Hobby Lobby, Little Sisters of the Poor. Some of these decisions controversial, but what you glean from his judicial philosophy based on those decisions?",1,239.0,45.0,host,85.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
99,INGRAHAM," Yes, Leonard touched on this earlier, Sean, but he's a textualist, which means he doesn't believe that judges should read meaning into statutes or the Constitution that didn't exist at the time it was written. He doesn't believe in reading legislative history, taking into account other contemporaneous documents or other notes written by legislators. He believes that the intent of what Congress passed in statutes and what our framers wrote in our Constitution is what should govern. That's textualism. That's what Justice Scalia believed in, and that's clearly what Neil Gorsuch has guided his judicial life on. And that's very reassuring for those of us who believe that the judiciary, especially in really the last half century, has been much more activist -- in other words, acting like a super-legislature of unelected judges who have life tenure and who are not accountable to the voters. So Judge Gorsuch is a refreshing change from a long history of judicial activism coming from the left, appointed by mostly Democrats but not all Democrats. Republicans have had a lot of swings and misses in these judicial appointments. And conservatives across the country certainly hope that Judge Gorsuch is not going to be the disappointment that, let's say, a David Hackett (ph) Souter was, or in some cases, of course, the man for whom Neil Gorsuch clerked, Anthony M. Kennedy.",1,1380.0,227.0,guest,86.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
100,HANNITY," And Judge Jeanine, let me ask you -- what you take out of Hobby Lobby, that particular case, Little Sisters of the Poor, and his decisions there?",1,146.0,28.0,host,87.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
101,PIRRO, What I take out of that is the fact that he holds religious liberty extremely important.,1,89.0,17.0,guest,88.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31

103,PIRRO," And the criticism that we're now hearing, that the left has conjured up, is that he's anti-woman and pro-corporation. They take from Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters of the Poor the fact that because Gorsuch said that the right of the corporate -- of Hobby Lobby to say, Look -- and Little Sisters of the Poor to say, Look, we don't want to be forced to give something or do (ph) provide abortifacts (sic), something against our religion, to women who work in the -- for Little Sisters of the Poor, it's against our religion.

112,INGRAHAM," Sean, if you don't have -- if you don't have religious conscience rights, if there's no religious liberty that accrues to a group of people, whether in a closely held, you know, business organization or with a group that's purely religious as a group of nuns who take care of the indigent elderly, then what does religious liberty mean? Like, what did our framers actually intend when they wrote the 1st Amendment to the Constitution? That -- that case and his disposition of that case reveals a lot about his judicial philosophy. And that should be very reassuring to people who believe in the original meaning and a more textual interpretation of the Constitution, which again empowers the original meaning of the Constitution. And when he does statutory interpretation, he doesn't substitute his own judgment for the judgment of duly elected representatives.",1,862.0,143.0,guest,97.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31

115,SEKULOW, Yes.,1,5.0,2.0,guest,99.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
116,HANNITY," It's very interesting because if it really is a religious liberty case, as Laura points out, a 1st Amendment case, if the government -- think of it the other way. If the government is allowed to mandate that the Little Sisters of the Poor or a corporation must do things that contradict their deeply held religious values and convictions, that is particularly chilling and frightening, and it should be for anybody, whether you're liberal, libertarian, conservative. It shouldn't matter. Right?",1,495.0,81.0,host,100.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
117,SEKULOW," You're absolutely correct. Look, I've had the privilege of litigating for three decades in front of the Supreme Court of the United States on religious liberty. Let me say this. Judge Gorsuch -- and Laura's absolutely right, but in his concurring opinion in the Hobby Lobby case, he pointed out -- he went at length to point out that the Green (ph) family had constitutional rights that could impact their business. In other words, you didn't have to separate your faith from your business, especially when it was a closely held corporation, as Hobby Lobby is. So this fundamental recognition of the right to religious liberty both on an individual basis, but in your daily life and in your business, is -- should be comforting to everyone. Now, look, there's those on the left that don't like the Hobby Lobby decision, but the fact of the matter, if you look at the text of the Constitution, if you understand what's called the religion clauses, the majority opinion there was correct. And Judge Gorsuch especially was correct in his concurring opinion. And let me say something else about that concurring opinion. He went out of his way to point out exactly what his view of religious liberty was in that case. He didn't simply join a majority opinion. He put in writing what exactly his thought was.",1,1303.0,227.0,guest,101.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
118,PIRRO, And the fact that the president selected him as his nominee in a case that is so important in terms of contemporary issues that involve religious liberty tell us where Donald Trump is on this particular issue and how important it is to him.,1,241.0,45.0,guest,102.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
119,HANNITY," He also weighed in on the Second Amendment.

122,INGRAHAM," Yes, he was referring to the Heller case and -- and -- and that's -- that was a layup, in my view, of a decision. But again, the thing he's going to get smashed on by the Democrats is the right to die, the euthanasia book, which informs us of his view on -- on -- on life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. Like, what -- you can't deprive another person of life, even if it's at the end of their life, or pre-born children. I mean, that goes to the heart of what the Constitution really is all about.",1,502.0,101.0,guest,105.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31

It's the freedom to exercise, free exercise of religious belief and understanding.

I was getting worried earlier today, and I know you were as well, that it was going to be Mr. Gorsuch. What is your take and what is the take from people there?",2,418.0,77.0,host,141.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31
170,"SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS HOST"," It's interesting because my inbox flooded immediately with people supporting and opposing him. Many on the left are worried about, as you had a lengthy discussion there about the Hobby Lobby decision, all of the prochoice groups tell me they think that signals to them that he is going to be anti-choice, anti-woman, and you know the smears are already starting. You can see what their strategy is going to be with respect to him. And I think it was Laura who pointed out this. A 2009 book that he wrote about euthanasia, assisted suicide, so we know where his positions are.  He's talked a lot about the respect for life in all of its forms and all of its times. We know those things will come up. But listen, this is a guy who way back in Columbia before it was probably cool in the '80s, he started a paper. He cofounded one called ""The Fed.""  And it was a pushback against what he thought was the dominant liberal philosophy and culture on campus. So he is not new to this. His mom was the first female head of the EPA under President Reagan. He is very familiar with how it works here in Washington. And you know he's even written about how confirmation battles in his opinion have become political warfare. He had a piece out in 2005 in ""The National Review"" where he talked about the attacks that happened to people who step up and are nominated for these positions on the federal bench. So he knows what he's walking into. He has also criticized the left and says they have come to rely on courtrooms and judges to get their agenda done where they haven't been able to do with voters and at the ballot box. So he said a lot of things the left is just simply not going to like even though he's got that Columbia, Harvard, Oxford pedigree and a ton of support. The ABA, which is not known to be a conservative organization, has unanimously rated him as well qualified. So there is no doubt the president factored in his ability to be confirmed.",2,1951.0,363.0,guest,142.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31

172,BREAM," I have not confirmed those numbers. But we've heard thinking that way, because, as we know, there are so many of these Democrats who are up in critical red states in 2018 and that really may influence the way they look at this. And so many of them are going to, listen, this guy is eminently qualified on paper, looking at his record. Whether we agree with him or not, he's not somebody who can say is not qualified. There's going to be a lot of pressure on them to at least let him get to a vote. So we will see, but I think the numbers could be there.",2,554.0,111.0,guest,144.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-01-31

And let me be clear here, this is important. President Obama, Hillary Clinton, Senate House Democratic leaders, if you continue to coddle this outrage, this behavior from your side of the aisle, then the repercussions of the violence and the anarchy, it will be on your hands! You're responsible. You're supposed to be leaders. Joining us now, the host of the show ""Malkin Investigates"" on CRTV.com, Michelle Malkin. I don't think it's going to end. I would say with every item on Trump's agenda, what he promised the American people, if it's energy, if it's borders, if it's vetting, if it's a judge, if it's lower taxes, there's going to be the same reaction.

22,"MICHELLE MALKIN, CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST"," I think you're right, Sean. And I think the montage that you showed of how this dates back decades and decades emphasizes that there's nothing new about this anarchy and that obstructionism is the middle name of the democrat party. And the middle name of the far left is by any means necessary. That has been their operational motto for three or four decades now. What happened at Berkeley has happened many, many times before. It's just more inflamed than it ever has been. I spoke in Berkeley at an event I was invited by the College Republicans in 2004. And my lecture hall had to be chained shut because there were hundreds and hundreds, throngs of students who, of course, were encouraged by faculty members to try and shut me down! This is what the left does. And Clarence Thomas said it more powerfully than anyone has in modern life about the uppity blacks and browns and yellows and reds who have been suppressed by the left because their ideas their expressions are so dangerous that you've got these leftists on campuses from Berkeley to the East Coast to everywhere in between threatening conservative speakers.

I have to tell you, right -- right after the inaugural ceremonies, right after the parade was over, I walked with the president and other members of our team into the Oval Office.

But look, if you compare to prior administrations, the pace at which Democrats and the Senate are forcing this process I think is a real disservice to the country. And we're going to continue to drive forward. We're going to get the president's cabinet approved, and we're going to get that nominee to the Supreme Court approved. The American people want to see this country moving forward. They want to see this new president have the cabinet around him and have the appointments that he's determined and been elected to make approved by the Senate. They have a role to play, but that's not about obstruction. It's about advice and consent as appropriate. We respect that process, but we're -- we're -- we continue to drive this effort in every way possible because President Trump deserves his cabinet, and he deserves it in the near term.  And the American people deserve a new justice on the Supreme Court of the caliber of Neil Gorsuch.",2,988.0,174.0,guest,32.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-02
48,HANNITY," One of the big issues that has created a lot of controversies, the executive action on extreme vetting in seven particular countries.  It's been misreported as a Muslim ban. Chuck Schumer's said it was mean- spirited and un-American. Now, there are some 40 other Muslim-majority nations that are not impacted. As a matter of fact 90 percent of Muslims worldwide are not impacted by that. Yet the news media continues to say it's a Muslim ban. Is that fake news to you?",2,469.0,83.0,host,33.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-02
49,PENCE," It really is. And any fair-minded person looking at the president's action knows that what President Trump has done is essentially imposes a pause on countries that have been compromised by terrorism, so that we can evaluate the screening process and establish an extreme vetting so that people coming into this country don't represent a threat to our families and to our communities. It's an indefinite pause with regard to Syria, but with regard to the other countries, we're going to be calling on the Department of Homeland Security, all of our team to work together to evaluate how we can continue to go forward with immigration from those countries but not compromise the safety and security of the American people. But it -- clearly, it's not -- it's not a Muslim ban. It's not in any way associated with religion. This -- the president made it clear in this executive order that we are not going to compromise the safety and security of the American people with regard to these seven countries that the Obama administration identified as compromised by terror, that the Congress has identified. We're take a pause. We're going to step back and we're going to put safety and security of the American people first.",2,1221.0,210.0,guest,34.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-02

And with regard to other countries, Saudi Arabia being among them, we -- we have confidence that they have the kind of safeguards, the kind of law enforcement, the kind of screening in their country that when a person presents a visa or attempts to come into the United States, that we know they are who they present as. These other countries -- again, the Obama administration and the Congress have identified these seven countries as having systems that have been compromised through strife, through the advent of terrorism, in the case of Syria through civil war, so that we need to step back to make sure that we have the additional safeguards. And I got to tell you, President Trump has a lot of priorities, but his number one priority is the safety and security of the American people.

55,PENCE," I think it's exactly that choice. And at the end of the day, you know, on the very date the executive order was implemented, within the next 24 hours, there were hundreds of thousands of people that came in from countries all over the world into the United States. And I think more than 100 were detained for additional questioning. That is a small price to pay for the security of the American people. I mean, look, we live in very dangerous times. There are people all across the world who are engaged in unthinkable violence. The president spoke again about that this week at the National Prayer Breakfast. And I think what people welcome in this administration and they welcome in our new president is a clear-eyed look at the world, a recognition of the threat of radical Islamic terrorism to the United States and that we've just got to do things differently to make sure that our families and our communities and our nation is save.",2,940.0,169.0,guest,40.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-02

And in many respects, the last eight years, the United States abdicated leadership on the world stage in one region after another and one relationship after another. And what President Trump has been about, engaging with these world leaders, is opening the door to conversations, to look for ways that we can work together with the focus on the American people first and America's interests first.

I know Americans, especially after Barack Obama accumulated more debt than all other presidents before him combined are worried about the debt, pay as you go, where does the money come from, how do you think Congress is going to work with this president?

All these debates over spending and tackling the national debt, meeting the needs of infrastructure at home, rebuilding our military, the president is committed to.

107,HANNITY," That was President Trump keeping yet another promise to you, the American people, by nominating judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court. Now, Donald Trump is keeping his word, and as a result, lawmakers and bureaucrats in Washington are now feeling the heat. A new article by the A.P. sums this up pretty well. It reads, quote, ""Amid Trump's shakeup, many wondering what is coming next."" Joining us now with reaction, FOX News contributor Laura Ingraham.  Considering he is starting on the wall and he's starting on Obamacare, he has gone forward with the regulation, ethics reform, vetting refugees, and an originalist, I would say the rest of the list is probably what's coming next, right?",4,698.0,118.0,host,75.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-02
108,"LAURA INGRAHAM, EDITOR IN CHIEF, LIFEZETTE.COM"," I think people are so stunned that a politician acts in a very un-politician-like manner. And he is a politician out. He surprised everyone in the election. And he is doing what he campaigned up. And for the most part, I think his proposals and his ideas are fairly popular. I know there is this or that pole of disapproval rating. But we know on his immigration pause, the refugee pause, it is actually quite popular. It seems very common sense to most people. So these various media figures and these protesters, they are going to act out and have their temper tantrums because that's what they do. The rest of us have to work. They are going to shout and wail.",4,664.0,123.0,guest,76.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-02

112,HANNITY," How do you have time to protest? I would never protest. I have better things to do. All right, I want to ask you about what I call an information crisis in the country. Before today, Neil Gorsuch, the president's nominee for the Supreme Court, apparently in high school he had started a fascist forever club. Fake news. The MLK bust -- fake news. The Muslim ban, there are 40 plus Muslim majority countries that weren't on the list, fake news by all of them. And it just keeps coming, or that he threatened to invade Mexico when speaking with President Nieto. This is getting worse by the day. Why do you think this is happening?",4,630.0,117.0,host,79.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-02
113,INGRAHAM," I think the mainstream media is very frustrated because they thought they had Trump in this box during the campaign, and they thought, OK, we have done him in this time, or he made a misstep and we are going to be able to capitalize it, or the Democrats are going to trounce him, Hillary is going to win. Then they have all this egg on their face. So I think for a lot of media types on the left, they feel like now they have to prove themselves all over again. So they have to demonstrate whether it is through misreporting or improper emphasis or sometimes just downright making up facts, they have to show the country that they were right. So I think it is a wish fulfillment on their part, sloppy reporting, and just a lack of professionalism. And he is a different cat. Trump is not like all these other people they've dealt with who are cowed and suck their thumbs and sit on the floor and cry when the media or someone on the left goes after them. He goes after them right back. And that is very uncomfortable for them. They don't know how to deal with it.",4,1064.0,205.0,guest,80.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-02
114,HANNITY," So he is getting rid of 75 percent plus of regulations in the country, started the process of replacing and replacing Obamacare in his executive order to ease the burden of Obamacare on people. Then he took action to freeze new and pending regulations he said. Then he withdrew the U.S. from TPP. Then he instituted a government hiring freeze. Then he banned money from going to abortions or countries that pay for abortions.  Then he went for Keystone, then he went for Dakota, then he issued his executive actions on constructing the wall, extreme vetting, rebuilding the military, a plan to defeat ISIS, instituted a five year lobbying ban to get rid of the swamp, drain the swamp, and then Neil Gorsuch. I don't know anybody in the history of my lifetime in politics that has actually checked off their list every day and probably is wondering why he can't finish it in three more weeks.",4,892.0,158.0,host,81.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-02
115,INGRAHAM," I know. He is just like OK, let's get this done. What else can we do next? I think, again, he is not as deliberative, some of the critics are saying in how things are rolled out. And maybe there is something to maybe some of what would happen on the pause on the refugees, but for the most part, I think this is fairly routine stuff. But you are right to point out, he has hit the holy grail of left-wing politics. He hit the abortion issue. He hit the environmental issue. He hit the regulatory state. Of course he had the refugee issue. The Islamophobia charges flying. So he has hit all these hot button issues but they are actually really important issues of the country. And the left, there is so much incoming, I think they are going a little crazy on the other side. I think they are getting a little nutty on the other side.  They can't handle it.",4,856.0,165.0,guest,82.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-02
116,HANNITY," A little nutty? Now they are burning in Berkeley, the home of freedom of speech, or where the freedom of speech movement on campuses began. All right, Trump urges McConnell to go nuclear if it comes to that. I agree with Donald Trump. I'm wondering about Mitch McConnell, and in fairness to him, he did hold off on the president's nominee in the final year of his term, which is known as the Biden rule that Chuck Schumer supported.",4,433.0,80.0,host,83.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-02

118,HANNITY, But that's the Biden rule.,4,27.0,6.0,host,85.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-02
119,INGRAHAM," The last 70 years of Supreme Court justice has not been confirmed in the final year of a president's term. That wasn't really out of the ordinary, but it doesn't matter. They wanted that seat. Now they are calling it a stolen seat. So they are going to keep branding actions by Donald Trump as misogynist, racist, sexist. He's is operating like a dictator, autocrat. Again, there's very little substance coming from the Democrats. It is just a personal attack or pejorative, unfair hits. There is no substance. And I think they need to win those middle-class voters, Sean. They need to win the old rust belt back. They have to win those voters. I don't see that this kind of stuff combined with the Berkeley craziness -- Tim Kaine the other day fight in the streets, fight in the courts. I think that stuff doesn't go over well with regular folks.",4,848.0,153.0,guest,86.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-02

He is fulfilling promises which, first of all, if you have done it with two or three issues, it would have shocked most people.  But here we are not even two weeks into his presidency, he is mounting an offensive in which he's fulfilling those promises.

So what I did not see -- and I said this at my press conference the day after the election -- is Donald Trump heard something that no one else heard. He connected with people in this country unlike anybody I'd ever seen before running for president. Remember, I ran for vice president in the last election. And I basically added -- thought about an election the way we thought about it in 2012.  And what he did was mix up the constituency, the vote coalition. He spoke to people who felt like they hadn't been spoken to in years and he gave voice to people who felt like they were voiceless. He tapped into that, and that is something that most people didn't see. And that's something that I said the next day, Bravo. Very impressed.",2,1009.0,193.0,guest,36.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-16

We talk all the time.  We're working on the same plan. What -- what I did during the transition with my counterpart in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is we put together a 200-day plan for the president to get this agenda that we all have agreed on through the system. And we're exactly on track and on our timeline with that agenda.",2,519.0,98.0,guest,38.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-16
56,HANNITY," That's really the biggest part of what I want to discuss today because -- let's go through what Donald Trump has done. He started executive orders, eased the burden of ""Obama care,"" impending actions to freeze, get rid of 75 percent of all regulations. He withdrew from TPP.  He had a federal hiring freeze. He banned money going from (sic) foreign countries for abortion. He signed executive action for Keystone, for the Dakota pipeline. He issued executive orders on the construction of the border wall. He stripped money from sanctuary cities. He's taken action, as we all know, on extreme vetting, and we'll get to that in a minute. He used executive action to rebuild the military. A plan will be on his desk in seven days to defeat ISIS. And he nominated Neil Gorsuch. We saw him meet with the prime ministers of Canada, Great Britain, and yesterday, of course, Bibi Netanyahu. So what I see -- this is the biggest question I'm getting from radio and form television. He's moving at the speed of light, and people have been asking me -- it's the top story on the Drudge Report today. Where's Congress because for eight years, you guys had a plan. You kept saying and promising you'll repeal, replace ObamaCare. And I guess what people want to know is, when are these things going to get done?",2,1299.0,231.0,host,39.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-16

60,HANNITY, Right.,2,7.0,2.0,host,43.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-16
61,RYAN," So the reason we're doing regulatory reform right now is we have a certain window of time where we can go back into the Obama administration and cancel their regulations. It's a law called the Congressional Review Act, and it has a shelf life for just a couple of months. And so we've been consuming February and March as regulatory reform going back into the Obama administration and canceling their regulations. And so first, it's regulatory reform because we have this window of time to cancel bad Obama regulations. Then we're doing ObamaCare. After we're done with ObamaCare, then we're doing our budget. And our budget is what -- the second budget, which will be tax reform. So we're doing two budgets in one year, which has never been done before. This is faster than it's ever been done before.",2,803.0,141.0,guest,44.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-16

63,RYAN," You have to understand there's a legislative process, and we have all of these things we ran on that we said we would do. We're now in the middle of doing those things, and January and February is the regulatory stuff because the clock on the ability to go after Obama regulations ends soon.",2,292.0,55.0,guest,46.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-16
64,HANNITY," All right, here's the big question. The president ran on an agenda. You said he touched or tapped into something that other people missed. We have 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more on poverty, lowest labor participation rate, lowest home ownership rate in 51 years. So here's my question. Donald Trump runs and he says, I'm going to build a wall, repeal and replace ""Obama care."" He says, I'm going to vet refugees.  I'm going to make America energy-independent. We're going to go from seven brackets to three, corporate tax rate 15 percent, allowed repatriation at 10 percent from multi-national corporations. He runs on education back to the states, fixing the VA, building up our military to have a stronger military. This is the question that I think conservatives and Americans -- and I would call this the forgotten man election. They want to know -- and this -- hopefully, you'll answer today because I heard everything from ObamaCare will be done day one, to the spring, to the summer, to the -- by the end of the year.

185,NETANYAHU, I think it was a historical meeting. It was a meeting of the minds and a meeting of the hearts.,4,96.0,21.0,guest,141.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-16
186,HANNITY," Interesting. It was interesting to watch the president say what a cherished ally Israel is, and for you to say there is no better supporter of the Jewish people and the state of Israel than Donald Trump. And you have known him for how long? How do you know that?",4,263.0,51.0,host,142.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-16
187,NETANYAHU," I knew him from the time that I was serving as Israel's ambassador to the U.N., and we would sort of bump into each other here and there in New York city. But we've got to know each other and most recently, obviously. And look, we have always had a great alliance between Israel and America through successive presidencies. I feel we have now, as the president says, an even stronger alliance, a new day, he called it, maybe a new age.",4,436.0,83.0,guest,143.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-16
188,HANNITY," I felt there was a cryptic message being sent, and I want to just actually read what you said here. For the first time in your life, for the first time in the history of your country, you said that the Arab countries, your neighbors in the region, do not see Israel as an enemy but as an ally. And then President Trump talked about newfound -- or you talked about newfound Arab partners. And he talked about maybe one state, maybe two states, but may be a bigger deal, a more important deal. So I'm listening, and this is my take, is that you had once said that one of the benefits of the Iran deal if there's only one benefit is it brought you and your Arab neighbors together. So my read on this is that Israel now has a stronger relationship with United States, maybe a strong relationship with Great Britain, but also Jordan, Egypt, maybe the Emirates, maybe Saudi Arabia, that has never existed before. Is that true?",4,922.0,173.0,host,144.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-16
189,NETANYAHU," I think there is a change. The change is coming because of the rise of radical Islam. Radical Islam has two fountainheads. Once is the radical Sunnis led by ISIS, and before that by Al Qaeda, and the radical Shiites led by Iran. The Arab countries are threatened by both. And when we look around and say, who is going to help us against these twin threats?  They say, well, there's one country in the region that is powerful, that's determined, that's resolved to fight this common enemy, that's Israel. So they don't view us anymore as their enemy, but increasingly they us as their ally against the common threat. And I have to say in my conversation yesterday with President Trump, he sees the things in the same way. That opens up opportunities. No question about it.",4,772.0,139.0,guest,145.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-16
190,HANNITY," Can I get into a little more deeply, what has happened in the interim? You have forged closer alliances. I know you can't divulge everything, but what can you tell us about these particular countries, the Saudi's, the Egyptians, the Jordanians, because I've got to believe none of those countries want Iranian hegemony in the region?",4,334.0,57.0,host,146.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-16

192,HANNITY, They're right.,4,15.0,3.0,host,148.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-16
193,NETANYAHU," And they're right. And look, I had -- in the great alliance between Israel and the United States, we have had our differences. We also had, and I have to give credit to President Obama, we had this memorandum of understanding, 10 years support for Israel. I appreciate that. But we also had our differences, and the most important difference was on Iran. The Arab countries sort of whispered things in the dark. They wouldn't say it outright. I had to sort of speak out for everyone in the region. But right now I think it's not really in the region. People understand that Iran is a malevolent force. And the nuclear deal with Iran, if it is kept, the Iranians just walk in. The deal essentially said this, it said no bomb today, 100 bombs tomorrow, in 10 years. That's what it says. Because Iran can go the enrichment of uranium, which is the key --",4,852.0,158.0,guest,149.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-16

195,NETANYAHU," Yes. Now, the assumption was, OK, we are kicking the can down the road, but this nuclear can, a single bomb becomes the capacity to make dozens and dozens of bombs. And Iran doesn't change its attitude. Since the signing of the deal, Sean, this is what has happened. Iran has become more aggressive, more deadly, sponsoring more terrorism.

They've killed Americans all over the place. They've sponsored terrorism against Americans all over the place. Now they're going to build ICBMs, intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach the United States and have the multiple warheads to do that? That's horrible.

211,HANNITY," That's the important issue. The one thing the president said yesterday is that will not happen. And I am just assuming with a new coalition that would be very possible. I don't think a lot of people fully understand -- I've watched all these years since the Iranian revolution in '79, death to America, death to America, death to Israel, burning the American flag, burning the Israeli flag. I think now after all these incidents of terror -- we have this whole immigration problem where so many refugees have gone to Europe and parts of Europe have culturally shifted dramatically. And if you look at countries under Sharia that the oppress women and they kill gays and lesbians. And there are 16 countries that don't accept Jewish passports, 16. And America is supposed to take in the world's refugee population. Explain, how does America and Europe based on your experience in the region, how do they ascertain that they're taking in immigrants and they're taking in refugees, whether or not ISIS will infiltrate the refugee population? How can you possibly vet what is in somebody's heart?",5,1093.0,187.0,host,162.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-16

Every country has to have the freedom to do so, and I won't get into your considerations in doing so. But I will say -- I will say this. I'm a great believer in human exchanges and markets and so on. But I think it's very important to be able to prevent the infiltration of terrorists, because terrorism is so disruptive. It doesn't necessarily kill that many people, although you suffered a terror attack that killed thousands of people.",5,532.0,99.0,guest,163.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-16

They are working on the means to achieve that. Their greatest enemy they think is the United States. They think everyone else is a derivative. And they are developing the capacity to deliver on their slogans, death to America, death to Americans in between. So we have a grand mission. And it's not a mission that we invent. We didn't invent these ICBMs. We didn't invent their nuclear programming in which they seek to create nuclear weapons.

They say everything is settlement. Tel-Aviv is a settlement. Jerusalem is a settlement. Haifa is a settlement. We have to get rid of everything. And I think that some normalization in the Arab world could help us begin to change attitudes there. But even if we did, and I think they have to come and recognize the Jewish state.

25,HANNITY," So instead of admitting they were wrong, these media outlets, they have now doubled down on their attacks against President Trump. Now, let me explain. Let me give a little history lesson. Remember back in 2007, 2008? The media never vetted President Barack Obama and his radical ideological left-wing agenda. They didn't talk about Frank Marshall Davis, ACORN, being an Alinsky disciple. They didn't even bother to look into a relationship with his unrepentant domestic terrorist friend, Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn. He was asked one time about that, and it was a question that I fed to George Stephanopoulos on my radio show.  No, the media only asked about Ayers one time. And then Reverend Wright, the church of ""G-d America"" -- well, the press was a year behind that, too. And they barely covered the story. And if it was Donald Trump, you know it would be different. The media didn't want to report on Barack Obama's radical associations. We did on this program.  Then Obama became president. All right, he's in there eight years. The media didn't go anywhere near his real record on the economy! We were not afraid on this show to give you the real numbers. For example, millions more out of the labor force, millions more living in poverty, millions more on food stamps, and Obama accumulated more debt than every other president before him combined. When President Trump talks about inheriting a mess, those numbers are the ones he's referring to. And then there's Hillary Clinton. Ah! WikiLeaks, they exposed just how in bed the media was with her. Just take a look at all the media outlets that, for example, RSVPed to the 2015 dinner allegedly at John Podesta's house. It's all the major media outlets except for Fox News. And on election night, remember? After Donald Trump won, it was like a funeral at every one of these networks! Even Martha Raddatz, who hosted a debate, she was crying!

32,HANNITY," Martha Raddatz crying? Really? A whitelash? I guess everybody that voted for Trump is racist? That is how abusively biased the media in this country is. So here's where we are today. Has this abusively biased media changed?  Have they learned anything? Have they apologized for their collusion, their misreporting? Absolutely not. And worse, you look at what they're doing now. They're ignoring President Trump's accomplishments -- which we will go over tonight -- in 30 days. Now, they're never going to tell you, the American people, the truth. They have a clear radical left-wing agenda. And by the way, they're also lazy. They won't report that Trump has ordered federal agencies to ease the burden of ObamaCare and seeks to repeal and replace ObamaCare, that he took action to freeze new and pending regulations. He withdrew the U.S. from TPP, like he promised. He instituted a government hiring freeze. He banned, literally, you know, some countries from getting funds that provide abortions abroad, issued five executive actions advancing Keystone and the Dakota Access pipelines, which, by the way, will create jobs and lead to energy independence. And also, he issued actions on construction of a border wall, stripping money from sanctuary cities  -- all promises -- issued executive actions on extreme vetting -- he'll win that eventually -- also issued executive action on rebuilding the military. He issued executive action to draft a plan to defeat ISIS, which should probably be in his hands today or tomorrow. He instituted a five-year lobbying ban for administration officials so he can drain the swamp. He nominated an originalist to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch. He signed a House joint resolution, number 38, to help the coal industry get back into business, sanctioned Iran over their ballistic missile program, negotiated lower prices on F-35 fighter jets and Air Force One with companies like Intel -- with Boeing and others. Then, of course, he met with Intel, Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and all these other companies to incentivize them to come back into America and build jobs here. And of course, his economic plan will also help with that. He signed executive orders to protect police officers that are under fire.  He signed executive orders to target drug cartels. He launched a council for the advancement of women entrepreneurs. He called or met with over 30 foreign leaders so far. And Trump made a big announcement today by appointing Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster to be the new national security adviser. Is anybody in the press focused on any of this? They'd rather spend their days going after the president for a comment he makes about Sweden -- which, by the way, he was right about -- and the media is perfectly willing to continue to mislead and lie to you, the American people. It's so clear. They are collectively, the news media, at war with the president because their little egos are bruised, and they have been exposed. And they're waging this battle by focusing in on superfluous non- important issues, citing unnamed sources. And the press has called this president every name in the book. Are they inciting violence by calling him racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, a sexist, a liar, even a dictator?  Because they're basically throwing around names with the hopes something may stick one day, and they go out there and report breathlessly about whatever the tweet is of the day. But the biggest point I want to make tonight is this: The mainstream media's audience, their viewers, listeners, readers -- they are not you, the American people. They are not the forgotten men and women in poverty, on food stamps, out of the labor force, that can't buy a house. We have the lowest home ownership rate in 51 years. It's not the oceans of red in the middle of the country. See the little slivers of blue, coastal elites? Well, that's where the media's catering to. Out-of-touch liberals know nothing about you, nothing about your problems, don't seem to care about the millions more in poverty, on food stamps and out of work, the people that are struggling. Because they're trapped, overpaid, lazy, in their bubbles and seem to care less about the plight of the average hard-working blue-collar Americans that make this country great! That's why they didn't think that Donald Trump could win. It's why they can't for the life of them understand why he is connecting with the American people. And the American people are so happy that he's taking this corrupt, Pravda-like media on every day. Because you got an alt-left propaganda media, they have proven they can never be trusted. They lie, they mislead, they distort, and they have an agenda, a left-wing radical agenda. That's why they were colluding with Hillary. In reality, they're modern-day propagandists. You know, other countries, we see it, you know, liberal state-run media. They are the biggest mouthpiece for the left-wing in the country. This is gross malpractice because what they're doing to you, the American people, is a great disservice. They should be ashamed of themselves. This is exactly why the president calls them fake news, because you cannot trust them any longer. That's just a fact. Here with reaction, the host of ""Michelle Malkin Investigates"" on CRTV, our friend, Michelle Malkin. You know, Michelle, I'm going to -- you know, let me put up on the screen -- let's put up, Wikileaks, for one. Let's put up all the collusion and how it exposed them. And then as I'm putting it up there, I want you to answer -- did they not learn anything from this campaign after they were laughing at the idea of a President Trump, colluding with Hillary, and then losing?

I think Rush -- you know, Rush always (INAUDIBLE) Rush says -- Rush is right. Rush is right, is that they didn't elect him. They did everything they could do to defeat him. I worry if it becomes cumulative and if there's one little mistake -- they're throwing everything up against the wall, if he could hurt the president.",2,647.0,107.0,host,40.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-20
59,"JOE CONCHA, THE HILL"," I would say the president has the leverage right now, Sean, in terms of this war against the media. And I base that on numbers, not on an opinion. The Gallup survey on trust in media in September -- this is before Wikileaks that you've mentioned, so I would imagine these numbers are even worse -- 86 percent of Republicans don't trust the media. OK, we expect that. 70 of independents don't trust the media. Even half of Democrats. So Donald Trump has the leverage right now in terms of this war. But here's the problem, I think, in terms of journalists and what they think their job is now. It used to -- do an accurate story, good investigative journalism, you get a pat on the back. Now it's all about how many times am I going to say something provocative that gets retweeted by my media brethren? And oh, maybe I can get a story in Mediaite, the holy grail, and they'll talk about me. It's all about drawing attention to themselves instead of reporting accurately.

But I think talk about Trump attacks on the media are very exaggerated. I think, one, Trump has had a multi-decade relationship, a history of working with the press. He has a co-dependent relationship with them. Also, he has not used the power of the presidency to attack the press.

Joining us now with reaction, the president of Liberty University, Jerry Falwell, Jr., and from Samaritan's Purse Franklin Graham. So, first of all, I am reading comments about this. She got accused of plagiarizing by reciting the Lord's Prayer. All right, we all then are guilty for plagiarism by reciting this prayer. And they called it a dictatorship, and then some said, well, she was reading. She didn't look like she was reading. She looked like she was bowing her head to me. And I am thinking as far as I know, Reverend Graham, isn't this a Judeo-Christian country founded on Judeo-Christian principles?",5,754.0,127.0,host,107.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-20
153,"REV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM, SAMARITAN'S PURSE"," Sean, you are right. And listen, when Melania did this, I thought to myself this is the first time in American history of politics as far as I know where the first lady stood and recited the Lord's Prayer before she introduced her husband. I thought it was tremendous. It resonated, Sean, with not only millions of Christians here across this country but also around the world. I am talking about Christians halfway around the world that saw that. That encouraged them to think that the first lady would recite a prayer that the lord Jesus Christ gave. And here she is, reciting it before the whole world. I was so proud of her, and I just couldn't stop talking about it. I thought it was tremendous. And so I'm proud of her. I'm as proud as I can be of our first lady. And she is such a fine person. And of course, the left is going to attack her.  And Sean, they're going to do everything they can to try to beat up our president and his wife, the first lady, his children, they are going after everybody. But there are millions and millions of Christians out there that stood behind President Trump, and they are going to continue to stand behind him. And I just hope he keeps going forward, and I certainly hope the first lady is not discouraged because the left who want to try to embarrass her some way.

By the way, I'm not the Christian that either you or Franklin are. And your father knew it, that is why he used to call and say he was praying for me. He must have known instinctively I need a lot more help than you guys. But I thought it was a really touching, beautiful moment. And it was sincere. And a lot of people don't know. I've met Melania. She is lovely. She's kind. She is a great mom. She's a great support to the president.  English is not her first, second, third, or fourth. It's her fifth language. She is amazingly smart. And I just felt like, really, we're going to attack the 10-year-old kid and then we're going to attack Ivanka, we're attacking girls and the wife of the president.

155,"JERRY FALWELL JR., LIBERTY UNIVERSITY"," I thought she was so classy. It was such a classy thing to do. I agree with Franklin 100 percent. This is tradition in American history, Franklin prayed at the inauguration. I read the scripture that contains the Lord's Prayer at the private service which was right before the inauguration which has been a tradition for generations for all new presidents. And it is such a perversion of the idea of separation of church and state, what our founders meant by that, that the judicial activists have created in this century. And I know, I live right here in Virginia, my family has lived here since before the Revolutionary War. Thomas Jefferson's farm is a few farms over from mine. And I will tell you what he meant by separation of church and state. At that time the Virginia colony was under the British throne, and every single citizen was required to be a member of the Anglican Church and to pay tithes to the Anglican Church. The only problem with that is the king appointed the archbishop, so the king controlled the church, bought up much of the land in Virginia, and after the revolution, Thomas Jefferson was determined to never let the church be used by the state to control the people again. That's what he meant by separation of church and state.",5,1260.0,226.0,guest,110.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-20

0,"SEAN HANNITY, HOST"," Welcome to ""Hannity."" So President Trump -- he fulfills yet another key campaign promise by moving forward with a plan to strengthen American's southern border and deport criminal illegal aliens.  And that is tonight's ""Opening Monologue."" Department of Homeland Security Secretary General John Kelly announced earlier today new guidelines to implement President Trump's agenda on immigration. Now, they include prioritizing the removal of criminal aliens who have been convicted of any criminal offense, who have been charged with any criminal offense that has not yet been resolved, and who have committed potentially chargeable criminal acts. DHS is also calling for hiring an additional 10,000 ICE agents, 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, expanding the 287G program which allows local police to act as immigration agents, starting the planning and construction, of course, of the border wall, ending catch-and-release and restoring the Secure Communities program which was shut down by the Obama administration. Also, returning aliens to their country of origin, creating the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office, or VOICE, which is meant to help families that are impacted by illegal immigrant crimes. Also identifying aid to Mexico and commissioning a study on border security to better determine what works and what does not work. Now, it's important to note that Dreamers are not impacted by these new orders. But you can guarantee that the liberals and their friends in the alt left propaganda media, they're going to spin and distort what these guidelines are all about. But if you take a complete and honest and unbiased look at what President Trump is trying to do, then you'll see it's all pretty simple. He's securing our borders, trying to stop crimes against Americans, preventing drugs from entering this country, arms from entering this country. He wants to stop drug trafficking. You see there? I've personally been down to the border over a dozen times on boat, all-terrain vehicle. I've been in helicopters, I've been on horseback. I have seen these drug warehouses -- look there -- floor to ceiling, the biggest warehouse you've ever seen. I've seen drug tunnels and illegal immigrants being detained. I saw a gang member being arrested.  And just a couple of weeks ago, one of our ""Hannity"" producers caught on video Border Patrol agents -- see that? Four hundred pounds of drugs headed right into your community. Now, I'm speaking tonight from first-hand experience because as far as I know, nobody else in the media has taken the time to go down to the border as much as I have and look up close and personally to what's really happening and how bad it is. Now back in 2014 during one of my trips, I sat through a briefing. It was eye-opening. This was with former Texas Governor Rick Perry where we were just told how bad illegal immigrant crimes were for the state of Texas alone -- 642,000 crimes. Watch this.",1,2954.0,487.0,host,1.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-21

5,HANNITY," 642,000 crimes against Texans alone in a seven-year period. Now, there are other statistics that are just as shocking. According to a 2015 report from the Immigration Policy Institute -- get this -- an estimated 820,000 of the projected 11 million illegal immigrants living in America are convicted criminals. And look at the numbers. In fiscal year 2015, 36.6 percent of the over 70,000 federal sentences were for crimes committed by illegal aliens. Now, these aren't just numbers that we're talking about here. These are people, your citizens, fellow citizens, Americans directly impacted by illegal immigrant crimes. Now, there's no -- also, to add to this, the massive costs. You, the American taxpayer, are paying a fortune. According to a study from the Federal American Immigration Reform (sic), illegal immigration -- get this -- costs states and local governments $113 billion a year for things like education, for medicine, medical treatment, public assistance, judicial costs, criminal justice costs -- huge amounts of money. Then there's the cost to individual border states. Let's take a look at some of the numbers. For example, if you live in California, illegal immigration is estimated to cost an astounding $25.3 billion a year. If you live in the state of Texas, you're on the hook if you're a taxpayer, for $12.1 billion annually. That is taxpayer money. That's supposed to go to your towns and communities, your hospitals, your educational facilities.  But no, it's going to pay for illegal immigrants. The good news is this: President Trump, he's laid out a comprehensive plan to fix the problem, to make our communities safer and to save you, the American taxpayer, obviously, a fortune. Here with reaction, Fox News senior correspondent Geraldo Rivera. You're looking at those numbers -- you're a -- you're a great attorney. That's a very strong case that the cost to the American -- the average American is massive! We're paying a huge price!",1,1968.0,323.0,host,4.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-21

98,HANNITY," That was President Trump taking his message directly to you, the American people, over the weekend, promising to secure our borders and make America's neighborhoods safe again. Earlier today, the Department of Homeland Security -- they unveiled new immigration enforcement guidelines - - by the way, not new laws because laws are already on the books. Joining us now, the editor-in-chief of Lifezette, Fox News contributor, radio talk show host nationally syndicated Laura Ingraham. People I don't think understand what conservatism means. Let me -- just give me a second to lay this out. Here's what I want for my fellow Americans. I want our borders and our country safe and secure from those that would want to bring drugs and gangs and radical Islamic violence to our country. You know what? There's 13 million more Americans on food stamps. I want them to get off and have a job. 8 million more in poverty, I want the American dream for them. 95 million Americans out of the labor force, the lowest home lowest home ownership rate in 51 years, and I like the economy to flourish so everybody can have a good life. Isn't that what it really comes down to, why we support these policies of President Trump? Isn't it that simple?",2,1232.0,215.0,host,79.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-21
99,"LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," Yes, I think being a conservative, Sean, requires that we want to conserve all that is good about America, our independence, our freedom, our belief in our Constitution, our traditions, our language, our sovereignty. We want to conserve. We want to conserve the good stuff. And when we have a rampant gang culture fueled in part by illegal immigrants in the United States -- not all illegal immigrants, but a shocking number -- just in northern Virginia, where just a few days ago, we had a mass arrest in northern Virginia of 10 individuals, including illegal immigrants who became part of what is MS 13 -- you've talked about it, one of the most vicious, violent gangs in the world, fueling the most savage violence in northern Virginia! We got a big problem on our hands. And it's not about being heartless or cruel or mean. What Donald Trump is doing now as president is fulfilling his promise to do a better job at keeping Americans safe. It doesn't mean it's going to be 100 percent safe. It's never going to be that. But if we can save one life because we're enforcing our border and actually enforcing our laws, then that should actually turn everybody's heads around on this issue. So I applaud what he said. I was there at that rally in Melbourne with the president on Saturday. The reaction from the crowd, which I think was a lot more than 9,000 people, by the way, but it was a massive crowd -- was just overwhelmingly positive. Some of it gets publicized, some of it doesn't.",2,1490.0,269.0,guest,80.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-21

They're not struggling to pay their mortgages like I did for two decades of my life, and put food on my table like so many of you Americans working so hard for so little, and the government taking more and more every day. So let me be clear, to the whiny crybaby snowflakes in the liberal alt-left media that are worried about their safety, how about you lead by example and maybe stop calling the president and comparing him to Hitler? Let's start there. Joining us know, former Trump campaign manager, partner at Avenue Strategies, Corey Lewandowski, New York City independent Mayoral candidate Bo Dietl is with us. Corey, is there any name Trump hasn't been called?  Are they inciting violence against him if we're going to use this ridiculous analogy of theirs?",3,1007.0,179.0,host,122.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-21

This is the problem with the media. You finally have the president who not only has the ability to hit back but will hit back, who will call people out when they're wrong. No president has ever been willing to take on the fourth estate, the media, because they've been so afraid of. He is willing to add he's fighting for the American people.

I like Chris Cuomo, I like his father Mario very much and Andrew.

I happen to be in Chicago last weekend and gave a speech there with Bob Costa from ""The Washington Post,"" and had a couple hundred protesters.

171,CAIN," No, I don't think so. Look, those protests on Presidents' Day, they did not succeed in changing anybody's minds. In fact, I believe that the protests encouraged conservatives and Republicans to stay the course. The RNC just announced that for the month of January, it had a record fundraising month. Now, people would be giving money like that to the RNC if they didn't believe in, one, President Trump's agenda, the accomplishments he's made in one month, in one day, that wouldn't be happening. What I think that the protesters are doing, they are pitching their temper tantrum, thinking that it's going to endear some support from some people that really are not paying attention because they know what's going on. And one other thing, Howard Dean is talking about Hillary Clinton losing, and Donald Trump winning, that they are traumatized. No, not the ones that are being paid to be there. They are not traumatized. They will continue to protest until the money runs out. That's what's going on.",4,1001.0,171.0,guest,138.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-21

193,HANNITY," That was President Trump earlier today addressing the issue of anti-Semitism after nearly a dozen Jewish community centers all around the country received bomb threats yesterday. The left has been quick to try and blame the president for the rise in these threats, but in their search for a new DNC chair, which will be selected on Saturday, the leading contender is Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison. Ellison has a very controversial association with the leader of the Nation of Islam, and that is Louis Farrakhan. In fact he reportedly backed out of an interview with The New York Times back in November after being told that he would be asked about this relationship with Farrakhan. And take a look at the headline from ""The New York Times"" article in December, quote, ""Jewish groups and unions grow uneasy with Keith Ellison."" Joining us now with reaction, the president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs Dore Gold, and Fox News contributor and former Clinton pollster Doug Schoen. Dore, I was very, very impressed. I had time with the prime minister, as you know, after he met with the president. And what he said publicly is what he told me privately, that there's never been a better supporter for Israel than this president in his lifetime. And that's how I see this relationship. He's been very clear. I think speaking out today is another example of it. What's your reaction?",5,1397.0,239.0,host,155.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-21
194,"DORE GOLD, PRESIDENT, JERUSALEM CENTER FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS"," Look, this is a very serious subject, anti-Semitism. And if we were in Europe right now, if we were in France or Germany, we'd have a number of possible suspects.  We could have neo-Nazis. We could have Islamic radicals. We could have the far left. All three have been associated with hate crimes against Jews in Europe. One of the first things you have to do is make sure you have enough manpower and enough people to get to the bottom of these acts, and then act accordingly.",5,478.0,89.0,guest,156.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-21
195,HANNITY," I agree totally with you. So this weekend to Detroit, Doug, Louis Farrakhan has an association with Keith Ellison who may be the head of the DNC. Anyway, ""I want to disabuse the Jews today of the false claim that you are the chosen of God, that Israel or Palestine belongs to you. I want to disabuse you of that, and I'm going to tell you about your future. You think you have the power to frighten and dominate the peoples of the world?

196,"DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," That's horrific. I will be startled and ashamed of my party if Keith Ellison for a number of years and as yet as I speak to disavow the Reverend Louis Farrakhan, if he is elected DNC chairman. Dore Gold is speaking exactly right. We have the BBS movement where Europeans and many around the world are seeking to just delegitimize Israel by simply saying any products made in Israel cannot be purchased at all by anyone. This is a scary, scary time, and I'm glad the president spoke out. And I speak as a Democrat and as a Jew and as someone who is passionate.",5,560.0,106.0,guest,158.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-21

201,HANNITY," What is your reaction to that, Dore? You work with people from both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democratic presidents. I don't think Israeli-American relations have been any worse than under President Obama. Are you uncomfortable with the Democratic Party picking somebody like Keith Ellison and his controversial past?",5,328.0,51.0,host,163.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-21
202,GOLD," Keith Ellison doesn't have much to offer us. But let me just put it this way. I think we should avoid politicizing this issue. This is very serious. And therefore of course if somebody has associations with the Muslim Brotherhood to or with Louis Farrakhan, that's a real problem. But fundamentally I know everybody is tempted to politicize these issues, and it's a big mistake to go down that route. And I think what we have to do is root of this out. Get to the bottom of it. Assign enough FBI agents, find out who's behind it. By the way, this has been going on for a while, just now reaching levels that are getting a lot of press attention. I noticed there's a piece in ""The Washington Post"" by an Oppenheimer just a few days on the 17th. And he wrote that he was citing the AGL statistics that the number of anti-Semitic incidents on United States campuses doubled in 2015. Nobody talked about that as far as I can recall. So we've got a big problem on our hands, and it's got to be tackled, and not politicized.",5,1019.0,192.0,guest,164.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-21
203,HANNITY," I agree, but I don't think we can ignore this. When he was a third-year law student he was responding another student that said Louis Farrakhan was no Malcolm X. He defended Farrakhan against charges of racism. He said ""racism means conspiracy to subjugate and actual subjugation, and that means planned social-economic political subjugation of whites. It cannot be intelligently argued that the Nation of Islam is doing this. In fact, blacks have no history of harming or subjecting whites as a class."" And I'm sorry, and he organized for the Million Man March out of his community. You cannot just ignore the white people, God that teaches meat tell me the white people are the skunk of the planet earth, or that Judaism, that famous quote, ""got a religion,"" and ""real Jews,"" and constant referring, using anti-Semitic slurs.",5,828.0,140.0,host,165.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-21

How about an economic plan? Isn't it great?  How did Donald Trump get Carrier to stay? How did Donald Trump talk Ford into staying and not bringing plants to Mexico? How did he try to -- how did he keep Fiat Chrysler? You notice every company now wants to meet with the president, say,"" I'm spending $7 trillion right now,"" because they want the free publicity. But also, they know that better times are ahead because if the president is able with the help of Congress to fulfill his economic plan. Think of what we've got. We've got multinational corporations, trillions of dollars parked overseas, they won't bring the money back because they're going to have to pay confiscatory taxes. Donald Trump, our president, says, ""We'll give you a 10 percent rate, bring the money back, build your factory here, invest in America, build your manufacturing centers here, and let the forgotten men and women in Detroit, Michigan, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in Cleveland, Ohio, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania -- let them have opportunities that they have.""",1,1392.0,234.0,host,24.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-22

So President Trump has initiated probably about 23, 24 executive actions since he got on the job a little over a month ago, Sean. Basically, one of them has gotten all of the attention. And I think there's something called presumptive negativity. It's, What is he saying, what are his advisers saying, what are they doing today? There must be something wrong with it, must be something negative. And I just would ask people, give us a wide berth. Actually focus on what he's doing. He's keeping all these campaign promises at a quick clip. And he's never a guy who's in a rush to do the wrong thing. His entire career, which has been decidedly outside of politics and government, has been one of deliberation, of deal making. I mean, he just absorbs information. I've never seen a more brilliant communicator, a more natural connector with individuals, with information, with issues. And he's been the transactional guy his entire life. He absorbs the information he needs. He weighs the consequences. And he's been doing that as president in the first month. But the list is long and growing.

We had an amazing team and of course no substitute for excellent quality candidates in Donald Trump and Mike Pence, no question. But even if it wasn't your victory and your choice, it is your future. It is a future shared by all. And the idea that you don't respect the offense of the presidency and its current occupant, at least give him a chance to succeed. This was not the way I was raised, anyway. And the attacks are one thing. I think when you work for President Trump, you take his lead and his guidance on that.

You can win, you can't win, she can't win. There are these three poisonous words, ""You can win, you can't win,"" are sucking the lifeblood out of our would-be nominees. And Donald Trump replaced electability with electricity. He went back to the grassroots and said come with me. I'm not building a traditional campaign, I'm building a movement. And people felt like they were a part of that. Even if you didn't support him at the beginning, people felt like they were a part of it.

And I think that female candidates often can benefit from being seen as great negotiators, consensus builders, fresh and new to politics. There's a reason you never heard the term the old girl's network, there isn't one. And so women are often seen as less corruptible, more ethical, et cetera. And she is just not confused with any of that. But I think, look, it's a great question because people are somewhat entranced by gender.

189,CONWAY," Thank you. First, we accept all comers in terms of people who would like to serve and help this administration, so give me a call, and I mean that. Look me up, give me a call. In terms of starting in politics, I think one thing everybody regardless of their gender has to realize right now is that the old saying you have to have the fire in your belly is true, but now you also have to have the bile in your throat. There's a lot to swallow in today's politics, a lot of negativity, a lot of venom. And just to look past that and really focus on the issues and ideas that motivate you. I think for women starting out in politics, I would say do what you do regardless of industry. Accept the word ""no"" more than often than you say it. And so if people are asking you to volunteer or help out or come to something on the weekend, just do it. Don't say no to it because I don't think opportunity always knocks twice. Learn the fundamentals, get with the grassroots. Learn how to organize a prescient, how to write a press release, how to engage with folks door to door because there's no substitute for retail politics. Look what happened in this election. Had we not had the grassroots, had we not had a candidate in Donald Trump who refuse to have, did not need as much money, as much personnel as Hillary Clinton had, and did it through force of going out and talking about substance and issues, that would be my information.

It's always wrong. If you remember, you know, the campaign was the most chaotic -- you know, by the media's description, most chaotic, most disorganized, most unprofessional, had no earthly idea what they were doing. And then you saw them all crying and weeping that night. Just like they were dead wrong on the chaos of the campaign and just like they were dead wrong on the chaos of the transition, they are absolutely dead wrong about what's going on today because we have a team that's just grinding it through on (ph) President Donald Trump promised the American people.

8,BANNON," If you want to see the Trump agenda, it's very simple. It was all in the speeches. He went around to these rallies, but those speeches had a tremendous amount of content in them, right? All he's doing right now is, he's laid out an agenda with those speeches with the promises he made. And our job every day is just to execute on that. It's to simply get a path to how those get executed. And he's maniacally focused on that. Every business leader we've had in is saying not just taxes, but it is -- it is also the regulation. I think the consistent -- if you look at these cabinet appointees, they were selected for a reason, and that is the deconstruction. The way the progressive left runs, is if they can't get it passed, they're just going to put it in some sort of regulation in -- in an agency.

They were rough on the transition and rough on the campaign. So for those three reasons, I think Steve is right. But Kimberly, this is a great day for the administration. The messaging was fantastic. People got to see the harmony between Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon, which isn't well reported in the media. And they also got to hear from the vice president. And so the messaging was fantastic. It's a great lead-in for President Trump tomorrow. And the really good news is the business council dinner is going on in D.C. right now. There's 100 business leaders down there. I left D.C. a couple hours ago. And the business community is very fired up about the president, and you can see it in the stock market.",1,789.0,142.0,guest,12.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23

The idea right now -- and Austan's not going to like this, but the idea right how is to unravel all those regulations, which has led to the 1 percent growth. And so give it a little bit of time, and you'll see the economy humming. Steve Mnuchin was on this morning talking about the tax policies. There will be a harmony here, and the team is really starting to come together. I thought the messaging was fantastic today.",1,512.0,94.0,guest,14.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23

27,GOOLSBEE," Yes. You know, I guess I would object to one thing, which is he portrayed it that chaos is completely created by the media and not reality.  But you know, let's remember it was not the media who hired and then had to fire the national security adviser in the first three weeks. It was not the media who signed an executive order on immigration that three different federal courts said was unconstitutional and ill thought through. It wasn't the media who promised during the campaign to have a secret plan to replace ""Obama care"" that was going to cost less, cover all Americans and be better in every dimension, when in fact, Donald Trump had no such plan and they're scrambling now to figure it out. And I think it -- maybe it wasn't the right venue, but this -- we could never admit that we did anything wrong, that we ever made an error or that were going to try to fix it -- I think is not healthy. And I think the Trump people run the risk of squandering their honeymoon. This is when you pass things.

Austan and I are going to disagree on this, OK? The president does have a plan, and the president is promulgating that plan every day. Are there going to be mistakes in the early part of the administration?  Nobody knows that better than Austan Goolsbee. We saw that happen in many administrations. But the gelling of the team is there. The messaging is getting tighter. And I can see him smiling because he knows it's true. And so the stock market, something that Austan and I follow very closely, has been on a tear. And that's because people see growth. They see a tax cut coming. They see earnings revitalization and profits for companies.  And you know what else they see? They see middle-class wages growing because of President Trump's agenda and his jobs program. And so yes, is it perfect? Nothing's perfect. But I like what I see, and I know that over the next 60 days, Austan, you're going to be very happy with this administration.",1,1109.0,201.0,guest,22.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23

38,GOOLSBEE," ... he has the lowest approval rating in the history of polling for new presidents. And that includes the FOX News poll. So I would be a little careful. He did strike a chord. We saw wage growth over the last one-and-a-half years, but for sure, we've gone through a 25-year period that's been very tough on ordinary Americans. Now, I hope that he does succeed at continuing the growth that we've had and the 15 million jobs we've added in the last seven years. I hope he continues that. That would be great for the economy. But he has not followed, let's call it the JFK strategy. JFK barely wins the election. He wins actually bigger than Trump won, but it's a very narrow victory. So he comes in, and the first thing he does is he says, I'm going to appoint Republicans to major positions in my cabinet, and I'm going to start a policy of things that we agree on. And hey, give me a chance. I'll govern for both sides. Trump has not taken that approach, and I think it will cost him after a few years.",1,1004.0,192.0,guest,28.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23

The president came as a change agent, Kimberly, and the American people are listening. And listen, the -- we can talk about the polls if you want, but I think the results are really what are going to matter, and let's give this a little bit of time.

But his job is, by far, one of the toughest jobs I've ever seen in my life.  To make it run every day and to make the trains -- and you only see the surface. What's going on underneath in planning what's three weeks down the road to the -- to the degree that we're planning it, of all these EOs and legislation and -- you know, whether it's the tax reform bill, Reince is indefatigable in saying, We've got to drive this forward, we've got to drive this forward. And I think it's one of the reasons we have such a -- and by the way, this started back in August. You know, when we had this campaign. We were outgunned, outmanned, you know, outspent. And it was because President Trump had a message. He had this charisma, and he had people like here at CPAC.

You have the two top guys in there. Does this put to rest the theory that Priebus and Bannon don't get along?",2,291.0,52.0,guest,44.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23
62,BENNETT," Well, it should, but I doubt that it will. I love Reince, but we've seen Reince before, Kimberly. But Steve Bannon -- this was a sunlight debut for Steve Bannon. No, look, they're different guys, but they get along very well. And I must say, this was the right kind of debut for Steve Bannon. I mean, I think you know him a little bit. The guy was direct but not dark. He was straightforward but not sinister. He was candid but not, you know, scary. And so I think he did fine. Obviously, a very smart guy, operating at a high level and engaged in a high-level argument, which no doubt the media and the corporatists, as he called them, will now take up. Are there going to be rivalries in the White House? Of course. Will there be differences of opinion between the chief of staff and the chief strategist? Of course. I mean, I remember, you know, being a near secretary of education being summoned to the White House many times because of disagreements. It was usually because I wanted a lower budget, and some of President Reagan's people wanted a higher budget, but Ronald Reagan always fixed that. But no, they'll be -- these are strong men with strong points of view. The issues are tough, the load is incredible, and so there will be differences.  But I thought it was just fine and a good idea.",2,1303.0,242.0,guest,45.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23
63,GUILFOYLE," Probably a good idea, you're right, because otherwise, there's been a lot of sort of public discourse about it. We've seen things on ""Saturday Night Live"" and otherwise. This man then went forward to speak on his own behalf, Steve Bannon did, someone who was such a big part of the movement across this country, the Trump movement that brought out in droves the working class men and women of America that thought that they were forgotten. So it's nice to perhaps hear from someone who's on the inside. And talk to me a little bit about, you know, the messaging and now the movement and direction of the conservative party.",2,624.0,112.0,guest,46.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23
64,BENNETT," Yes, well, I think it is a conservative Trump party a Trump conservative party, a little bit different coloration, a little bit different emphasis. But there's a clear intellectual base to this. You can accuse Steve Bannon, I guess, of a lot of things, maybe gratuitously after today, but he's very, very smart, as is Reince Priebus. You saw a lot of enthusiasm there at CPAC, too. What I thought was key, Kimberly -- I don't know if you thought this -- was that Matt Schlapp, who was the host, and Reince both talked about the fusion of conservatism and the Republican Party and that that is a kind of unstoppable force. I don't know if it's always unstoppable, but it's pretty formidable. And you remember all the gnashing of teeth and rending of garments during the campaign, if Trump should be elected, it would be a total split of conservatism and Republicanism. It's not. It's finding its way, and again, there will still be disagreements. But the -- what's the old saying? The dogs bark, but the caravans moves forward? The dogs are barking -- I thought that was -- by the way, it was very interesting, too, what Bannon had to say about the press. If you think the press, the mainstream media, will give up this country without a fight, you've got another think coming.",2,1277.0,229.0,guest,47.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23

90,GUILFOYLE, Very curious to hear -- what did you see on your tour of the border yesterday? And did anything that you see impact or change your opinion about what's necessary?,3,163.0,31.0,guest,66.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23
91,MCCAUL," Well, it was a very productive trip to have the speaker come down.  He's never seen it before. You really have to see the border to understand it. He saw it from the air, Black Hawk helicopter, by river in patrol boats and by land on horseback. And I think a lot of what we saw most importantly is the morale of Border Patrol has increased exponentially since the last time I was down there. I think that's because they have now a president in the White House that supports them, and we now have the political will to finally get this done.  And I just can't emphasize that enough. I think one of the great takeaways also, Kimberly, was when you look at what you call the wall or infrastructure to provide physical barriers, they have in McAllen a levee system that's made of concrete that I think can provide a very creative way that the community accepts because it helps against flood, to provide a flood control, a way to put concrete down there, but not to offend the local communities down on the border. We in Texas have a difficult challenge because unlike San Diego and El Paso, which has a lot of fencing already, we have a river that goes from El Paso down to the -- down to McAllen and into the Gulf of Mexico. So I thought it was very insightful, and I think there's some great takeaways spread",3,1308.0,246.0,guest,67.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23
92,GUILFOYLE," OK, so I was reading some articles earlier, and you are on record saying that you didn't believe perhaps that they wall might be necessary based on what you saw. What did you mean by that?",3,189.0,37.0,guest,68.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23
93,MCCAUL," I said consistently physical barriers are necessary. I think we're going to see more fencing down there. I think these levees, when you look at the levees, they are made out of concrete and they do provide a wall, a physical concrete wall in the Rio Grande Valley. But I think you have to have a smart border too that not only relies on physical barriers but also technology. Kimberly, it's very important to have aviation assets, sensors, surveillance, so we have 100 percent visibility to see from the sky what's happening on the ground, and sensor cameras to pick up what's happening as well.",3,596.0,106.0,guest,69.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23
94,GUILFOYLE," You have to utilize all the tools necessary to be able to effectuate that safety and national security. Just real quick, what are you looking for to see in a talks between Mexico and our new secretary of state Rex Tillerson?",3,225.0,42.0,guest,70.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23
95,MCCAUL," I think to have a concerted effort to secure our southern border and, quite frankly, Mexico's southern border. They have a border problem of their own, and I think working together with Mexico to get this thing done is very important. I think Rex Tillerson is a talented guy who I think can accomplish that. I talked to the Mexican ambassador myself, and he wants to work with us to get that security. And I think it's possible.",3,429.0,79.0,guest,71.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23

99,"REP. JOHN CARTER, R-TEXAS"," The speaker made a whirlwind tour, but he got to see every element of what we've got on the southern border. The southern border of Texas is very peculiar and different from any of the rest of the southern border in California, Arizona, or New Mexico because of the river. Not only because of the river, but because people own the land that borders that river. And that makes a big difference in what we can do down there. The speaker saw the challenges. I think he's got a real good view of what's going on.",3,509.0,97.0,guest,75.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23

101,CARTER," I think the wall will be built, and walls where walls will work will be built hopefully shortly. How it's going to be paid for, that's going to be up for the various negotiations that are going on and what the other committees are working on as a way of coming up with the funding to pay for the wall. All that will be up in the air temporarily, but I'm looking forward to supplementary that we're going to get in March.  Hopefully we'll have funds for homeland security which allows us to get started on this.",3,511.0,98.0,guest,77.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23

So Charlie, what do you think about Congressman Ellison's remarks? He thinks already that President Trump has done enough damage or sufficient means to impeach them, which is shock and awe right there?",4,447.0,72.0,guest,87.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23
117,"CHARLES HURT, POLITICAL COLUMNIST, WASHINGTON TIMES"," It is definitely shock and awe. We've looked at eight years where Democrats have failed to lead. They've failed to behave like adults here in Washington. Voters have completely thrown them out of power. They don't have a single lever of power anywhere. And now their only responsibility is to be the loyal opposition, and they can't even do that. Ellison is acting like a spoiled child throwing a hissy fit. And I think it's a perfect example of why Democrats managed to lose 1,000 seats since Barack Obama first won election eight years ago.",4,543.0,96.0,guest,88.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23
118,GUILFOYLE," Yes. Steve, what do you think the strategy is here? They suffered devastating losses in the House, in the Senate. They lost the Oval when they were counting on it. They were counting their money and the cards of the table. What is the point here? They seem to now want to go all the way to the left with these bomb throwing statements?",4,336.0,65.0,guest,89.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23
119,"STEVE HILTON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," I think the specific immediate point is Keith Ellison trying to win the election, and so he's basically saying what his base wants to hear. In other words, it might be pandering. But I think the bigger point is that actually in a broader sense it may serve him well for his audience on the weekend in the DNC chair election, but generally speaking I think this kind of over-the-top rhetoric really undermines the credibility of the person who says it. It actually introduces an element of hate and divisiveness to politics which I thought the Democrats were against. But on the other hand, if you're looking at it as a Republican, I think this kind of stuff actually is something you should be cheering on, because as long as the Democrats wallow in their hatred of Trump and don't do the hard work of really figuring out why, as you said, they lost elections up and down the ballot right across the country and why working people in America no longer believe that the Democratic Party represents them, then that will help Republicans in the long run.",4,1052.0,189.0,guest,90.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23
120,GUILFOYLE," Richard, what is the explanation for this kind of lunacy in this bizarre behavior? Making comments like that, do you think that Ellison is the odd-on favorite? Is he going to be able to achieve this by tacking to the left of everyone else that he is up against?",4,262.0,50.0,guest,91.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23
121,"RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," We'll have to see. I think the election will find itself out on Saturday. The hissy fit is an interesting word that Charlie uses there, because if my memory serves me correctly, about eight years ago, a guy named Donald Trump went around the country and talked about Obama's birth certificate and he threw a rather big hissy fit. Sadly he's president today. But here's the problem. I think instead of worried about what the Democrats are doing, Republicans should start legislating. By the time in Obama's legacy, the Democrats had passed at least four or five bills.  Right now, Republicans have passed wait for it, wait for it Kimberly - goose egg. Zero bills. Zero bills to the president's desk.",4,699.0,122.0,guest,92.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23
122,HURT," You raise a very interesting point, and I'm not defending Republicans here, but my goodness, what does that say about Democrats that this monster you talk about eight years ago is not sitting at the White House? Isn't that evidence that Democrats have completely failed on every level?",4,286.0,49.0,guest,93.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23
123,FOWLER," Charlie, that's a good point. I think it's less about that.  Don't get me wrong, I think we got the selection wrong. I'll be the first to tell you that. But with that being said I think at the rate that Donald Trump is going, Republicans should also look in the mirror. Here's the point, Kimberly, think about this way. Anything the president says makes news. So when the president goes out there and says there's a quote- unquote ""attack in Sweden"" and he says it, it's false. And when it's false, false is a synonym for fake. So the president is a perpetuator of fake news even though he says he's against fake news.",4,619.0,116.0,guest,94.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23

And if the words they use, these over-the-top hysterical statements, that is not good to serve them well in trying to win elections in the years ahead.",4,490.0,91.0,guest,96.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23

157,GUILFOYLE," And joining us now on the phone is Sean Hannity. Sean, so many incredible memories and moments, and uncertainly the dynamic duo, that team of ""Hannity & Colmes"" is one of the greatest teams in all of television, and people really loved watching the two of you together. You had such a wonderful relationship. I was lucky to be able to witness it firsthand being part of your show, and seeing the two of you work together to cover American history and politics like nobody ever did. Your thoughts here?  And I know you must be missing and remembering your friend.",5,563.0,102.0,guest,122.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23
158,HANNITY," You know, K.G., it brings back so many fine memories. I want to, by the way, thank all of you and the guys at ""The Five"" and Neil Cavuto and Shep Smith and Bill Hemmer and Shannon Bream everybody at Fox. The one thing that stands out as I listen to that again, and it just brings back all the memories of all the fun. When we started out, neither one of us had a whole heck of a lot of TV experience. I'm now in my 21st year so I guess I'm pretty experienced now.  But we were just hoping to try to survive. And to do that, we developed a friendship. Our political differences were real. He was as liberal as you could get. He believed it passionately. People remember us for that back and forth in the debate, and sometimes it would be contentious. But at the end of the day we had a common goal. We wanted to this show to succeed, and it did. We ended up beating Larry King who was just an icon in cable news at that time. And we never looked back. And it was always the number one show in its time slot and also the number two show on cable news for a long time. I was very, very blessed. And we always would say to each other, we would say how lucky we were that Fox took a chance and Roger Ailes took a chance on us and put us on the air, and also gave us the time to grow. And the one thing you saw and heard there is Alan's great sense of humor.  What was really hard about debating Alan is because he was a former standup comic, he was a great radio guy, he loved radio, loved his audience, loved the microphone, but he had a sense of timing that was impeccable. And I'd be thinking, I just made the greatest point ever. He'd crack a joke and off into the ether whatever great point I thought I made. And I want to say one other thing, K.G. Everybody in the building loved him. And the one thing about Alan is he was one of the most liked people at Fox News ever. And there's a lot of infighting sometimes in cable news.  Not with Alan. Alan was loved by everybody. And he had a decency that transcended all politics. And in this day and age, that's kind of a refreshing thing to hear. Really my thoughts and prayers tonight are with his wife, Jocelyn, of course his sister-in-law, our friend Monica Crowley, his whole family, Rory, his manager, who was with him his entire career. They are all devastated and heartbroken as we are. And my prayers are with all of them tonight. He was a friend. And one other thing. He faced -- I won't go into the details of what he faced. We had our offices next to each other, we talked all the time, and he came and they told him the story about his illness.  He was very optimistic. And he said my only fear about this even though he was facing a daunting, a daunting challenge, his only fear was, oh, I don't want my wife to worry about me. I don't want her to suffer. I don't want her to go through all of this. And it just speaks volumes of about a guy that had that kind of love and compassion and real humanity about him that he always put other people first. And I was very honored to have him as a partner through all these years.  We had so much fun. We worked so hard together, and we had a common goal to deliver to our audience every night the best show we could. You can't replace him. He's just going to be missed sorely and dearly. And our hearts are broken tonight.",5,3327.0,660.0,host,123.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-23

You can check it out on ""Hannity"" as well.  Really lovely, Sean, and you were wonderful to him and I know how much you appreciated working with him together.

160,HANNITY," He loved the show on Fox News. He loved radio, all the time he had on the air. He loved doing the show. And I've got to say, all of our colleagues have been absolutely amazing today. The tribute you did on ""The Five,"" Neil Cavuto, Shepard Smith, everyone has been so amazing. I got the nicest note from Dana, your colleague, and others today. And I'm very appreciative.

They make up sources.  They're very dishonest people.  In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people, the fake news.  They dropped off the word ""fake.""  And all of a sudden, the story became the media is the enemy. They take the word ""fake"" out. I'm against the people that make up stories and make up sources.  They shouldn't be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody's name.

The bottom line -- we're changing it.  We're going to make it much better.   We're going to make it less expensive. Remember the lie, 28 times.  You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan, over and over and over again you heard it.  So we're going to repeal and replace ObamaCare.",1,435.0,79.0,guest,10.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24

20,GUILFOYLE,"  And there you go.  Joining us for reaction is American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp and Fox News contributor Herman Cain. Matt, I'll begin with you.  What did you think of the president's speech today?  And what was his reaction when you first asked him to speak there?",1,283.0,49.0,guest,11.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
21,"MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION CHAIRMAN","  Oh, yes.  He talked about that.  He said, like he always does, Of course I would be there.  And one of the things he said -- I want to be there because I want to thank these folks who stood with me. And after the speech, I want you to know, he seemed really pumped up by the response from the crowd.  I mean, conservatives are so hungry to start winning and to start having victories, and they are just -- I can't tell you -- it was emotional.  They just want a leader who will fight, and he's showing them how to fight.",1,522.0,105.0,guest,12.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
22,GUILFOYLE,"  You know, it was interesting, Herman, because people were talking about, Well, you know, if you wanted red meat, you got it. Yesterday with Steve Bannon and with the president today, many were saying it almost sounded like a campaign speech again, giving them kind of what they want and talking about what he was intending to accomplish.",1,339.0,59.0,guest,13.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
23,"HERMAN CAIN, FOX CONTRIBUTOR",  I want to congratulate Matt because this is the first time in my memory that CPAC has been able to get the president and all of his top people to speak.  Kudos to Matt and his organization.,1,191.0,38.0,guest,14.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24

26,,(LAUGHTER),1,,,,,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
27,CAIN,"  -- because he did something that they are not used to happening.  He repeated what he said he was going to do, and he's doing what he said he was going to do.  That's what was so refreshing about his speech today. And I believe that it wasn't just giving the people red meat, it was giving people what he said he was going to do, and liberals hated it and conservatives loved it!",1,381.0,75.0,guest,17.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
28,GUILFOYLE,"  All right.  Fantastic.  If it was me, I want some of that, you know, Godfather's pizza.  That was the good stuff, took, with pepperoni on it. So Matt, you're getting a lot of praise, like from my friend, Herman Cain. People really felt that this has gone incredibly well.  But what do you say to some of the naysayers that said, well, we would have liked to see that -- earlier on our show, on ""The Five,"" Juan Williams said, something that sounded more presidential, this sounds like it was just like the euphoria of a campaign.",1,531.0,98.0,guest,18.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
29,SCHLAPP,"  Yes, no.  I just don't know how it could go any better.  I'm actually thinking of resigning, Kimberly, because I don't think I could do any better than this.",1,159.0,30.0,guest,19.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24

31,SCHLAPP,"  Thank you, Herman, for your kind -- yes, for your kind, comments. Look, I think that's wrong.  I actually sat there and really watched and listened to the speech.  And it was a detailed explanation of what conservatives want to see happen from the federal government now.  And I thought it actually was very specific, and it hit really all the major points.",1,359.0,64.0,guest,21.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
32,GUILFOYLE,"  OK, you know, and yesterday, just give me a little bit about this kind of back and forth.  People were really curious to watch how it went down between Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus.  I'm sure you spoke to them beforehand and after they were on stage together.  How did it feel to you?  And were you worried at all about how it was going to come off?",1,354.0,69.0,guest,22.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
33,SCHLAPP,"  Yes, I was a little bit worried.  You know, clearly, there's all this talk about how maybe Reince and Steve don't get along, and we all decided the best thing would be to just put it out on stage and have a conversation. And beforehand -- you know, they got busy jobs.  They got a lot on my mind. But we actually got behind in the schedule, and we had time to talk and relax and laugh and talk about funny political moments.  And they were really loose by the time they got on stage. And I think people got a very candid assessment of their relationship, which is very constructive.  And I think the markets worldwide and I think the nation had a sigh of relief that these guys are working together and they're ready to get the job done.",1,739.0,142.0,guest,23.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
34,GUILFOYLE,"  Yes, so one team versus two different camps. You know, Herman, you were a strong supporter of President Trump from the beginning.  He's also been very strong here talking about jobs, the economy, trying to get to this back to the robustness that it once was. How did you feel today about his comments?",1,303.0,55.0,guest,24.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
35,CAIN,"  I felt inspired, and so did a lot of my listeners and people that I talk to.  They felt inspired.  And the comment that I continue to hear over and over and over -- he's actually saying what he said he was going to do--",1,221.0,46.0,guest,25.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
36,GUILFOYLE,  Exactly.,1,10.0,2.0,guest,26.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
37,CAIN,"  -- and he's doing it.  And the reason that a lot of the media people were not happy with the speech and he was criticized, as Matt said, about he didn't sound presidential -- the American people don't care about him sounding presidential.  They are concerned about him doing what he said he's going to do.  He doesn't speak in political speak.  He doesn't speak bureaucratic speak.  And he certainly doesn't speak media speak. He speaks Trump speak.  It connects with the American people.  They love it, and that's why the media and others don't like it because he's not saying the words that they want him to say.  Donald Trump, President Trump, is President Trump.  And that's what upsets them the most.",1,707.0,124.0,guest,27.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
38,GUILFOYLE,"  You know, it's interesting, Herman, because you've been right there in the thick of it and running for office.  And you see a lot of people trying to shape you or tell you what to say or how to dress or what to do in this whole process.",1,238.0,49.0,guest,28.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
39,CAIN,  Yes.,1,6.0,2.0,guest,29.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
40,GUILFOYLE,"  I mean, did you ever get a chance to give the president some advice, to say, you know, in terms of running a campaign and being very genuine and authentic with the people out there, the voters?",1,195.0,38.0,guest,30.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
41,CAIN,"  Yes.  President Trump was the only candidate -- not that they had to call me -- he was the only candidate that called me for advice before he ran in the primary.  And I gave him two pieces of advice.  Number one, be prepared for lawsuits because I didn't call it fake news then, but he's going to be hit with fake news and lies.  And that's what he's had to contend with. And the other thing that I suggested to him -- and he's carrying it out. Be true to yourself.  I had a plan called 9-9-9.  You know what I call his tax plan?  I called his tax plan cut, cut, cut.",1,569.0,115.0,guest,31.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24

43,CAIN,"  And you know what?  I'm happy with that because the American people can understand that.  And I believe that he's going to deliver on that.  He now has to work with the Congress, and he understands this, in order to be able to get it across the finish line.",1,259.0,50.0,guest,33.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
44,GUILFOYLE,"  All right.  And Matt, also, you had Lou Dobbs, one of our own, there today, and he's getting a lot of wide praise, you know, from a lot of the supporters of President Trump to say that he did a great job.  What do you think?",1,226.0,47.0,guest,34.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
45,SCHLAPP,"  Oh, Lou was great.  And we all know that Lou has -- Lou has this populist spirit and he takes no guff for anybody.  And to have them on before President Trump was just perfect.  And of course, we had Judge Jeanine Pirro, who really lit this place up.",1,252.0,50.0,guest,35.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24

56,EPSHTEYN,"  Well, the key topics we've been talking about, Kimberly, with you for a long time.  So nice to be here.  Through the campaign and the transition, and now the first five weeks, the unbelievably productive first five weeks -- national security, the economy, cutting taxes, cutting regulations and renewing that American promise, American spirit, and moving forward as a country to be more secure, to be more safe and be better off as a nation.",1,443.0,76.0,guest,46.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
57,GUILFOYLE,"  You know, there's a lot of things that the president set out to accomplish, and I just want to bring you back to yesterday, to Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus were on the stage together, talking about the agenda of the president, talking about the economic agenda that he wanted to be able to put forward. How do you think you guys, your team, is doing so far in terms of being able to put forward those ideas and sort of check the box on the promises that were made?  Steve Bannon was promising that, in fact, what the president promised during the campaign is, in fact, going to happen.  Do you think you're on track?",1,621.0,117.0,guest,47.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
58,EPSHTEYN,"  Oh, absolutely.  Look at the numbers first five weeks, over 35 meetings with foreign leaders, about 38 and growing.  And what is that? That is ensuring Americans' safety, American security, making sure people are safe in their homes, making sure they can walk their streets and not feel threatened. Over 25 presidential actions, just one today on cutting those job-stifling regulations.  Very important (INAUDIBLE) And as we move forward, you're going to be looking at activity, of course, on ObamaCare and on reforming that tax code.",1,536.0,87.0,guest,48.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
59,GUILFOYLE,"  All right, so you've been part of this team, you know, right from the beginning, part of the transition, et cetera.  You see a lot of discussion in social media, in the mainstream media, on the press, about on are there different factions or some warring interests within the administration.  You're right there.  Tell us.  Is it true or not?",1,344.0,61.0,guest,49.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
60,EPSHTEYN,"  No, there's no warring factions.  And you saw that in the discussion between Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus.  You are never going to get a group of sophisticated, achieved, smart people to agree off the bat on anything, on any -- and what you want is people to give their perspectives.  But the key is that when you make that decision, when the president decides what the action is, to carry that out as a cohesive unit. And that's exactly what's happening in this White House.",1,480.0,87.0,guest,50.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
61,GUILFOYLE,"  All right, well, you seem pretty optimistic about this.  Now let's talk a little bit about the breaking news today that happened, Boris.

And here with reaction are the founder and executive director of Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk, the author of ""The Deplorable's Guide to Making America Great Again,"" Todd Starnes, and Fox News senior correspondent Geraldo Rivera.  Gentlemen, thanks for being here tonight. Todd, I'm going to begin with you.  What did you think of the president's speech today?  I know you've had the opportunity to see him in person a lot before, and then you were able to watch this.  But did he hit all the right points?",2,602.0,103.0,guest,65.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24

88,,(LAUGHTER),2,,,,,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
89,STARNES,"  I thought it was amazing!  And one of the things that I really appreciated, the president picked up on a theme that's in my book, that this really is about the people that Hillary Clinton and the liberals and the mainstream media consider to be deplorable, those folks who want to secure the border, those folks who believe in traditional values.  And it was the word ""irredeemable"" that I think really struck a chord with folks because He Democrats believe that folks who believe like Donald Trump, folks who believe like the average American citizen, that their belief system is beyond redemption.  So I say thumbs up for the president.  He did a great job, and he had a home run today.",2,690.0,123.0,guest,67.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24

91,"GERALDO RIVERA, FOX CORRESPONDENT","  Well, I think that Todd mentioned Hillary Clinton.  I think Hillary Clinton was almost a shadow presence in that room.  Any time Donald Trump mentioned the fake media, he could have been saying Hillary Clinton.  It's like he had the old campaign speeches where Hillary -- even -- even to the point where the audience at CPAC began a chanting ""Lock her up"" when he never mentioned Hillary Clinton. His speech was so charismatic, so impassioned, it was so pointed, the barbs and so forth, only he was aiming the insults and the -- you know, the takedowns at the news media instead of Hillary Clinton.  But they heard it, the same tempo, really the same melody.  So they started shouting ""Lock her up.""  It was fascinating and entertaining.",2,739.0,130.0,guest,69.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
92,GUILFOYLE,"  OK, Charlie, how did you see it?",2,34.0,8.0,guest,70.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
93,"CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA","  You know, I boil it down to one word, and that's consistency.  You know, Donald Trump's been going here for six years now, and every single year, he has kept this theme the same. We're going to put America first.  We're going to put people back to work. You know, what's so incredible is we finally have a president of the United States who now is doing what he said he was going to do, and he's been saying it for a while.  You know, for people that aren't familiar with this conference, CPAC's like the Super Bowl of conservative politics.  You know, we brought hundreds of young students here.  And every single year, year after year, they got to hear Donald Trump talk about putting America first. And today, you know, it was like a conversation with friends.  He was talking amongst people that put him in the office. This is the baseline, the base of the grass roots across the country.  I thought it was very, very well received.  What's so amazing is he's not saying anything new.  He is consistent in his love for America and his message back to the people that helped them get there.",2,1095.0,201.0,guest,71.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
94,GUILFOYLE,"  (INAUDIBLE) some strong messaging yesterday, Geraldo, as well. You comment on that, but I also want you to touch on Steve Bannon, essentially, a call to arms, saying if you think that the media is going to give the country back without a fight, you are sadly mistaken.",2,270.0,49.0,guest,72.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
95,RIVERA,"  Well, that's -- that's terrific, Bannon.  But I just wanted to point out, to CPAC, lest we rewrite history, Donald Trump came in third in the straw poll at CPAC, losing to Ted Cruz and to Marco Rubio.  And as I recall, he postponed last year's speech for fear that it would not to be well received during the heat of the campaign. So victory is an amazing tonight.  You know, now he is triumphant.  Now he has saved the Republican Party and brought it to unprecedented extraordinary power.  But just a year ago, he was a candidate that would have been an also-run in that very tough crowed there in CPAC. In terms of Bannon and Reince Priebus -- you know, it was terrific to see Bannon even speaking.  I've never seen him speak before.  His image of the Grim Reaper from ""Saturday Night Live"" is the only image of him I had.  It was terrific to see him, terrific to see the political and the -- you know, the ideological forces inside the White House shoulder to shoulder and making a compelling argument, a powerful argument.  They are a formidable duo.  There's doubt about it.  And Trump has harnessed these twin tornadoes.",2,1128.0,205.0,guest,73.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
96,GUILFOYLE,"  Yes, it's interesting.  You know, a lot of discussion about it in the press, you know, for now, you know, months, about two different factions, first in the campaign, then in the transition, now they're saying in the administration, Todd.  Did you feel that yesterday's appearance, the two of them on stage -- - do you think it quieted that storm?",2,349.0,62.0,guest,74.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24
97,STARNES,"  You know, I think it did for just a little while.  But again, I think right now, conservatives are very happy with the fact that President Trump is delivering on those campaign promises. I do want to take him to task for one thing, calling the mainstream media, parts of the mainstream media ""fake news.""  I think we ought to call them what they are.  They're liars who are attempting to take down a duly elected president.  We ought to call them out on it, and I'm glad the president is doing that.  But they're not fakers, they're lying, and they need to be held accountable.",2,579.0,107.0,guest,75.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24

99,KIRK,"  No, I completely agree.  And to the response to Geraldo -- you know, look, Donald Trump has been coming year after year after year.  And my point is he's won over these conservative activists year after year--",2,211.0,38.0,guest,77.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24

101,KIRK,"  -- with a consistent message.  And so -- but you -- I think it really deserves, you know, appreciation that he hasn't just tried to pander to this crowd on a strict, you know, 10-point conservative doctrine.  He says, We're going to put America first.  We're going to be consistent.  So that's what I meant by that. And finally, you got to love the enthusiasm and the energy for a president of the United States.  And you can see the conservative activists that were here at CPAC -- we've been waiting for this for a long time, and it was truly an amazing moment.",2,565.0,105.0,guest,79.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-02-24

22,HANNITY," Really, Nancy? You couldn't stand or clap for creating jobs? Now, it just shows how much influence the alt-radical left now has over the Democratic Party, and more importantly, that the Democrats have zero interest in working with President Trump, even though he's trying to clean up the mess that they left from their failed leftist policies. Now, that means the responsibility now to fix the country falls squarely on the shoulders of the Republicans in the House and the Senate. Now is the time they've got to lead. Now, just take a look at the reaction to last night's speech from the American public.

5,HANNITY," Now, Attorney General Sessions said the decision was reached over a matter of weeks and not a reaction to a Washington Post story that was published late last night with the headline, ""Sessions met with Russian envoy twice last year, encounters he (ph) did not disclose."" Now, The Washington Post is claiming that last year, while serving as a U.S. senator, that Jeff Sessions met with the Russian ambassador twice and then lied to Congress about this during his confirmation hearings. Now, in his capacity as a senator, Jeff Sessions was a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. So it was not out of the ordinary that he talked to foreign ambassadors because, as a matter of fact, he spoke to dozens and dozens of them last year alone. He was doing his job. And that's not at all. Then there's this ridiculous notion that the alt-radical left is pushing that Attorney General Sessions committed perjury, he lied under oath during his confirmation hearing. Now, watch and listen very closely to this exchange that they're referring to between liberal Democratic Senator Al ""Frankenstein"" and then-Senator Sessions.",1,1130.0,189.0,host,4.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-02

AL FRANKEN, D-MINN."," CNN has just published a story -- and I'm telling you this about a new story that's just been published, so I'm not expecting you to know whether or not it's true or not. But CNN just published a story alleging that the intelligence community provided documents to the president-elect last week that included information that, quote, ""Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump."" These documents also allegedly stated, quote, ""There was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government."" Now, again, I'm telling you this as it's coming out, so -- you know. But if it's true, it's obviously extremely serious.

10,HANNITY," He was responding to that question, that, quote, ""breaking news,"" which, by the way, turned out to not be true. Now, that's what the Democrats are hyperventilating about, losing their minds over? Yes, Jeff Sessions as a senator met with the Russian ambassador, but he did so in that capacity, not on behalf of the Trump campaign, which is why when he was asked specifically about the election, he said, ""No, that wasn't me.  The charge, that wasn't me."" And by the way, where was the hysteria from Democrats back during the campaign -- remember Bill Clinton met with the former attorney general, Loretta Lynch, in a plane on a tarmac for over 30 minutes while Hillary Clinton was under investigation by the FBI, by the Justice Department?  Lynch never recused herself. But unlike Loretta Lynch, Jeff Sessions, well, clearly wanted to reassure you, the American people, that all Russia investigations will be free of any political interference. And now the latest thing is, well, Jared Kushner and Lieutenant General Mike Flynn, they met with the Russian ambassador in December after the president won. So this whole smear campaign is really just part of the Democrats' larger fake news conspiracy theory that Russian hacking -- hacking's all the reason why Hillary Clinton lost the election, and that somehow, members of the Trump campaign secretly coordinated the whole thing. Now, they've been pushing this ever since Donald Trump won the presidency. But back in January, James Clapper, President Obama's own director of national intelligence, said Russian interference did not impact vote tallies, period. And earlier today, the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said there's zero evidence the Trump campaign ever coordinated with Russia.",1,1739.0,284.0,host,7.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-02

But the alt-left propaganda media and the Democrats for months have been going ballistic over the Russian election influence, without any evidence. They never told you the truth, by the way, about President Obama and his own foreign election interference. Now, when I talk about Israel, a congressional investigation found back in 2014, an Israeli political group used $300,000 of Obama State Department grant money -- your tax dollars -- to create a political apparatus to defeat the Israeli prime minister.

Everything was going well. And surprise, surprise, The Washington Post and The New York Times coming up with another fake news story that has no meaning. And they are shocked to discover, for example, that the Russian ambassador was one of 30 people -- to their credit, even The Post downplayed this and recognized that it was so stupid, it was embarrassing. There were apparently, like, 30 ambassadors who come up to congratulate Sessions at the Republican national convention, at a Heritage Foundation reception. They were all just standing around, talking. And this is supposed to be the big meeting? The other thing was, he was very clear. Franken asked him about campaign activities. He said, I never discussed them with the Russians. It turned out the Russian ambassador came by to the U.S. Senate office in his role as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and is one of, I think, 46 ambassadors that he's met with. But here's what I'm intrigued with, Sean. I watched the press conference.  He said, I asked my team to advise me. They told me I should recuse myself. I am following their advice. I'm going to make sure this is all clear. It was pointed out to him that the president had said maybe he shouldn't, and he proved his independence. He did what he thought was right, not what he thought the White House wanted. Now, I want to see how The New York Times and The Washington Post spin this.

89,RYAN," We told America here's our vision for how we replace ObamaCare after we repeal ObamaCare. That is the bill we are working on right now, and I am perfectly confident then when it is all said and done, we're going to unify because we all, every Republican ran on repealing and replacing, and we are going to keep our promises.",3,325.0,61.0,guest,67.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-02

91,HANNITY," On this program we have promised you that we will hold Washington and the Republicans accountable to their promises. And tonight that is exactly what we are going to do. And we continue with former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. So Senator Rand Paul today says that the bill that the speaker is talking about is locked up. Nobody has an opportunity to read it. I talked to him earlier today and he said it is locked up because there are things in there like the Cadillac tax that is being renamed, and a mandate that remains, and that he and other conservatives and the House, the freedom caucus in the House, are against. What is your reaction?",3,651.0,120.0,host,68.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-02
92,GINGRICH," I don't think we will know until we see it. But the legislative process takes a long time. Even if you're fast it takes a pretty long time. So they may have staff working on the bill right now. It may be in seclusion in effect for right now.  But it's going to become public. And the minute it becomes public, it's going to be on the internet and you are going to have thousands of experts and lobbyists and others analyzing it within minutes. If they are really dumb things in the bill, they will be obvious in the first 24 hours. Then they will have to go through an amending process. I have great respect for Speaker Ryan. He and I have both held that job, and it's a tough job. But in the end, he serves his conference, and I think if there are some things in there that are unacceptable, my guess is they will be taking out.",3,830.0,163.0,guest,69.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-02
93,HANNITY," It seems like there is a communication, when I talk to the Freedom Caucus members or Senator Paul, they are assuming that these things are in there or they believed that they are in there, and nobody is talking to each other. Why not let us see the bill now? Why if it's being scored?",3,285.0,56.0,host,70.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-02
94,GINGRICH," I think frankly the bill is probably not complete. I think they're looking at it, fixing it, looking at things to that don't fit, don't quite work. But the fact is sooner or later it's going to go to I think primarily the Ways and Means Committee in the House but also potentially to Energy and Commerce depending on how they have shaped the bill. Ultimately it's going to go to the Senate. None of this stuff is going to happen overnight. And I certainly don't believe that the Republican leadership is going to do what Nancy Pelosi tried to do and Harry Reid tried to do with ObamaCare. It would be a disaster to try to ram through something without having it out in the open, without making it amendable, without any chance to talk it through. Nobody is smart enough to fix 20 percent of the American economy, a matter of life and death for every American, in secret. So sooner or later it's going to become public. But I also think what Speaker Paul Ryan said is absolutely true. Tom Price, the new secretary of Health and Human Services, a medical doctor, spent years as a member of Congress working on this variation as chairman of the budget committee. Well, so they have got a guy in Health and Human Services who understands how to work with House Republicans. He is very acceptable to the Senate Republicans. They're going to have to talk all the stuff through. And, frankly, there will be a lot of tension. I have no doubt that there will be amendments offered and that some of those amendments will pass.  But that is the legislative process. That is how America is supposed to operate.",3,1599.0,292.0,guest,71.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-02
95,HANNITY," You make me feel better when you say -- you said the other night, you put it in a box. What do you need to get the bill passed, what do you need? I understand it's like making sausage, it's complicated. It's also important, though, I think one of the things that Americans like the most about the president and why his popularity is soaring and why people are coalescing around his agenda is because he is keeping his promises. And I think it's so important on every one of these issues they don't really have a lot of time, even though they have both houses of Congress, do they?  There is a period of time next year when we begin on the election cycle again. Am I wrong?",3,673.0,130.0,host,72.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-02

101,GINGRICH," We passed welfare reform in the summer of an election year. And it got vetoed twice. We passed it three times. It got signed the third time. Here is a very simple question. When people thoroughly understand this bill, do they think it is better for them? If the bill is better for them, I don't care whether it is the month before the election. It's going to be hard to stop it. If they think the bill is worse for them, you're going to create a new Tea Party movement. So I don't have an artificial deadline.  I think Speaker Ryan has said with great sincerity that he hopes to get everything done in 200 days.",3,612.0,118.0,guest,77.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-02

They are going to say, well, that's great. How are you going to sell cars? Well, snipers, some of the skills they have, the operational planning, they are so meticulous with what they do. And you talk to any sniper in the world, they will say they are better at math than half the people I know and probably more so.

And so you've heard both presidents after my time say we're going to degrade and defeat ISIS.  And I say, Go get them, because they can be degraded and defeated.  And it's very important, in my mind, that we do so so that people know they can rely upon us, and the people -- not only governments but people on the ground, people who want to be free. And you ask some of these troops, you know, were you able to see human deprivation and improvement?  And they say yes.  I mean, one of the -- a lot of them say to me, you know, I love the idea that girls being able to go to school for the first time in Afghanistan or young kids in Iraq being no longer subjected to the thuggery of these ideological, you know, thugs.",1,1087.0,212.0,guest,44.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-03

That July in the Korngal (ph) valley, John's unit came under fire from both sides of a river.  They took heavy casualties in the ambush.  John was targeted while trying to recover the body of his company commander.  ""I was shot by a PKM machine gun multiple times in the right upper thigh,"" he recounts, ""basically cutting my leg in half."" For the next three years, John fought to keep his leg.  Eventually, with support from his wife, Sarah, and doctors, he made the excruciating decision to amputate.  Looking back on it, John considers it the best decision of his life.  It freed him to begin began his recovery in full and start running, climbing, and playing golf again.",2,984.0,178.0,guest,114.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-03

210,BUSH,"  Spencer Milo joined the military in 2006 as an airborne infantryman. In 2008, he sustained injuries in Iraq that led to the discovery of a tumor in his brain.  The prognosis was not good.  He was given six months to live. Fortunately, that diagnosis was wrong.  The tumor was removed, giving Spencer a new lease on life.  He chose to use it to continue serving in the United States Army.  Spencer embarked on his second combat deployment, this time to Afghanistan.  In January 2011, he was injured again and in a horrifying way.  A child suicide bomber detonated eight feet from Spencer. The experts at NICO (ph) helped Spencer rehabilitate with the therapies that worked best for him.  Mountain biking was effective.  Getting off the prescriptions helped a lot, and the family was at the top of the list. ""When I found out that my wife was pregnant with my daughter, I remember an emotion I had overseas.  In order to take care of others, you have to be able to take care of yourself.  It gave me a new and reinvigorated motivator to get better and allow myself to heal.",3,1073.0,192.0,guest,193.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-03

0,"SEAN HANNITY, HOST"," And welcome to ""Hannity."" ""The Great One,"" a rare appearance, Mark Levin -- he'll be here in just a minute. But first, it's time to cut through all the clutter, break down what we know about wiretapping and politically motivated investigation by the Obama administration. And that is tonight's ""Opening Monologue."" All right, so over the weekend, President Donald Trump set off a firestorm and he tweeted the following, quote, ""How low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election process? This (ph) Nixon, Watergate, bad or sick guy."" Now, predictably, the left, Democrats, their cronies at the alt left propaganda destroy Trump media, they went into full-on meltdown mode and declared the president to be a liar once again. Now, there's also been some pushback from the FBI Director James Comey.  We'll get to that in a minute. And now for weeks on this program, on my radio show, I've been discussing what? What I call Obama's shadow government and the career bureaucrats who are actively working against President Trump from inside the government.  Many of these are people that are President Obama holdovers, and I've been telling you about we the people, that there are other people in the intelligence community purposely leaking information to try and damage and destroy President Trump and the advisers, of course, that surround him. One by one, every adviser, they have been smeared. They have been slandered. They have been besmirched, even his children, even his wife and daughter. We've also been reporting on how the alt-left propaganda destroy Trump media is colluding with these leakers and deep state bureaucrats with the sole purpose of stopping President Trump's agenda, to try and delegitimize the president with the hopes of eventually removing the president from power, overturning a free election. Now, is this a conspiracy theory, paranoia? No. Why? There's a disturbing pattern that's going on here. Now, let's take a look at the case of former Trump national security adviser, that's retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. Remember news reports, a December call Flynn made to the Russian ambassador, captured by what The New York Times described as a, quote, ""routine wiretap"" of Russian diplomats and that phone? Well, now, it's not out of the ordinary, by the way, of our government to monitor foreign officials. That's the smart thing they do. But protections which are known as minimization procedures have been put in place to protect Americans that are not under warrant, American citizens that are caught up in their surveillance. And by the way, that their identities are protected, their constitutional rights are to be protected. Now, this, of course, was not the case with Lieutenant General Flynn because we know a transcript of his call was created and then given to intelligence officials, who then leaked this information, which is a felony, to the press that printed it. Now, back in February, when all this was going down, the House Intelligence Committee chairman -- and that's Congressman Devin Nunes -- he called it, quote, ""unprecedented,"" and then he joined us on this show to explain.  Let's take a look.",1,3186.0,525.0,host,1.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06

2,HANNITY," Isn't this the type of thing where if you have a rogue -- if you have rogue intelligence people and they're intercepting, illegally intercepting phone calls of Americans, that's illegal. And this -- in other words, if, in fact, they wanted to get the intel, or for example, hack into the phone of, in this particular case, General Flynn, wouldn't they have to get a court subpoena to do so?",1,391.0,71.0,host,2.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06
3,"REP. DEVIN NUNES, R-CALIF."," That's correct. And I am not aware that they did that. So my guess is, is that the intelligence agencies did not do this. What I'm assuming is, is that this was picked up as they were tracking someone else. And if that's the case, that would have had to go up to the highest levels of the Obama administration to get approval to unmask who that person is, and in this case, it was General Flynn.",1,396.0,78.0,guest,3.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06
4,,(END VIDEO CLIP),1,,,,,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06
5,HANNITY," Now, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Now, Fox News has not been able to confirm this, but the day before the election, November 7th, 2016, the website HeatStreet, they published a report. It had the following headline. Quote, ""Exclusive, FBI granted FISA warrant covering Trump camp's ties to Russia."" And according to HeatStreet, in October of 2016, the Obama administration went to the FISA court, which grants warrants for surveillance for potential spies or terrorists to monitor, which HeatStreet described as, quote, ""U.S. persons in Donald Trump's campaign with ties to Russia."" Now, this was part of a larger probe into Russian banks. Now, other outlets like the BBC, The Guardian have also reported that a FISA court warrant was, in fact, granted. And this is not an isolated incident, either. There are countless examples of various federal agencies under President Obama looking into activities of intercepting communications with people associated with the Trump campaign. For example, McClatchy D.C. posted a story back in January, headline, quote, ""FBI, five other agencies probe possible covert Kremlin aid to Trump."" On the day of the inauguration, January 20th, the front page of The New York Times ran an article with this headline -- ""Wiretap data used in inquiry of Trump aides."" There's also explosive reports from The Times, the-alt left propaganda destroy Trump at all costs media has given very little coverage to. In other words, it's not the right-wing conspiracy, it's them. It reads in part, quote, ""In its final days, the Obama administration expanded the power of the National Security Agency to share globally intercepted personal communications with the government's 16 other intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections."" Now, why would President Obama wait until the last minute, two weeks before he's leaving office, the issue that order, an order that did not apply to him for eight years? To me, the opinion is obvious. He wanted as much information, whether it's true or not, to be available to his appointed deep state shadow government officials so they could do exactly what we're seeing -- leak it to the press and try and hurt the president with less likelihood that they're going to get caught. Now, listen closely as I read the statement that was released by Obama's spokesperson over the weekend. Pay very close attention. ""A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever"" -- key words -- ""ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false."" OK, they didn't order it. Did they know about it? That statement never said that President Obama did not know about it, just that he didn't order it. Even President Obama's former speech writer noted this on Twitter this past weekend. Now, the question that we need answered is very simple and very basic, and it's this: Did, in fact, the president of the United States -- what did he know and when did he know it? In other words, did the president have any answers about surveillance of an opposition candidate in the middle of an election? Now, the American people deserve the truth, but he doesn't have much credibility on the issue. Why? Because his administration wiretapped the phone of our own colleague, James Rosen! There's also former Attorney General Michael Mukasey who knows a thing or two about this entire process.  Here's what he said.",1,3589.0,593.0,host,4.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06

7,"MICHAEL MUKASEY, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL"," This is the difference between being correct and being right. I think the president was not correct, certainly, in saying that President Obama ordered a tap on a server in Trump Tower. However, I think he's right in that there was surveillance and that it was conducted at the behest of the attorney -- of the Justice Department through the FISA court.",1,353.0,63.0,guest,5.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06

9,MUKASEY," I based that on news reports that you mentioned in the last -- in the last spot. I also base it on -- on the kind of inadvertent blurting out by Adam Schiff that his committee wants to talk to the counterintelligence agents at the FBI who were involved in this. Now, what that means is that this is part not of a criminal investigation but of an intelligence-gathering investigation.",1,384.0,71.0,guest,7.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06

11,HANNITY," Boy, didn't she cry the night of election night? All right, we'll put that aside. All right, on top of all this, there's a bunch of other questions that need answers. What did President Obama know about these reported, New York Times-reported FISA requests targeting associates of then candidate Donald Trump? Now, to me, what happened to retired Lieutenant General Flynn and what we are now seeing with all these other intelligent (sic) leaks -- this is a canary in a coal mine. This accusation that President Trump made is serious. We need to get to the bottom of what the truth is and where all of this came from and who knew what, when and where. Here now with reaction, from LevinTV's studio in Virginia, the host of LevinTV CRTV network -- I call him ""The Great One."" Do you know what it's like to get you on the show?

This isn't conservative Sean Hannity, conservative Mark Levin. This is The New York Times. This is McClatchy. Explain.",1,315.0,57.0,host,12.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06
16,LEVIN," And yet it's only conservatives who are concerned about what they're reading in liberal media. Have you noticed that? The media is very confounded right now. They're very confused. They don't know whether to trash themselves, trash their colleagues, or what. Now, you asked a question. You said, what did Obama know? We know he knows this much. Everything you just read he knew because it's in the newspapers. That's pretty big. Number two, we know that if a FISA warrant was secured, it's very likely in his daily intelligence briefing or a call from the attorney general or the director of the FBI the president would be given a heads-up. There's nothing illegal about it, but he'd be given a heads-up. Here's what else we know. There's all kinds of, based on these reports, investigative activities going on. You know, McClatchy reported the agencies involved, the FBI, CIA, National Security Agency, Justice Department, Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network -- I assume Obama knew something unless, I mean, he's Helen Keller! Let me make another point about this. That's a hell of a lot of agency resources. Those are a hell of a lot of investigators.

24,LEVIN," But let me comment. It's very, very important. It's very important because if Clapper says there was no FISA order -- and he was very broad and he was very definite, and he said, No, I don't remember this, and you'll play it later -- then what the hell are we talking about?  That means they didn't have enough information for probable cause to get a warrant in front of the FISA court! So what's the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Justice Department, Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network investigating? What are these wiretaps that The New York Times is talking about? You know, I know they want to focus on Donald Trump and his tweet.  I want to focus on America and the Constitution! The reason I got fed up with this last week is I'm a constitutional conservative. I look at this, if I'm reading these news reports, we have a runaway executive branch! I don't know who knows what, and as of today, the media don't appear to know who knows what, which is exactly why I've been calling for congressional investigations. The question is, why aren't CNN, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and all the rest of them - - why aren't they concerned about this?",1,1177.0,212.0,guest,18.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06

27,HANNITY," So what you're saying is really deep and profound here. And I want to put some emphasis on this. And that is that the news media reported the leaks. The news media reported the surveillance. They reported it repeatedly. This is the a mainstream media. As far as I know, they've never retracted the story. And everybody knew about it. It was not something that was hidden. Now, in fact, Donald Trump mentions that, in fact, it happened and somehow, this is, Oh, my gosh, this is outrageous.

30,LEVIN," Well, two things need to happen, one way or another. Number one, the FISA applications, which Clapper denies, by the way -- he denies, and the follow-up was pathetic over there on NBC, but we'll get to that. The FISA applications should be released. That's number one. The warrant that was supposedly secured in October should be released. The other thing that needs to be done is these daily presidential briefings that the president received, that the intelligence and law enforcement agencies coordinate on and prepare -- the Intelligence Committee chairmen need to read them. And now we'll get to the bottom of this. Now, I find it very interesting people are saying, Well, let Trump release the damn FISA stuff! Can you imagine if he does that? He'd be accused of interfering with investigations, trying to intimidate the Justice Department. No. Let Congress finally step up and do its job! They have oversight committees.

And I think the most telling aspect of this, Sean, is something you and I talked about several times, and that is 17 days before President Obama leaves office -- 17 days before he leaves office, he had been in office for eight full years, he changes the way in which signal intel is distributed. Since the Reagan era it used to just go to the NSA. They would decide where the raw data would go. And he changed it with 17 days left so that 17 additional agencies get it, which of course makes a much more difficult to determine who is engaged in the leaks.

And earlier tonight the House GOP released their plan to do just that. On this program we have been pushing a brand- new replacement plan, and we pledge to hold Washington and Republicans accountable. And that is what we are doing again tonight. Here now are two members of the Freedom Caucus, Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert and North Carolina Congressman Mark Meadows. I know that Jim Jordan and Dave Brat have been critical of the Bill. It's 123 pages. I got an outline of these things. I think the first thing we have got to say is this bill is going to have amendments, correct. So we all agree that this bill is going to change.

157,MEADOWS," Exactly. But we don't really get rid of the Cadillac tax all together. It is still in there. It just comes back in eight years. And so we really need to look at some amendments to make sure that we get rid of the taxes. We put something on President Obama's desk just a few months ago, and to suggest that what we put on President Trump's desk sets a new entitlement, keeps some taxes, doesn't repeal all of ObamaCare, we have got to do better, and hopefully with some amendments we can do that.",4,496.0,96.0,guest,132.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06
158,HANNITY," Let me ask you specifically about it doesn't repeal it completely, because I asked a lot of people about this today, and some people are saying they should pass the 2015 bill which would be a complete repeal, and then come in with a replacement. And then they say because they're using reconciliation which is the means by which it was passed, they have to do it because you only need 51 votes in the Senate versus 60.  Any merit to that argument?",4,448.0,84.0,host,133.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06
159,MEADOWS," Certainly when you look at the reconciliation process and you look at 51 votes, that is one of the hurdles that we have. This doesn't even go as far as we went in 2015 to repeal all the Medicaid expansion.  It's still keeps that. So as we are looking at that we've got to find that sweet spot. One of the concerns I have, the biggest concern I have, will it lower health care costs and premiums to those people that I serve and that Louie serves, and really to the Americans that are watching tonight? Will it lower health care costs, and until we get that answer, we have got to hold that judgment.",4,600.0,116.0,guest,134.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06
160,HANNITY," Louie, health savings accounts are a part of it. There are also, there is this guy in Wichita, Kansas, that I often have on my radio, Josh Umbehr with Atlas Medical. He created a cooperative in his city where you get all the medical care, unlimited, 50 bucks a month as an adult, 10 bucks a month as a child. He negotiates directly with pharmaceutical companies.  He brings 90 percent of the costs go away. And a lot of things have happened. There are good things in this bill. For example, they're blocking funds for abortion providers, Planned Parenthood, for example. You are upset with what parts?",4,602.0,108.0,host,135.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06
161,GOHMERT," Well, like Mark mentioned, we left the Cadillac tax in there. It just comes back. But then it creates a new entitlement program. And I have already hear from some constituents upset about you are creating another entitlement program? We are calling it tax credits that we actually send people check. And I guess it's another way to do the subsidy. But another concern --",4,371.0,66.0,guest,136.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06
162,HANNITY, So what would be the antidote to that? What would you prefer?,4,62.0,13.0,host,137.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06
163,GOHMERT," I would prefer that we bring the prices down adequately so that more people can get health insurance. But you know, you talk about these entrepreneurial ways of getting insurance. If we don't repeal the care in Ferguson exemption from anti-trust, then these brilliant entrepreneurial other news plans, they are going to be shut out. We have got to get that done and it needs to be done separately. But another thing, we are going to force citizens, it looks like, to end up paying for people's health care that are illegally here.

165,MEADOWS," Sean, we really do need to look at the safety net. And when we are there, when we're really looking at the Medicaid expansion part of it, we have got to make sure that we're there. This goes beyond that. And I think the other aspect of that, you mentioned health savings accounts. One of the amendments I hope that the president supports and certainly that we'll be offering is really to expand the use of health savings account like Dr. Rand Paul has talked about.",4,466.0,87.0,guest,140.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06

170,MEADOWS," Any of these, Sean, that go into it actually can't go to funding health savings account. They actually have to go to purchase insurance.  If you have that flexibility where you can actually put it in a health savings account, actually patients have more control over their doctors, then ultimately it helps.",4,308.0,53.0,guest,145.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-06

0,SEAN HANNITY," It's time to break down the GOP's American Health Care Act and determine whether it is really is going to work for you, the American people.  It's time to hold Washington accountable, and that is tonight's 'Opening Monologue.' Let's go back to 2009. Then President Obama told a room full of lawmakers that, quote, 'Elections have consequences.' Well, eight years later, with the Republicans now in control of the House, the Senate and the executive branch, Obama's crowning achievement is officially on the chopping block. Some on the right, many conservatives, are slamming the bill, including Americans for Prosperity, the Club for Growth, the Heritage Action Committee and many others, including author Daniel Horowitz. He released an article titled 'RINOcare, a more insolvent version of ObamaCare, except this time, the GOP owns it.' Some congressional Republicans are also raising very serious issues. Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MIKE LEE, R-UTAH: What's been introduced in the last 24 hours is not the ObamaCare replacement plan, not the ObamaCare repeal plan we've been hoping for. This is instead a step in the wrong direction. REP. LOUIE GOHMERT, R-TEXAS: There better not be a rule that prevents amendments that are badly needed to fix this flawed bill. REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: Obviously, we have some serious concerns. We haven't been shy about the serious concerns as we look at that. And yet with any negotiation, you look at the tradeoffs. What are the risks versus the rewards? SEN. RAND PAUL, R-K.Y., FMR. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The House bill's been put forward is 'ObamaCare lite.' It won't work. Premiums and prices will continue to spiral out of control. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Is the American Health Care Act 'ObamaCare lite'? Before we get to that, let's take a step back. Let's look at some positive aspects that are in this plan. After seven years of promising to repeal ObamaCare, Republicans are attempting to do just that. That's a good thing. By eliminating the individual and employer mandates -- that's a good thing. Also, this bill strips federal funding for abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. That's a promise the president made on the campaign trail. It also eliminates the medical device tax, as well as other oppressive taxes enacted under ObamaCare. But -- and a big 'but' tonight. While the American Health Care Act is a step in the right direction, it is far from perfect. It must be fixed. ObamaCare must be under all circumstances completely repealed. We have rising premium costs, they must be addressed further. And certain types of insurance free cooperatives need to be utilized, as long as -- as well as health care savings accounts, which we will explore in just a minute. Before the GOP -- I'm warning everybody on both sides of this debate. Until they erupt into massive infighting, it's very important to note these words from the Health and Human Services secretary, who will join us later, Tom Price. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TOM PRICE, HHS SECRETARY: This is a work in progress, and we'll work with the House and the Senate in this process. As you know, it's a legislative process that occurs. You start at a starting point. People engage and they get involved in the process, sometimes to a greater degree. Nothing focuses the mind like a bill that's currently on the table and that has -- has a -- is a work in progress, or in process. And we'll work through it. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: It's very important the Freedom Caucus and the Study Group in the House and people like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and Mike Lee be listened to and that their contributions added to this bill. So Secretary Price is right. And tonight, I want to put an end to the civil war that seems to be brewing inside the Republican Party. The current version of the American Health Care Act, as Tom Price said, is a first draft. First drafts are never perfect, always filled with errors, miscalculations. It's up to Republican members of Congress to come together and fix this bill and get it right for you, the American people, all while putting together a unified strategy to combat efforts from Democrats to paint the bill as a disaster for low-income Americans. In other words, Republicans want to kill children and kill old people. These cannot take place, these discussions on TV or in the press. My suggestion tonight is Republicans, that includes the Freedom Caucus, that includes the senators I mentioned, and that includes others, should get together in a room, work through these issues in person, the House Freedom Caucus, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Marco Rubio, other conservatives who have been loudly voicing their concerns for eight years, and sadly, many of these ideas were not represented in this bill. Once ObamaCare is repealed and replaced, Republicans, you are going to own what's in this. And those who voted to put you in control of Congress will not settle for 'ObamaCare lite,' myself included. Congress, remember, your jobs are on the line here. But more importantly, so are the lives and the well-being of millions of Americans. You got to get this right and you've got to join forces. Frankly, it would have been better if a consensus bill was built before it was released. But with that being said, you still have time to fix it, and I hope you do. Joining me now is a doctor who all members of Congress, I believe, should get to know. He founded what's called Atlas MD, a health care cooperative. It's in Wichita, Kansas, that is in insurance-free. Dr. Josh Umbehr is with us, as well as family physician Dr. Ryan Neuhofel. Guys, welcome to the program.

5,UMBEHR," Absolutely. And thanks for being the leader in having this conversation about real solutions that could be enacted to help Americans. The idea is direct primary care, which is the new model going forward, where we don't take insurance because we don't need insurance for the common things. Our care is $10 a month for kids, $50 a month for most adults for unlimited visits, no co-pays, free office procedures and up to95 percent savings on medications, labs, imaging, et cetera, by going wholesale. We're able to take that full value, go back to an employer, decrease their insurance premiums by 30 to 60 percent in the first year.

And I had interviewed you a long time ago about your specific plan. And I guess what is so kind of shocking to me is that all these criticisms were out there by conservatives before the bill was introduced. Why wasn't there a meeting and a consensus built on the bill within the Republican Party before it was released?",2,529.0,97.0,host,29.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07
36,PRICE," Well, it was released by the House, as you know. But we've been working with members of the Senate, members of the House, stakeholders all across the land about this piece of legislation. And I think we've gotten to a pretty sweet spot. Now, there -- this is a work in progress and continues to be so. But the core is that ObamaCare has failed, as you well know. We got costs that are going up. The access is going down. It's only getting worse. You got insurers pulling out of the market. Premiums are going up. Deductibles are skyrocketing. So people aren't getting care or coverage right now in the individual and small group market.",2,637.0,117.0,guest,30.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07

And one of the things one of the Freedom Caucus members told me today is they would rather block grant any money for the uninsured or the poor back to the states. Would that be something you'd be open to?",2,333.0,66.0,host,35.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07
42,PRICE," Well, we're talking about tactics, and that thing. But let me make clear to people that this -- this single bill is not the entire plan. There are three different phases. One is this bill that has to go through reconciliation because it's a budgetary process. Two is all of the kinds of rules and regulations. You remember all the things that the previous administration did, hundreds of rules, thousands, literally thousands of guidance letters. We're going to go through every single one of them to determine whether or not they help patients or hurt patients. And if they hurt patients, we're going to do our best to get rid of them. And then the third phase is another piece of legislation that can't be done through reconciliation because of the specific rules. Those are the kinds of things that we're going to do in those phase two and three, to purchase across state lines, to put in lawsuit abuse reform, expand HSAs in a more vibrant way, all the things that we know will actually bring down costs and allow individuals to get the coverage that they want for themselves and for their families.",2,1104.0,196.0,guest,36.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07
43,HANNITY," I guess because a lot of people thought the 123-page bill was the bill, and I guess that's the reason. Mr. Secretary, let me ask this question because one of the things that some conservatives are asking -- and I think it's a fair question. They -- every Republican voted for a repeal bill in and of itself in 2015. Why not do that again so you ensure all of it is gone? Is that possible?",2,389.0,77.0,host,37.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07

If you get your coverage through your employer, which is about 175 million people in this country, you get a tax benefit because you're -- that's paid with pre-tax dollars. The individuals that are out there in the individual and small group market, they don't have any tax benefits.

71,HANNITY," Welcome back to 'Hannity.' The alt-left propaganda destroy Trump media and the Democrats -- they're now smearing the commander-in-chief while flat-out refusing to ask President Barack Obama very critical questions about wiretapping. And that is tonight's 'mini- monologue.' The left is breathlessly saying that the president isn't telling the truth over wiretapping allegations. Take a look at some of the headlines from The New York Times, CNN, The Washington Post smearing the president. 'Trump offering no evidence says Obama tapped his phones,' 'Trump's baseless wiretap claim' and 'Trump citing no evidence accuses Obama of Nixon Watergate plot to wiretap Trump Tower.' The hypocrisy is stunning! Why? The New York Times is accusing the president of lying, but they are the ones that printed this headline on the front page of their paper of all days January 20th. Wiretap data used in inquiry of Trump aides. If you read the article, it says in part, quote, 'The FBI is leading the investigations aided by the National Security Agency, the CIA and the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Unit.' 'Now, the investigators have accelerated their efforts in recent weeks but have found no conclusive evidence of wrongdoing, the official said. One official said intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House.' The New York Times reported on wiretapped communications that got to the White House. But somehow, President Trump -- he's the one who's lying? This is ridiculous and it proves exactly why you, the American people, do not trust the media. There's also the ridiculous statement from President Barack Obama's spokesman. 'A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered'-- keyword -- 'ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false. ' The statement never said that President Obama didn't know about it, like The New York Times told us, just that he didn't order it. So is anyone in the press ever going to ask if Obama knew about the surveillance of an opposition party during an election year, or will they just give him another pass? Here with reaction, editor-in-chief of Lifezette, Fox News contributor, nationally syndicated radio host -- and she's got more titles than any guest we ever had -- and best-selling author, and what -- what are you throwing up in the year, my football?",3,2599.0,421.0,host,62.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07

It looks like everyone from Roger Stone to Carter Page and Paul Manafort, and who knows how many other people were monitored. Now, I guess they're quibbling with the wording of Donald Trump's tweet.

And they did it at the White House briefing today. They went around and around and around with Sean Spicer about this, I think to little or no effect. What you see happening now in Washington is that Donald Trump's moving forward on his key agenda items. And there's a lot of disagreement on those agenda items, even among Republicans, as we're seeing with the ObamaCare fight. But he's moving forward. He needs to keep doing that.

WikiLeaks has not been wrong in over 10 years, not one time have they been proven wrong in terms of what they have released. You're right. If they were using specific deceptive techniques to make it look like the Russians, then that opens up the question, did in fact they try and pin all of this Russia conspiracy stuff that the media has fallen hook, line, and sinker for without any evidence, did they do it internally, the same people that are leaking on Trump?",3,573.0,106.0,host,72.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07

If you're worried about hacking and you even can think it would be related back somehow to the Republican nominee, wouldn't you want to -- wouldn't you want to reveal that?

106,CROWLEY," She's coping with it. Thank you for asking. Alan, was such a gentleman as everybody in his audience knows, and he was the kindest, most decent man you will ever meet. He treated everyone with the same respect and kindness whether you are the president of the United States and or the man on the street. He was my friend.",4,321.0,61.0,guest,94.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07
107,HANNITY," He was my friend even though I disagreed with everything he said. And I was really angry at a couple outlets. We'll deal with that more in the future. So you were going to go to the administration. You got viciously attacked. And by the way, you're not the only one. It's Bannon, it's Reince, it's Kellyanne, it's Steve Miller, it's even Melania, and they're going after Jared, they're going after Ivanka, they even went after a 10-year-old kid. It's pretty ugly. Now they're going after Sebastian Gorka which is ridiculous. But it seems that anyone around the president is getting attacked. And I wanted to give you a chance, because you hadn't been out there publicly for personal and other reasons, to respond to this.",4,722.0,127.0,host,95.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07
108,CROWLEY," Well, look, what happened to me was a despicable, straight up political hit job, OK. It's been debunked. My editor has completely supported me and backed me up. There is a very toxic, and it's getting increasingly toxic and poisonous atmosphere of personal destruction in Washington and the media. It's always sort of been there but now it's at a whole new level. And this is exactly why smart and good people do not want to go into government service. I will tell you that nothing and nobody is ever going to stop me from speaking out on the issues I care about the future of this nation.

110,CROWLEY," Well, and this is the bigger point. In some ways I was something of the canary in the coal mine. The attack on me was a test. What happened to me, what happened to General Flynn, what has happened to Attorney General Sessions and others is all of a piece. There is a very dangerous and very effective destabilization campaign underway against this president, his administration and his agenda. And what I hope that the president and his senior aides understand is that these forces are not just looking to delegitimize him. We often talk about that. Sure they want to do that. They want to personally destroy him, destroy his presidency, and they would like to see the man in prison. I hope that the president understands. I am not overstating this, having been a victim of this myself. They are out for blood. And the reason they have to destroy him is that Donald Trump is an alien organism that has been injected into the body politic by the American people to reform it. He must not be allowed to succeed. They have swarmed him, they have everybody around him in order to reject him out of the system just like any alien organism. He must not be allowed to succeed. And I hope that everybody around him now understands that this is a war, and that they started a long time ago, but they will not end until they get the president of the United States.",4,1355.0,250.0,guest,98.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07
111,HANNITY," I totally agree with you. By the way, I want to say one thing. We have a mutual friend, Andy McCarthy. I don't think you should answer any of these people's questions, because they can go straight to hell. You know how I deal with stuff. I don't care what anybody says, and I thought he did a great job in debunking the issue for you. Here's what's important, though, what you're saying, very important, I think. I see five different factions going after the president. And each one, you've got the snowflake faction, all these protesters that are being paid in many cases to create an image that there is chaos in the country. Then you've got to Democratic Party, obstructionists, want no part of this president succeeding because they look bad and are out of power for a long time. Then you've got a media establishment which we know through WikiLeaks colluded in this last campaign. They never vetted Obama, they never told the truth about what a failure he's been, that's a big part of it. Then you've got Republicans who are weak and timid. And then the fifth part is an intelligence community that is so clearly and obviously, people within it, I have great respect for people in intelligence, but there are those in that community, the swamp, the shadow government that I talk about, the state, if you will, the deep state that we talk about, they're out for blood. And this is five significant, powerful establishment forces that are lined up against this president. This is not a game. They want to destroy him, delegitimize him, and get him out if they can.",4,1568.0,281.0,host,99.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07

114,CROWLEY," David Brock and some of these organizations have already raised tens of millions of dollars for an impeachment process. Then they want jail to the chief. They need to understand that this is a war. We are so far beyond normal politics, Sean, we are in a very dangerous moment. While President Trump is a very strong leader and a man of strong constitution, he was able to survive all of this during the campaign and get elected president. When you're president and you are faced with the kind of monolithic opposition you're talking about, plus a federal bureaucracy that is completely out to undermine him every day, the intelligence community that is engaged in some of this as well that we have heard, I hope to God that he is strong enough to withstand this.

139,"ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY"," Look, Sean, as a former press secretary, my job is to deal with all reporters. And I do and I continue to enjoy doing that. But let me also add, Republicans always have to work twice as hard as Democrats to get a fair break in the press, and Donald Trump is to work three times as hard. And no, it's not fair and balanced. You have to be a professional in this business, and I don't like the idea of professional journalists, neutral journalists saying they're muting a president, a news source. And Mika is an opinion journalist, so she's in a bit of a different category. But people should not be nervous. I said this repeatedly and I say it when I do her show. Let it play out.

Then President Obama was only asked one time during the campaign. Larry, I know you're laughing. Some of this is funny, I've got to admit. But on another level, really, they do want to destroy Trump. They want to destroy the president. They are trying to delegitimize him and they want to stop his agenda, and at most, if they're lucky, they want him out of office.",5,520.0,95.0,host,119.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07
141,"LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL SYNDICATED HOST"," Oh, the inhumanity. The good news for Mika is that under the ObamaCare replacement plan whatever bothering her is probably covered. I really think what's going on here is a deep-seated fear that this SOB might actually be successful. God forbid we get a four percent GDP growth as was the case with Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan when he ran for reelection took 49 states. What did he do? Cut taxes, continued deregulation, and slowed down the rate of nondefense government spending, all of which Donald Trump is doing. You put that together, we get a four percent GDP, none of this stuff will matter.

142,HANNITY," The bottom line, though, Ari, is I have said journalism is dead. Look at, for example, 'The New York Times.' 'The New York Times' reported that the president was wiretapped. They did it multiple times as did the BBC, as did McClatchy, as did other major sources, mainstream media news. The president acknowledges what they reported and somehow he's to blame.    When are they going to ever have some introspection, some self- examination as it relates to colluding with Hillary Clinton? And if they're going to blame Trump for reporting and talking about what they report, when are they going to take the same on themselves? It's kind of hypocritical, isn't it.",5,662.0,113.0,host,121.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07
143,FLEISCHER," It will never happen, Sean. And I'm in a little bit of a different position on this in terms of my viewpoint. I don't think they're dead, but I think they severely wounded themselves, and the American people agree with that.",5,225.0,42.0,guest,122.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07
144,HANNITY, You agree they colluded with Hillary. Would you agree they didn't vet Obama?,5,77.0,14.0,host,123.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07
145,FLEISCHER," Of course. You have them sharing questions for a debate, that happened on the CNN in one instance. And that never should have happened. And so the point is the press is not neutral. The press is biased. I've dealt with that for the decades I was in Washington from Capitol Hill all the way to the White House. It's far worse with Donald Trump. And that's the error we're in now. But look at a day like today. Today was the Trump presidency is and should be about, repealing and replacing Obamacare. Larry is right, these are the big issues upon which President Trump's presidency is going to rise or fall, and today has been a very good day for Donald Trump.",5,659.0,124.0,guest,124.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07
146,HANNITY," I think that's good with one caveat, he's got a lot of conservative opposition. I think they should have built the consensus plan before they released it. That's my own personal view. Secretary Price was very clear that it's going to happen in three phases and all of the critics will be included in the end. Larry, I say that if Donald Trump checks off that promise list and gets it done, he walks into reelection in spite of all the noise that you hear everywhere.",5,467.0,87.0,host,125.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07
147,ELDER," I agree with that 100 percent. It's one thing for the media to be biased, we already knew that. It's another thing for the media to collude. And because of WikiLeaks we found out 'The New York Times,' 'The Washington Post' staffers for Jake Tapper at CNN, Wolf Blitzer, Dana Milbank, the columnist with 'The Washington Post,' contacting the DNC, getting ideas, getting suggestions. This is collusion. This is far beyond just simply having a sympathetic and political agreement with the left. These are people who are literally trying to get Republicans defeated. I've never seen the like of it. And one of the things Donald Trump has done that no other president has done is call them on it, put them on notice, and let people know that they are not just spies, that they are actively trying to stop Republicans. And no one's done that before, and I salute Mr. Trump for having done that.",5,889.0,158.0,guest,126.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-07

0,"SEAN HANNITY, HOST"," And welcome to ""Hannity."" Newt Gingrich, Michelle Malkin will all join us tonight. But first, an explosive new report raises very serious, critical questions about U.S. government surveillance at Trump Tower, where our commander-in-chief's campaign headquarters were located. Now, these are questions that President Barack Obama needs to answer. And that is tonight's ""Opening Monologue."" Investigative journalist Sara Carter from Circa News will joining us in just a minute. Now, she, along with her colleague, John Solomon -- they have confirmed the existence of, in fact, a FISA court warrant order granted in October of 2016, just weeks before the general election, to monitor Trump Tower -- in there, a computer server that was right inside there. Now, the report finds that justification for the warrant was to examine the server that appeared to be communicating with a Russian bank. Officials told Circa News that they quickly determined that nothing, quote, ""was nefarious"" happening or going on there. Now, I can tell you for my own experience -- now, think about this. From my communications during the campaign with the Trump campaign, most of the staffers, 99 percent of them, were all connected to the Trump organization. In other words, their emails. This is beyond troubling. We need answers tonight. Were Trump campaign emails ever connected to the server? If so, were they collected as raw intelligence during the surveillance operation? Now, the reason we ask this is because of what we saw happen to former national security adviser Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. Remember news reports, a December call that he made to a Russian ambassador was captured by what The New York Times described as a, quote, ""routine wiretap"" of the Russian diplomat's phone? Well, U.S. intelligence agencies, they do routinely monitor foreign officials. That's their job. But protections known as minimization procedures have been put in place to ensure that American citizens are not caught up in that surveillance. In other words, they then would have no constitutional rights and that their identities and their rights are protected. Now, this, of course, was not the case with Lieutenant General Flynn because a transcript of the call was created, given to intelligence officials, who then leaked the details to the press, which, by the way, is a felony, according to the Espionage Act. We also know from a New York Times report that in his final weeks in office that President Obama revised the executive order 12333, which greenlights widespread sharing of broad data collected by American intelligence agencies across 17 government agencies. That's an additional 16 agencies, all their employees can now gain access to top-secret intel that they never had access to before. Now, we've been asking, why did President Obama wait until the last minute, two weeks before he leaves, to issue that order? It's an order that he did not apply to himself for eight years. And since this order was signed, well, we've seen an explosion of leaks coming from intelligence agencies. Look at your screen right there. Now, take a good look at it. So given what's happened, it's time for President Obama and officials who oversaw this operation and the surveillance of the server at Trump Tower -- they need to come clean. What do they know? What information was gathered? They need to assure you, the American people, that this was not spying on a political opposition party just weeks before an election. All of this raises very serious national security, ethical issues at a very high level, privacy issues we've never had before, because crimes were likely committed here. Certainly, in the case of retired Lieutenant General Flynn, somebody committed a felony. So all we're doing on this show is we're raising questions. We're looking for answers. In fact, we have reached out to President Obama's spokesperson to see if they would respond to the questions we've been asking. Shocking, so far, we've not heard back. Also tonight, WikiLeaks has released thousands of documents and is making very serious allegations about CIA spying capabilities and techniques.  Now, according to WikiLeaks, U.S. spies are able to access some televisions, smartphones, iPhones and record sound, images, and even private messages on encrypted communication apps. Now, WikiLeaks is also alleging that the CIA has the ability to make it appear that its cyber activity was conducted by foreign governments, oh, say, like Russia or hackers. Now, the group explained further in a press release. They said, quote, ""The CIA's remote devices branch, UMBRAGE group, collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques stolen from malware produced in other states, including the Russian Federation. And with UMBRAGE and related projects, the CIA can not only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect the attribution by leaving behind these, quote, ""fingerprints"" of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from. In other words, they can make it seem like it's the Russians, and it's them! Now, the power and capabilities of American intelligence agencies are profound, and they are extensive. And if all of this is true, what that means is the possibility that an operative working on behalf of the former president and other left-wing activists are trying to sabotage, delegitimize President Donald Trump. After all, why did the leaks happen as soon as Obama left? Until we get answers, we're going to keep asking these questions. Here now is Circa News national security correspondent Sara Carter. Sara, do I have all that right? Is that a good summary?",1,5670.0,921.0,host,1.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
1,"SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS"," Yes, it was a great summary. There was one a little change that just happened right before I came on your show, Sean.  And what was really interesting -- John and I spoke to a very senior U.S. official, they clarified this. They said there was a FISA warrant in October that was looking at the overall Russian hacking investigation, but that the FBI, when they monitored the server at Trump Tower, it was actually located away from Trump Tower. It wasn't under the FISA. They did normal strategic type of FBI investigations that didn't require the FISA. So they went in -- they went into the server, but they did not use the FISA to do that.

He said, Well, I didn't order, nor did anyone in the White House order the FISA investigation. But that's not an acknowledgement -- did he know? Did Ben Rhodes know?  Did Loretta Lynch sign off on it? Did any -- Valerie Jarrett know about this? Did Dan Pfeiffer? In the middle of a campaign, you have a sitting president with the power over the intelligence community looking into an opposition candidate in the weeks leading up to an election?

63,GINGRICH," Well, I think, first of all, it's very likely that the deep state, the professional bureaucrats, the people who run the government on a day-to-day basis did do things that were very opposed to Donald Trump. I mean, the fact is that he was overwhelmingly opposed by the civil service. I think it's also likely that there was -- covering up is probably the wrong word, but that they were willing to be sloppy and to be more aggressive. And the whole thing was done to General Flynn was totally outrageous, violates every civil libertarian in the country, involved the leaking, which is a felony -- the leaking of secret information, which was done in such a way as to hurt an American citizen, even though when you looked at it in detail, it had no meaning. It didn't matter. By the way, you'll notice that The Washington Post and The New York Times, in their continuing war on the Trump administration, went way out of their way to try to smear and destroy Attorney General Sessions, a very -- again, very similar kind of pattern we're seeing, whether it's in leaking or it is in wiretapping, or it is in a variety of other collusions between the deep state bureaucracy and the deep state media.",2,1195.0,217.0,guest,61.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08

88,RYAN," I'm prepared to lead our conference to doing what we said we would do in the election. We actually ran on a repeal and replace plan. That's what this is, the repeal and replace plan we ran on. Now I am intent on making sure that we fulfill our promises. What I want to tell my fellow citizens is the nightmare of ObamaCare is about to end, that we are doing what we said we would do in this campaign, which is repeal and replace this awful law that is crashing.",3,462.0,92.0,guest,81.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08

90,HANNITY," All right, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan vowing to fulfill the GOP's promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare. President Trump met earlier this evening with members of the Freedom Caucus to discuss the new health care bill. As I said last night, they need to hammer out their differences because we cannot have a GOP civil war breaking out in the media. It's only going to hurt their ability to get things done, and that means hurt you, the American people. We continue now more with Newt Gingrich. The Club for Growth, Heritage Action, Americans for Prosperity, FreedomWorks, the Freedom Caucus, some members of the Study Committee, Rand Paul, Mike Lee, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio are against this bill. Here's my question. This has been discussed as their primary agenda item, Mr. Speaker, for eight years. They released the bill -- they rolled out a bill yesterday, and there's not consensus. Why didn't they build the consensus, finish the bill in the square that you told me about, how legislation gets made, how the sausage gets made, before they rolled it out? And then have -- maybe something that can never happen. A president with every Republican House member, every Republican senator behind him, this is our answer to ObamaCare. We're all in agreement. We're going to pass it today. Am I naive to think that something like that could have happened rather than the squabbling that's going on on TV the last 24?",3,1418.0,246.0,host,82.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
91,GINGRICH," I think that might have been done, but it would be very, very hard. I think there are two key things to remember about where we are. The first is this bill is the beginning of a three or four or five step process. This is not the only bill that is going to come down the road on health care.",3,292.0,62.0,guest,83.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
92,HANNITY, But they knew what the criticisms were before within their own ranks.,3,70.0,13.0,host,84.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
93,GINGRICH," Sure. And you can divide the criticisms in a couple ways. One is if you want to pass something very early, you're going to have to pass it under Senate reconciliation rules. That's just a fact.",3,194.0,37.0,guest,85.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
94,HANNITY, Right.,3,7.0,2.0,host,86.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
95,GINGRICH," Now, if that's what you're going to do, those rules define narrowly what can be in the bill. So at least half the complaints are about a reality that Paul Ryan at the Mitch McConnell are working with.  Second --",3,212.0,41.0,guest,87.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
96,HANNITY," And that's legitimate, by the way. That's all true, 100 percent.",3,65.0,12.0,host,88.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
97,GINGRICH," Second, in the Senate, the margin is closer than it looks because it takes 50 votes plus Vice President Pence. That means you can lose to. And you can lose two on the right, you can lose two on the left, you can lose two in the middle over things like, for example, whether or not they're going to have opioid treatments or they're going to drop them which for somebody like Senator Portman who has made an enormous number of speeches on the opioid epidemic really is central. And it's not a right or left issue. It's a practical issue. So you have all this stuff going on at once. I probably would frankly have been pretty close to what Paul Ryan did. Bring a bill out, go to markups, allow amendments. Then they go from energy and commerce and ways and means to a markup in the budget committee of the combined bill. Then you go to the rules committee. And members of the Freedom Caucus can walk in and say we want to put these amendments in order. And if they can say we're not going to vote for the rule unless we get some amendments. This is the legislative process. My only point would be, and I think it's fair from a Paul Ryan standpoint to be slightly perplexed. This is not a perfect bill. I want to emphasize, this is the first of five or six reform efforts that are going to come out during the course of the year.",3,1327.0,256.0,guest,89.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
98,HANNITY, Tom Price last night said that this is going to be rolled out three different ways. So that actually made me feel a little better. But I wish they would've explained it better.,3,177.0,34.0,host,90.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
99,GINGRICH," I think had they started originally, and I agree with this, and I think it's the one criticism than the president should take to heart. If they had started by saying let us give you a context. You're going to get a first bill designed to get through the Senate, not designed to be perfect, designed to get through the Senate so the president can sign it as rapidly as possible. Big a step towards repeal. And guess what, you're not going to get any Democrats. No Democrat is good to vote to repeal this.",3,504.0,96.0,guest,91.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08

103,GINGRICH," Well, no. I just think there is sometimes, and I do think if you look, for example, at the Medicaid reform, it may be the biggest conservative reform since the welfare reform bill of 96. These are not small things.",3,215.0,41.0,guest,95.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08

105,GINGRICH," Well, and they better plan on a second bill and they better plan on Tom Price doing a series of regulatory changes. This dance will go on all year. But I want to say one other thing that's really important.  Republicans cannot allow the Trump administration to fail in its first big effort. When you're done fighting, you're done complain, you're done amending, virtually every Republican ought to vote yes. We'll have another fight in six weeks and two months. But it's very important that President Trump have a win on this bill.",3,532.0,94.0,guest,97.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
106,HANNITY," I agree, big time. Big time, I totally agree with that. Mr. Speaker, always good to see you, thank you.",3,104.0,21.0,host,98.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08

110,HANNITY," Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So this week WikiLeaks released a new batch of documents allegedly containing information about tactics the CIA uses as part of its surveillance program. Joining us now with reaction, former intelligence official of the U.S. National Security Agency William Binney, and former senior intelligence officer, Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer. Mr. Binney, let me start with you. One of the things, I have a headline here in front of me, ""WikiLeaks, CIA uses stolen malware to attribute cyber-attacks to nations like Russia."" And what they're really implying here is that they would deliberately mimic the hacking protocols of Russia to obfuscate their own works. Do you believe that's true?",4,713.0,113.0,host,101.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
111,"BILL BINNEY, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY OFFICIAL"," Yes, sure. I think that that's true, as well as I think a lot of the software that they've gotten to do the penetrations came from NSA, and the other five eyes plus other cooperating countries. And of course they gained additional information once they penetrated into people like the Russians and the Ukrainians.",4,314.0,55.0,guest,102.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
112,HANNITY, Is it legal for them to do that at the CIA?,4,44.0,12.0,host,103.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
113,BINNEY," Actually, it's not their charter, but they certainly are doing it and they have been doing it for many decades. It's nothing new for them.  They've been using signals intelligence for quite some time.",4,201.0,35.0,guest,104.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
114,HANNITY," In other words, we do know what happened in the case of General Flynn, that was a felony, a violation of the Espionage Act, even though he did have in his case a security clearance. Maybe they could have listened but it was certainly illegal to release that. Colonel Shaffer, what is your take on all of this? And when the intelligence community, and I'm sure it's just a few people, I have great faith in our intelligence services, and what they do is really dangerous and important.         ",4,494.0,90.0,host,105.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08

116,HANNITY," But if they're leaking information on Americans and using techniques that could possibly spy through our TVs and not allow full encryptions of our phones, that's troubling to me.",4,179.0,30.0,host,107.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
117,SHAFFER," Part of the deal is all those vulnerabilities, Sean, you just mentioned, the bad guys have, too. This has always been one of my concerns. I've done this sort of thing for a living, about the time Wayne was doing it. My concern was on the inside is these people, our intelligence agencies, have huge technology and huge power. So that power must be used ethically and focused on the adversary only. What you've seen here, as you pointed out, Sean, it was used against one of our own. Lieutenant General Mike Flynn is a friend of mine. On a personal level, I think it's horrendous. On a legal level, it needs to be prosecuted. So I think we have to understand it's good that we understand these things. It's good we have people who understand the tools. But how you use those tools ethically, legally, and morally is hugely important.",4,833.0,152.0,guest,108.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
118,HANNITY," Colonel, if the CIA, in fact WikiLeaks, they have a track record.  They've not been wrong in all the years of existence. They've not been proven wrong one at time. And I'm looking at these documents, I guess the most frightening thing if you're in the government as they release less than one percent of the information they say they have. And they're talking about more powerful surveillance techniques than even the NSA without checks and balances. The fact that they built a cyber-attack arsenal that $100 billion came from the Obama years, and that it implies that every single electronic device, they are capable of hacking and spying through, and even turning TVs into listening devices. Do you believe that?  Do you think the CIA has that capability? And if they do, if there is no check and balance, doesn't that mean were all potentially subject to living in a police state where the government at will can spy on whoever they want, bribe, blackmail, do whatever they want with that? That's scary.",4,1007.0,175.0,host,109.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
119,SHAFFER," That is the danger of having this. And unfortunately, Sean, this is one of the few times I cannot comment on what you're asking me. I used to do this for a living. I will say this. I think some of those things are even more powerful than you know, than you listed. And that's why ethically, legally, and as William said, you have to be very specific about how you use Title 18 as law enforcement, Title 10 as military, Title 50 as intelligence which has use first restrictions. President Obama, I have a feeling, didn't care. He just told people to go out and do things. And this is where, morally, you have to have someone who is at the top willing to do the hard things and says it is my job to restrict people from using those things.",4,738.0,143.0,guest,110.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08

121,SHAFFER," Precisely. And this is where we were going. Let me say this. I don't know if Bill will agree with me or not. ATP 2829, the so called Russian tool that was used to hack the DNC, Sean, we did it. Not me, but our guys. Former members of NSA, retired intelligence officers use these tools to break in there and get the information out. That's what the Democrats don't want to talk about because it doesn't fit their narrative.",4,423.0,81.0,guest,112.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08
122,HANNITY," You know that for a fact? You know the Democrats did it -- or that former operatives did it using the malware techniques, that they put the Russian fingerprints on it and make it appear like the Russians. In other words, you're telling me this whole Russian story that the media has been running with for months and months and months, that it was our people that did it and they put the fingerprints of the Russians on it?",4,423.0,80.0,host,113.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08

125,SHAFFER," I don't have proof of it, but I'm telling you this is what I've heard. And what I'm telling you is if you go back and actually talk to people inside, the evidence is not that the Russians did it. The evidence is a Russian tool was used. What I'm saying is concerned Americans who are fed up with the Clintons doing things I think were the ones who got in there and broke the information out and give it to WikiLeaks. And I've mentioned this to other reporters, by the way. They don't seem to be interested in going and checking this out, because it doesn't --",4,560.0,109.0,guest,116.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-08

133,BINNEY," If I could point out a greater danger here, Sean. The point is they know about all these weaknesses and firewalls, operating systems, switches, servers, and so on and how to break into them. And they aren't fixing them.

0,"SEAN HANNITY, HOST"," And welcome to ""Hannity."" In just a few moments, Laura Ingraham -- she'll join us. For weeks, we've been warning you about the deep state Obama holdover government bureaucrats who are hell-bent on destroying this president, President Trump. It's time for the Trump administration to begin to purge these saboteurs before it's too late. That's tonight's ‘Opening Monologue.’ Let's go back to 1861. President Abraham Lincoln -- he created, you know, a team of rivals, a so-called team of rivals, a cabinet of rivals, including adversaries that he ran against in the Republican primary. But while President Lincoln sought to unify his party through cabinet selections, he also executed an extensive government purge. He fired over 75 percent, nearly 1,200 people out of 1,500 bureaucrats that worked in the executive branch who President Lincoln feared could be disloyal. It's time now for President Trump to follow Abraham Lincoln's example and a fire anyone and everyone who is actively working against him in government. After all, even former president Bill Clinton -- he utilized this tactic back in 1993. He fired all 93 U.S. attorneys -- all of them. According to Conservative Review's Daniel Horowitz, sacking imposing government employees is best utilized at the start of an administration. He writes, quote, ‘Clinton easily fired all 93 U.S. attorneys on day one. Nobody blinked an eye. Yet when Bush's attorney general fired eight U.S. attorneys well into his second term, well, that became a national scandal.’ It's very important for President Trump to act right now and not just avoid outrage from the left -- that's not what this is about -- because he's got to end the leaks that are plaguing this administration. Major leaks, like the ones you see right there on your screen, started just five days after President Trump was sworn into office. The explosion of these leaks coincides with a New York Times report that says in his final weeks in office; President Obama revised executive order 12333 which allows the widespread sharing of this raw data collected by American intelligence agencies across 17 government agencies. That is an additional 16 agencies and their employees who in the final two weeks when Obama was in office, who gained access to top-secret intelligence that they never had access to before. We've been asking for weeks on this program, why did President Obama wait until the last minute to do this? And why didn't he apply this to himself for eight years? Congressman Duncan Hunter -- he's expressing serious concern about what we see playing out, and take a look at what he said earlier today.",1,2634.0,438.0,host,1.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09

2,"REP. DUNCAN HUNTER, R-CALIF."," Overall, I think that they're dealing with seditious people within the Department of Justice, within the FBI, within the Department of Interior, within the CIA. There are just people that don't approve of the Trump presidency, and I think that they're trying to take him down from the inside. That sounds kind of conspiratorial, but I think that's what Trump's looking at right now. I think you have people within the government, what you call the deep state, bureaucrats, Obama appointees that hate Donald Trump.",1,514.0,86.0,guest,2.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09

4,HANNITY," Congressman Steve King -- he tweeted the following. ‘Donald Trump needs to purge leftists from the executive branch before disloyal, illegal and treasonous acts sink us.’ It's important that the president begin to hear this and act now. For months, deep state antagonists -- they've been working overtime to try and delegitimize Donald Trump's presidency. And we have seen how low they'll go by insinuating without any evidence that there's some sort of campaign collusion with Russia. There's no evidence! It's not true! Just days ago, WikiLeaks published some very disturbing information about the CIA. According to Julian Assange, CIA operatives are able to access televisions of American citizens, smartphones, other devices, and actually recorded sound, images and even encrypted messages on your iPhone or your Android. That's not all. WikiLeaks is also alleging that the CIA has the ability to utilize very sophisticated malware that can make it appear that cyber activity is being conducted by other nations, when, in fact, they -- meaning those within our government -- may be responsible. WikiLeaks in their press release specifically points out that they could be doing this in the case of this Russian narrative with no evidence. By the way, did President Obama know about any of these sophisticated spy programs developed and used by the CIA? We can't confirm that any of this is actually being practiced, but we need to start asking serious questions if we want privacy in this country. Back in January, you may remember I traveled to London. I interviewed Julian Assange. He told me his source repeatedly was not the Russians.

9,HANNITY," That's not all. Former British ambassador Craig Murray -- he told The Daily Mail that the 2016 Clinton campaign e-mail hack -- it actually come from within the Democratic Party and that the hacked information was given to him in a public park at a university right here on American property. Can you believe that? All on behalf of the Democratic Party, their own whistleblower. My message tonight is simple. Every holdover from the Obama administration -- they need to go! And a thorough investigation of leakers needs to be conducted. And people have committed felonies, violated the Espionage Act, like in the case of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn -- they need to be prosecuted! And all of those who aren't actively working to fix the country need to be shown the door. It's hurting a lot of people. Joining us now, editor-in-chief of Lifezette, Fox News contributor, nationally syndicated radio host Laura Ingraham is with us, and the author of ""The Big Agenda,"" David Horowitz is back with us. Laura, I'm looking at all this here. We've got all of these leaks happening, which all of a sudden, they just started happening when Donald Trump became president. So we politicize -- some in the intelligence community are politicized, not all, there are a lot of good people there, but some. And look at what Lincoln did. Look at what Clinton did. Is it time for the same type of actions by President Trump?",1,1410.0,245.0,host,6.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09
10,"LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX CONTRIBUTOR"," I have to say, I was scratching my head, Sean, when I learned -- and I know you were concerned about it, as well -- there were a number of Obama holdovers that remained behind after inauguration. Part of it was the slow pace of the transition after they showed Chris Christie the door and brought a new team in. They were behind of the appointments. Some of it was Democrats slow walking the appointments. But they were behind on a lot of the appointments. So remember what happened in the NSA, where two of Ben Rhodes's -- you know, obviously top aide to President Obama -- two of his aides stayed behind in key positions at the National Security Agency.",1,656.0,122.0,guest,7.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09

Both of them were donors to the Clinton campaign, it was revealed later on. So it made no sense that they were allowed to stay. That was a mistake by the Trump team. And I fear that there are other people that we're just now learning about who were political appointees, Sean, but who converted to career appointments, which is supposed to be reviewed by the personnel office and not sure it has been or hasn't been properly vetted. The Republicans should be asking answers (sic) about this on Capitol Hill. How many people converted from political appointments to career appointments to be able to stay behind in the administration? And we know at least a few of them.

15,HANNITY," As shocking as the WikiLeaks reveals were, David Horowitz, one of the things that really stood out in my mind is not only the fact that they could spy on TV that we think is off, that there's no -- there's not the privacy we think we're getting or the encryption our iPhones or Androids that we think we're getting, but the fact that the CIA can use stolen malware and attribute cyber-attacks to other nations. And I want to know what Obama knew about what the CIA was doing and whether or not maybe, as we're told by John Solomon and his partner, Sara Carter, yesterday, there is no evidence, even though there was a FISA warrant, of any Russian collusion.

That's what partisans did against the Nazis. That's not what an opposition party in a democracy does. Was Trump Tower tapped? Of course it was! The NSA collects every communication. The question is, can the raw intelligence be opened and used? And to answer that, you have to say, Well, does Barack Obama or the Democratic Party -- do they respect our national security laws? And the answer is obvious. No! Hillary Clinton violated the Espionage Act. She put on her private server for all our enemies to see top classified information. There wasn't one Democrat who said, This is a bridge too far, I can't support this woman, not one!",1,780.0,137.0,guest,15.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09
19,HANNITY," Let me go to -- let me go to the John Solomon, Sara Carter piece, and let me tie it to WikiLeaks, Laura, if I can because they said, in fact, that FISA warrant in October, in the middle of a presidential election where you have a sitting president, there was surveillance going on. What he knew, what he didn't know, I don't know. But that would have had to have been approved by the attorney general at the time, Loretta Lynch. When you put their revelation that nothing about the Russia collusion is true, nothing, that there was nothing found, but the fact that the server in the Trump organization was tapped by the government and another wiretap took place, that's kind of scary that -- and who knew what, when and where needs to be asked, not that Obama didn't order it, what did he know?",1,795.0,149.0,host,16.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09
20,INGRAHAM," Right. Well, the tactics of a police state include targeting individuals, of course, for political purposes. So you don't base your investigations on real probable cause for any criminal violation. But it's based only on political disagreement. And if we had partisans running these investigations, so-called investigations, and if Loretta Lynch OKed this in the middle of a presidential campaign, where no prior information came up that would indicate that the Russians were colluding with Paul Manafort or Carter Page or any of these other people, then you have ask yourself this question. Why was to done? Why was it done in October? Why did they keep surveilling the Trump team, and can anyone really think for a moment that Loretta Lynch would OK this and not run it by President Obama? I mean, I guess you want to keep plausible deniability, but I think that -- that's -- that doesn't really pass the straight face test.",1,927.0,158.0,guest,17.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09

She's -- now she's advocating street demonstrations by radicals who openly want to overthrow this regime. We're in a very dangerous situation, and I can't say how totally I endorse what you've been saying editorially, that they need to fire all of the Democrat appointees in these departments. 99 percent of the Justice Department, according to Newt Gingrich, gave money to the Democrats.

84,"SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST"," All right, that was speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, earlier today stressing how important it is for Republicans to come together, repeal and replace Obamacare. President Trump wrote earlier on Twitter today ""Despite what you hear in the press, health care is coming along great. We're talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture."" Joining us now with reaction, the House majority leader, Congressman Kevin McCarthy. Sir, how are you?",3,453.0,76.0,host,67.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09
85,"REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, R, HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER", I'm doing well. And you?,3,25.0,6.0,guest,68.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09
86,HANNITY," I'm good. Let me get to the first question, which is a process question, because even before the bill actually came out, you had to members of the Freedom Caucus, a lot of them, the study group, Senators Paul, Cruz, Lee, and Marco Rubio. And afterwards you had the Club for Growth, Americans for Prosperity, Freedom Works, Heritage Action, all against it. And I guess what surprised me about it is why didn't you get this consensus built to work on the bill that everyone agreed on before you released it, and now you're doing it all in the public eye and it seems confusing, and people are asking why didn't you guys work this out before?",3,640.0,118.0,host,69.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09
87,MCCARTHY," We did work it out before. If you listen to the Freedom Caucus in the very beginning of January, they asked us to make sure that we will not repeal without replacing at the same time. If you look at the conservative bill that we have before you, much of that element was Tom Price's bill when it was inside the House. And you had numbers of Freedom Caucus cosponsor that. The challenge is the process of how we have to do this. Because we don't have 60 votes, and that's what puts the fear in me is the challenge of the structure to go about doing. We have to do three different phases. One in reconciliation, repeal and replace. But because of the Senate rules, we can't do everything we want. Those things administratively the power gives to Tom Price. And then those bills that take 60 votes, we'll move those along at the same time and right afterwards. At the end we end up the exact same place. This is the most conservative bill. It repeals all the taxes.",3,963.0,182.0,guest,70.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09
88,HANNITY," So there's three phases to this. But the critics -- my tie is crooked -- and the critics, they're all saying the same thing, this doesn't fully repeal it. In other words what they're asking and have been asking to do is go back to the 2015 bill which was a full repeal. At the same time you follow-up immediately with a replacement bill. Why can't that be done?",3,362.0,70.0,host,71.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09
89,MCCARTHY," This is the same bill that we put on President Obama's desk when we repealed it. But take for instance that process. If we repealed everything, we would still need 60 votes to pass something new. Then you're going to have to negotiate with all those Democrats. It would not be as conservative as this current bill to get 60 votes. Secondly, if you repealed it without replacing it, your premiums would double, the market would collapse, you wouldn't have the market built on the outside to take people up. And who would own that problem, Sean? It would be Donald Trump and all the Republicans currently in office.",3,614.0,110.0,guest,72.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09
90,HANNITY," Listen, this has to work. There's no option here. This is the first legislative agenda item that the president is now passing here. So at some point in the Freedom Caucus, those senators I mentioned, those groups, you're going to need them. Is it a communication problem that they don't the three step process, or is their criticisms valid that it's not a complete repeal, that there still some taxes from ObamaCare that exist, and not everything is free-market, that there is even a new entitlement, which is the main argument I hear they're making every hour of every day now on television.",3,593.0,104.0,host,73.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09

94,HANNITY, Why are the Freedom Caucus guys saying that? Why is Senator Rand Paul saying that?,3,83.0,16.0,host,77.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09
95,MCCARTHY, What Rand Paul would like to do is repeal it and then go into and try to find 60 votes for it. You and I both know how difficult it is to find 60 votes.,3,153.0,36.0,guest,78.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09
96,HANNITY," You're right on reconciliation. I totally understand there's a legislative complication. Good point, better to have 51 votes only needed than 60. So explain the three step process, and without the Freedom Caucus and those senators this bill doesn't get passed. What are you going to do in terms of getting everybody together and making this work? And I'd be open to coming down and doing a full on town hall with all sides. Would you participate?",3,447.0,78.0,host,79.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09
97,MCCARTHY," I'll participate anyway, because this is the most conservative bill you're going to find. This is Obamacare gone. It repeals all the taxes. That's what we just did last night in Ways and Means committee.",3,204.0,36.0,guest,80.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09
98,HANNITY," Here's my question, if you'll come, I'll come down next week. And we can tape an hour for TV. And I'll bring you, I'll invite the senators I mentioned, and I'll invite another couple Freedom Caucus guys, and maybe we can hash it out there, and maybe we'll bring in Reince Priebus and see whatever differences exist, if it can't get worked out. Would you be willing to do that?",3,377.0,71.0,host,81.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09
99,MCCARTHY," I'd be glad. We're talking every day in the process. Listen, ObamaCare did three essential items. They put control of health care into federal government. They were the exchanges, and then they were the expansion of Medicaid. What does this bill do? It frees up and gives all those rights to the states, which we believe is very conservative. Secondly, we repealed all the taxes, very conservative. Thirdly what we did, too, the exchanges have now collapsed, so we have to take, one, a tax credit. Sean, when you let people keep more of their own money and make their own decisions in healthcare, that's the most conservative approach.",3,636.0,110.0,guest,82.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09
100,HANNITY, That's not a new entitlement?,3,30.0,6.0,host,83.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09

104,HANNITY," All right, we're going to -- basically, listen, I'm taking a lot of incoming from people. A lot of people are angry and frustrated, and the votes aren't there. And this has to succeed. But more importantly than succeed, it has to be done right, because as soon as it's replaced, you own it. And it's got to be something that lowers costs, offers more care, more free-market competition, health care savings, cooperatives, which all need to be a part of it. I think those are the points we all agree on.",3,503.0,93.0,host,87.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09
105,MCCARTHY," Sean, that's exactly what you're talking about in this bill. And if all you did was repeal, everything else would collapse, and then we would own that.",3,152.0,28.0,guest,88.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-09

The report notes that this decline is significant because, quote, ""border patrol historically sees a 10 to 20 increase in apprehensions of illegal immigrants from January to February.""

""CBS Evening News,"" NBC Nightly News, January 20th until February 20th, out of 100 stories on those two networks on the evening broadcasts, and these are big because it's eight to 10 million people watching each of them, 97 of them out of 100 were negative.

Here you have the act that their focus is so primarily on negative coverage on Trump. The American people are getting tired of it. You have a poll that just came out that said 59 percent in an IPD poll basically said that they are weary of the persistence negative coverage of Donald Trump. Now, what are the liberal media doing? They are focused on placating their base. They are focused on making sure that they built this narrative that President Trump is a villain. And they're missing the point that President Trump actually in these past 40-something days has spent more time reaching across the aisle, working with traditional Democratic coalition groups like African-Americans, like the unions. He is meeting with moderate Democrats. Those stories are being missed.

6,HANNITY,"  Wow.  No matter how much improvement America sees over the next four years, no matter how many jobs are added, no matter how much wealth will be generated, that kind of Russia-obsessed conspiracy propaganda -- it appears that's all you're going to hear from the left-wing media. Now, meanwhile, none of the so-called journalists are even willing to conduct an investigation behind this unprecedented and in some cases absolutely criminal leaks that are happening in Washington, like the ones you see right there on your screen.  Those are leaks since Trump's become president. However, at Circa News, two very well respected journalists -- they have conducted a thorough investigation into the Trump-Russia collusion claims. And what did they discover?  Just weeks before the election, the FBI received a warrant to investigate a server connected to Donald Trump's businesses, but they found no wrongdoing, no collusion with the Russians. And around the same time, in fact, in October, a FISA warrant was also granted to investigate potential Russian influence in the election. Now, if the mainstream media cared about presenting the whole truth, they should run headlines like this -- Federal investigation finds no evidence to date that Trump campaign colluded with Russia.  I'm not going to hold my breath that someone will actually publish this, even though they should tell the American people the truth. And that's the problem.  Time and time again, the media is so focused on pushing their radical, lazy agenda, they fail to see the truth that's right in front of them.  Now, they never vetted Barack Obama.  They never admitted to colluding with the Clinton campaign and acting as her surrogate.  And they utterly failed to predict the rise of President Trump. So who can disagree with me that they are abusively biased?  Who can disagree with Steve Bannon when he calls them the opposition party in this country?  Now, many in the media -- they're so deeply invested in seeing that President Trump fails, well, many deep state Obama-era holdovers -- they're still entrenched in government. And by the way, I'm not the only one that feels this way.  For example, former Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich -- he said that President Trump has a point about the wiretapping.  Take a look.",1,2299.0,378.0,host,5.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-10

Joining us now from Circanews.com, Sara Carter is back with us.  What you and John Solomon broke to me is huge.  Nobody was able to confirm what you guys have, that, number one, a FISA warrant was issued.  Correct?  You're 100 percent sure.",1,544.0,90.0,host,14.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-10
22,"SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS","  We're 100 percent sure, yes.  A FISA warrant was issued on the overall investigation into Russian hacking, and a separate warrant was issued to investigate the server that was registered to Trump Tower. And there was absolutely no evidence discovered during that search, and it was a very brief search of that computer server.  It yielded no evidence whatsoever that alarmed the FBI that there was any criminal connection between Trump or any of his surrogates, anybody on the Trump team, with Russia.  So they shut it down quickly. But you asked the question, when did Hillary know about it?  Remember, she tweeted about it and Slate -- Slate news magazine also wrote a story about it at the same time.  She talked about these nefarious connections between Trump and Russia and his server.  And then we had Harry Reid last October make those same claims. But remember, it was in October when the FBI opened their investigation into the server and closed it within the month of October because they found nothing.",1,1015.0,174.0,guest,15.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-10
23,HANNITY,"  OK, now, Sara, so this is amazing.  We've been hearing for months and months and months and months potential FISA surveillance warrants being issued, other warrants.  The president tweets out that there was surveillance, where he said wiretapped -- really just interchanging and parsing words. He's right.  The media blasted him for that tweet that he sent out.  But there was surveillance.  There were two warrants.  It happened.  They found no evidence at all to say that there was any collusion. Don't you think, in light of all of the media coverage of this, that there's a dereliction of duty in informing the American people what you and John Solomon, both great, objective journalists, investigative reporters, have found.  Don't you think these are major headlines they're ignoring?",1,792.0,128.0,host,16.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-10
24,CARTER,"  Absolutely.  I mean, I think what you need to do is go to the truth.  I tell you where there is evidence, though, Sean.  there will be evidence as to who leaked this information if there are good investigators willing to find out who did.  And that's where the trail of bread crumbs will be because even though -- Even though there is a wide expanse of intelligence agencies that can access this type of information, the leak on Flynn's telephone call -- that was signals intelligence.  That's a felony. Revealing that like they did to The Washington Post, to David Ignatius, is actually a felony. And every time you go into a SCIF -- that's a compartmentalized room that is highly guarded so you can look at this information.  Every time you go on there, you leave a marker, and that marker remains there, so that people can go back see who viewed that information.  So if somebody wants to find out who the leaker is, if somebody wants to find out who violated federal law and leaked classified information on the wiretaps that were on the Russian ambassador -- not on Trump, but they were on the Russian ambassador at that time and not on Flynn -- they can find out. That evidence is there.  So I believe that whoever is appointed to investigate on the leaks will eventually sniff out that person, and that person will be exposed.",1,1335.0,242.0,guest,17.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-10

28,"NEWT GINGRICH, R-FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX CONTRIBUTOR","  Well, you know, the first thing that hit me tonight, listening carefully to that interview-- and she really made some good points -- the second warrant, which apparently went right at the campaign computer, is sort of the electronic equivalent of Watergate.  I mean, in 1972, when the Nixon operatives, who were government employees, broke into the Democratic headquarters to find out what the Democrats were up to, that was considered such a huge scandal, it ultimately cost President Nixon his job. Now, what you have now is electronically, the federal government has gone into a campaign computer in what was clearly a fishing expedition.  They found nothing.  But they, in effect, ran the risk of violating the campaign, and it makes the question, why would you -- why would the court had issued a warrant to go into a political campaign computer when there is, in fact, no evidence that the campaign was in any way involved with the Russians?",1,949.0,162.0,guest,21.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-10

And I kept going.  You said I'm probably risking everything doing it.  But they never vetted him.  They never told the story of how his rigid ideology failed this country.  They colluded with Hillary Clinton.  Now they are hell-bent on bringing destruction to this president.

Look, I think it's pretty straightforward.  And I actually like the phrase that Trump has used before.  You have fake news.  The fake news is created by people like The Washington Post and The New York Times because they're waging war on the Trump administration.

Then Paul Ryan, with the help of the president and vice president, has to get a majority of the vote to go to the Senate.  The Senate's going to be very different.  You're going to really dislike this, Sean, because the Senate margin is so narrow.  You know, they've got to get 50 plus Vice President Pence. That means they got two votes to play with.  Well, you got two or three moderates on one side.  As you point out correctly, you got three or four conservatives on the other side.  And then you have people who have real concerns, such as Senator Portman's concern about the opioid crisis.  All of the those have to be blended to get to 50 and Pence as a minimum.

88,GOOLSBEE,"  But my question to you, Sean, my question to you is this.  Do you really want us to trust the government as much as you're talking about? If Donald Trump hired a national security advisor and the media comes to find out that he was being paid as a lobbyist for a foreign country, you really want them not to report that?  Should they not say that?",3,349.0,68.0,guest,67.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-10
89,HANNITY,"  Listen to me, that is legitimate.  Even Trump said there are going to be stories I don't like.  But it's legitimate journalism.  Nobody is talking about shutting down the press.  I'm saying there is this hyperventilating hysteria that has emerged which is very different from what you are discussing.   But I would also add, and you should as a liberal that believes in privacy, I assume, they shouldn't have leaked from the intelligence community a conversation when they were surveilling not General Flynn but the Russian ambassador.  That is illegal.  That is a violation of the Espionage Act, and that ended up in his career going up in smoke.  So I would think on that issue, that is more important.  ",3,708.0,123.0,host,68.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-10

92,MARTOSKO,"  No, it's not.  Let's be very honest about this.  There are some very skilled, smart, and honest reporters covering the White House right now, but there are also some people who are just waking up every morning looking for the silver bullet that is going to kill the Trump monster. There are journalists like that. One of the things ""The Daily Mail"" has always been very good at it is just having a bias toward interesting stories.  A lot of the stuff about Russia isn't all that interesting to people.  It doesn't penetrate.  ",3,528.0,95.0,guest,71.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-10

0,"SEAN HANNITY, HOST"," This is a Fox News Alert. Tonight, we have more evidence of Obama deep state shadow government holdover saboteurs -- they are breaking laws all in an effort to undermine and delegitimize the newly elected president. NBC News in particular is on a political jihad against the president and his administration. And that is tonight's ""Opening Monologue."" All right, tonight, we've hit a new low in terms of privacy as we know it here in our country, and it should deeply concern all of you, the American people. Now, just a short time ago, one of the Trump-hating hosts over at NBC News who is really one of the leaders of the alt-left propaganda destroy Trump at all costs media, well, she got her hands on President Trump's -- two pages -- of his 2005 tax return. Now, in many ways, this should be troublesome to everybody, but also, there are many, many legal questions that we'll get into tonight. For example, according to 26 U.S. Code 7213, quote, ""It shall be unlawful for any officer or employee of the United States or any person described in section 6103 and (ph)-- or any former officer or employee of any such person or any former officer or employee, willfully to disclose to any person except as authorized in this title, any return or return information."" By the way, that's a felony. They say they found it in a mailbox, and it could be related to the Russians. Now, that could result in a $5,000 fine, five years in prison.   Now, tonight of the -- ahead of this criminal release, well, the White House revealed, well, in 2005, Donald Trump paid $38 million in taxes on a $150 million in income, which by the way, legal deductions, I'm sure.  That's not a scandal, but here is what the scandal is tonight. We have been reporting on these deep state actors in great detail for weeks. They have been working tirelessly nonstop since November the 8th behind the scenes. Why? They want to create a false narrative that President Trump colluded with the Russians. Now, of course, reports have now been debunked. That is a fake news story. We've also told you about now just weeks before he left office, President Obama altered executive order 12333 which allowed widespread sharing of broad data collected by American intelligence agencies, and that added 16 additional government agencies -- 16 additional -- and their employees now gained access to top secret intelligence they never had access to before.  He did this two weeks before he left office. But what we're seeing now is becoming far worse. Now it's a clear and present danger that has emerged and it's threatening our democracy and the will of the people, because we have people in our government today who are committing felonies now on a weekly basis. These saboteurs, they're trying to prevent the president from doing the job that you, the American people, elected him to do. Now, aside from the president's taxes, take a look at this. Look at all the other leaks that have gone on since Donald Trump won the election.  Take a look at all that! Now, this didn't happen when President Obama was in office, but we now have deep state actors, some who broke the law by releasing the president's taxes, all in an effort to destroy his presidency. Now, it wasn't bad enough that Obama used the IRS, remember, as a weapon against conservatives and conservative organizations. They took the criminalization of political differences to a level we've never seen before. Last week, I said that President Trump, he needs to purge this deep state and all these Obama holdovers, all these bureaucrats, all of those sabotaging the president need to be exposed, some arrested and tried and some fired. Now, tonight's example is exactly what I'm talking about. Now, the other issue we've got to address tonight is the corporate jihad being waged by NBC News against President Trump. Now, as I said earlier, they are the leaders of this alt-left propaganda destroy Trump at all costs media, and now releasing his 2005 tax return, it proves that they will do anything, spin any conspiracy to destroy the commander-in-chief, including working with people clearly that have broken the law.

7,HANNITY," All the conspiracies, it's a concerted effort by a so-called news organization. Why? Perhaps to take down the president. Steve Bannon, I argue, was right. The alt-left propaganda media is the opposition party in America today. They're not news anymore. And by the way, did NBC News care when the IRS targeted conservatives specifically to intimidate them? Did they care about President Obama's unconstitutional executive orders he himself admitted he didn't have the power to do? They have this morning show on MSNBC. They attack the president's mental health almost now on daily basis. And what Rachel Maddow did tonight, if you can stomach -- I actually laughed, it actually made me laugh, frankly, harder than I have in 10 years -- was a flat-out pathetic conspiratorial attempt to smear the president. Now, I really couldn't watch it with a straight face. It was sort of like an ""SNL"" skit but actually better. And with her trying to piece all these conspiracy pieces together, claiming in 2005, a Russian oligarch knew that Trump was going to be the president and elected in 2016 so he bought a property from him in Florida and Trump made a big profit and -- you know, do they want to ask the guy who runs NBC, maybe Andy Lack -- I wonder if Andy Lack, he's a pretty wealthy guy, did he sell any property? Did he ever make a profit back into 2005 or any other year? Do they -- do they want to -- you know, do they -- do they want to question if the moon actually -- the moon landing actually occurred? This is ""The Twilight Zone."" Let me get this straight, Russia knew in 2005 that Trump would be president in 2016, but if you watch the tape on election night, even up to the last minute, NBC News didn't think it was possible that Donald Trump would become president. This is ""The Twilight Zone."" So tonight, let's set the record straight. NBC is not news. It is deep state Obama propaganda television.

8,"JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE"," Well, no, I mean, the disclosure of tax return information or the tax return itself from, for instance, an IRS source is a violation of not only the criminal code 7213, but also it's a direct violation of the Internal Revenue manual. I was a lawyer with the office of chief counsel for the Internal Revenue Service.

This is all done according to the tax law.  Big deal. But Jay is right, there' a federal criminal violation here. It's -- clearly, if this was done by the IRS, clearly, if this was done by some tax preparer or legal entity that helped Trump with his taxes -- but it sounds and it seems more like this is someone burrowed into the federal bureaucracy who's trying to make hay of this and trying to capture another news cycle.

23,SEKULOW," The story here is not that Donald Trump paid a lot of taxes, which he did. That's not the story. And I agree with Laura (INAUDIBLE) tax planning -- he wasn't obviously -- he was taking advantage of existing legal doctrine. So that's no big deal. The story, though, is, if this came from -- and it's likely that it came from a source within the IRS or the IRS leaking it to someone else, that is a crime. And this goes back to something we've been talking about a lot.  These -- inside these agencies are these individuals that are so opposed to anything this president does that they would go to this extent to violate the law.

25,HANNITY," All right, the Obamas paid 19 percent effective tax rate in 2015, you know, not 17 years -- you know, not 10 or 11 years ago. But here's my point. There's a bigger issue here because it's almost weekly now that the deep state Obama holdovers that are out there sabotaging -- and what it's doing is -- like, we'll have Sara Carter on later tonight, Laura Ingraham. Sara Carter said that there was a FISA warrant in October. It wasn't against Trump, that when it -- there was any issues that were raised about Trump, they were debunked. But night after night since November 8th, this false narrative keeps getting reported. And this is what they have you believe at NBC tonight, that Donald Trump sold a house to a Russian oligarch in 2005. He made a big profit.",1,761.0,141.0,host,20.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-14

28,INGRAHAM," Yes. The amazing thing, Sean and Jay, is that these are the same folks who are always rushing to conclude that conservatives and conservative activists are conspiracy theorists and total nutbags. But I would argue that they're the real fanatics. The American people have moved on from all of these fake controversies.  They're trying to figure out, OK, am I going to get, you know, health care that I can afford? Will the country started working again? Will government start governing again? And meanwhile, the Democrats are always on yesterday's storyline that's invariably concocted, invariably picked up from dribs and drabs of George Soros-funded media organizations that pose as media Organizations. But there's no there there. And yet they have to keep beating the drum, otherwise what do they do? They talk about how great, you know, our foreign policy was under Obama or how Hillary had all the answers? I mean, we know Russia got more powerful over the last eight years of Barack Obama.

42,HANNITY," You see, they couldn't even figure out on election night that he was the president. They were all depressed about it. But the Russians knew back in 2005. And by the way, just to give you a corporate update, now, in 2015, the Obamas paid about a 19 percent rate. Now, back in 2005 Trump's rate -- what he paid was 25.3 percent, if I'm reading that right. And the Tax Foundation says the top 01 percent pay an average of 22.48 percent. So that would mean that Donald Trump -- that Laura Ingraham is right, that Donald Trump actually paid more and probably needs a new accountant. Laura, so -- all right, Jay, I guess we lost you. Laura -- we lost Laura.  Jay, let me ask you. Let's go back to the legal side of this. Does it matter where it came from, the tax return?",2,766.0,149.0,host,34.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-14

47,SEKULOW," So right now, you -- yes. So right now, you've got a situation where it is a felony under section 7213 and also within the Internal Revenue code manual itself for an employee or a former employee to disclose the return itself or information from the return. And right now, if this came from IRS sources indirectly to the reporter or indirectly through an intermediary, that in and of itself would constitute a crime by those employees or former employees of the IRS. And Sean, right now, I'll tell you this. As someone that's litigated against the IRS and (INAUDIBLE) used to be an IRS lawyer, I think the IRS is institutionally incapable -- institutionally incapable of correcting its wrongdoing here! And again, we don't know exactly where this came from, but the likelihood, just with everything else that's transpired, is someone inside the agency. And here's what I would do from an investigative standpoint. Start with the presumption that this came from inside and do your investigation that way. If it leads elsewhere, so be it, but start with the assumption that this is an inside problem because this should concern every American, Republican, Democrat, independent, libertarian, it does not matter.

You know, these are serious intelligence leaks. Put aside everything else as it relates to Michael Flynn. You know, signet (sic) intelligence never gets leaked.

But I think we all have to look at the fact that there are people within the bureaucracy that feel vehemently that President Trump, and I've talked to sources in the intelligence community and in federal law enforcement that feel that there are people they work with that oppose President Trump being the president.  And that is where we're seeing these leaks come out. And this is very, very dangerous. This is very dangerous to the republic. It's very dangerous to the American people. And it's dangerous to our privacy.

And now the president's son, Donald Trump, Jr., is responding. By the way, thank you, Rachel Maddow, proving to your Trump hating followers how successful President Trump is and that he paid almost $40 million in taxes. Also tonight, The Drudge Report has a headline that Trump paid a higher tax rate than NBC's parent company, Comcast. They also noted it's higher than Obama and Bernie Sanders. Here with reaction, Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp, and Fox News contributor Mercedes Schlapp. I don't even know where to begin here. I guess it's a pretty good thing that he has paid more than Comcast, paid more than Obama, paid more than Bernie. I mean, $38 million in federal taxes alone is an obscene amount of money.

He paid the amount of taxes, I think it was about a 25 percent tax rate. That's more than even Mitt Romney paid. So it just shows that he did his part.

26,HANNITY," Beyond awful. And when the alt-left propaganda media isn't doing what you just saw and attacking the integrity and mental health of the president, well, they're running wild with all kinds of bizarre conspiracy theories about the Trump campaign colluding with the Russians. Now, what the biased press refuses to tell you, there is zero -- no evidence whatsoever that shows any kind of collusion. Well, that didn't stop the leader of the alt-left propaganda media, Rachel Maddow herself, from going off the deep end last night, claiming that in 2005, a Russian oligarch knew that Donald Trump was going to be president, so he bought a property from him in Florida and Trump made a huge profit, more than two times what he paid for it! And as I said last night, Maddow thinks that somehow, maybe Russia knew in 2005 that Donald Trump would be elected president in 2016. Unfortunately, NBC News didn't think that was possible even on election night. Now, that's pretty pathetic, and the media should know better, but they'd rather put their radical left-wing agenda than telling the truth to the American people. That's why they never vetted Obama. That's why they colluded with Hillary. Now, two journalists at Circa News, Sara Carter, John Solomon, who will be here in just a minute, have already debunked this Russia story and conspiracy and the talking points. Now, last week, they reported that the FBI has found no evidence of collusion between Trump and the Russians, just like James Clapper had said. And that's officials that are inside the agency. They are frustrated how it's now being represented by this media that is corrupt. Tonight, they have another bombshell story. Here's the headline. Quote, ""Hillary Clinton supporter pushed Trump-Russia computer narrative investigated by FBI."" Now, according to the report, computer scientist and Indiana University professor L. Jean Camp pushed the theory into the left-wing media that a computer server connected to Donald Trump was communicating with a Russian bank. Now, the FBI did, in fact, look into it. They found nothing to indicate collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Now, it's very important to note that L. Jean Camp has donated, shockingly, thousands of dollars to Hillary Clinton, including $2,200 to her 2016 presidential campaign. She's also donated over $10,000 to Democratic groups and candidates since 2004, including the radical group Moveon.org.   But it doesn't end there. Camp also has a series of social media posts where she advocated for Hillary Clinton. She pushed the Trump-Russia conspiracy connection and talked about joining the quote, ""resistance."" Circa News reached out to Camp for a comment on the story. She confirmed the donations and said her actions regarding the server were not politically motivated. Oh, that's shocking. But once again, the alt left media -- they didn't even bother to look into this! Here now with more, the journalists who broke the story, from Circa News, Sara Carter and John Solomon. Let me ask, John -- I'll start with you. I anybody -- this is pretty blockbuster information. You both have over two decades in the media. And by the way, you're not a member of my right-wing conspiracy. You worked for the AP for 20 years. I doubt I could get a job there, right?",1,3300.0,552.0,host,19.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-15

32,SOLOMON," Yes, they haven't, and of course, at the end of the day, when you do these things, you're more concerned about the facts and what sort of attention or media attention you get. Listen, there are so many things being thrown around Washington right now. And going back to the basics of journalism, I learned a long time ago. Follow the money, follow the politics. And I think when you look at some of these allegations, you start to see a partisan political line and you see a money line. And I think both of those things are very important to keep looking at.",1,558.0,105.0,guest,23.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-15

35,"SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS"," Absolutely! No, no one's reached out to me, either. And just like John, I mean, the most important thing is getting the facts out to the American public and ensuring that we're doing our job and doing our job well by stating those facts. What we discovered here is that Professor L. Jean Camp, who is very partisan and a supporter of Hillary Clinton, who's made donations not just to Hillary Clinton but to groups supporting the Democratic Party, posted on her Web site actually in October these connections, supposedly, between the Trump server and the Russian bank. We know that they were first posted on Reddit. And we did not know by who yet, but we know that it was one of her colleagues, and that they pushed the FBI to investigate this. And the FBI did investigate this and found no collusion whatsoever. In fact, the data that was bouncing back and forth between the Trump server and the Russian bank -- I mean, well, it contained no data. It was pings, and it contained no data. So they didn't find any collusion whatsoever and dropped the case. And like I said before, I mean, the investigation was less than two weeks.  So they didn't spend a lot of time on it and kind of pushed it away.  Although Camp stated to us in her e-mail responses that she wished they had continued the investigation.",1,1306.0,238.0,guest,25.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-15
36,HANNITY," Well, it raises questions, Sara. And before we get John back into this here, why did the FBI listen to a political partisan? And we talked about the FISA warrant and another warrant which I'm suspecting it came from the FBI in some way, shape, manner or form, a criminal investigation, and any ancillary information they got from a Trump server.  There was surveillance on a Trump server from the Trump Tower. Although it's off-site, it's the Trump Tower server. And they found nothing. Why don't they tell the American people this is nonsense and move on?",1,557.0,98.0,host,26.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-15
37,CARTER," I don't know. All I know is that Senator Lindsey Graham has been asking the FBI to make that statement. And he even said today that there's no evidence proving that there's any investigation between Trump and Russia. And he hopes that the FBI director Comey will answer that question. What we know is that Director Comey spoke with Senator Grassley today, as well as Senator Feinstein, and that meeting lasted more than a hour. What they spoke about was classified, and they did not reveal what was spoken about. But one thing that we do know is that coming from our sources, coming from the sources that John and I both spoke with, there is no evidence of any criminality between Trump and the Trump team and Russia to date. And that is a fact.",1,746.0,137.0,guest,27.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-15

39,SOLOMON," Listen, Jean Camp is a well-respected computer researcher. She hung out, as she said, with a bunch of nerds -- that was her term -- and that they discovered these pings. They became fascinated by it and they tried to gain attention from it. I think the most interesting part of her social media is when you look in the last few weeks, she seems to lament that this didn't get more attention and that it might have knocked Donald Trump out of the presidency. And it does go towards her motive. Giving donations to Hillary Clinton, lamenting that the allegations she made didn't knock Trump out of office -- I think those are things that the American public has to take a look at and weigh when they see these...",1,711.0,132.0,guest,29.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-15

43,CARTER," Well, I think we've just reached the tip of the iceberg. But one of the questions that I think really needs to be answered -- it's a question that House Intelligence chairman Nunes posed today. Who unmasked the names of Flynn? Where -- who was looking at this raw data? How many more people in the White House could possibly be exposed by leaks in the future? And what are the regulations regarding those? I mean, these are questions that really need to be answered, and they're very damaging to the national security of this country, as well as to the rights of citizens for privacy.  And I think there's going to be a lot more to this story, Sean.",1,650.0,121.0,guest,33.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-15

That's why I say that purge needs to happen. And I think the U.S. attorneys was only the first step, in my humble opinion. Anyway, thank you both for being with us. We'll follow this investigation.

It's not ideological, it's just out of touch with reality. So let's start with what the president said, which I agree with 100 percent, but it's up to the president and his administration to follow through. It is a felony to release an Internal Revenue Service tax record.  It's punishable by five years’ imprisonment. And they're going to have to start empaneling grand juries and tracking down people who are breaking the law. Let's be clear about this. This isn't about civil disobedience. This isn't about, you know, the public's right to know. There are a set of laws for good, powerful reasons which prevent people from routinely taking government information and giving it out.

This isn't mine, that you create a box and within that box is the answer. And no one is going to get everything they want.",3,390.0,76.0,host,79.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-15
111,GINGRICH," Look, you are right, and I believe in that box. My first point to the Freedom Caucus and others is the box has to include everyone, which makes it harder, not easier. Second, I would say to you, the number one key that I learned from the Army's training in doctrine command way back in 1979 is a very simple set of words -- listen, learn, help, and lead. And the leadership is going to learn in the next few days that they better spend more of their time listening and less of their time lecturing, because it is a free society. You have to get all these folks talking and they have got to sort it out. And they've got to say, well, maybe plan one doesn't work, what about a plan two, a plan three, a plan five, a plan 11? We didn't get the things we got done by locking people in a room and just getting one way or no way. We kept churning and looking and developing.  And we had to learn a lot. Health care is the most complicated thing we will try to do. Ten times more complicated than national security.",3,1009.0,199.0,guest,80.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-15
112,HANNITY," For eight years, and you can even argue since November 8th, they knew what the president's mandate was on this. Of course they are not going to be able to arm twist their way to a successful bill and there's going to build a lot of resentment. I am frustrated and I know many other people are frustrated that they will were not prepared. All of the infighting we see going on on TV and on radio every day and in the papers, shouldn't that have been handled way before they rolled out this bill and most of this taken care of and the consensus built?",3,550.0,107.0,host,81.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-15
113,GINGRICH," In theory, yes. I agree. I once read a fascinating book by a golf teacher who had been Arnie Palmer's roommate at Wake Forest. And he said he and Palmer would go out and they both had bad shots. And all the way to his next shot, he beat himself up for being stupid. All the way up to the next shot. Palmer would look up and go, ""bad shot,"" and that's it.  All the way up he's figuring out how to recover. Guess which guy did better?    So my only point is, we are where we are. You can go back and apportion lots of things. There wasn't a big enough transition team. They weren't prepared to deal with the complexity. Tom Price, who is brilliant and a great doctor and a good congressman, by himself can't be the whole department. The Democrats successfully slowed everything down by at least two months.          So there are lots of places you can look at and say whether it is it Ryan or it's Trump or it's McConnell, it's just where we are in life. The question is, where do we go from here now? I think that we've seen Trump who tonight was very good.",3,1057.0,206.0,guest,82.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-15

133,HANNITY," That was the president earlier tonight talking about all the fake news that we have to get bombarded with pretty much every day. Air Force One, by the way, just landed at Joint Base Andrews. And he has a right to be upset. Why? Because journalism is dead, it died in '08. The alt-left propaganda destroy-Trump media was salivating at the mouth last night, announcing NBC got a hold of Trump's 2005 tax returns. Let's compare and contrast, shall we? Between 2000 and 2015, take a look.  The Obamas paid a whopping $6.1 million in federal taxes, 15 years. Keep in mind, President Trump and the first lady Melania Trump, they paid in one year alone, in 2005, $38 million. By the way, at a higher rate than the Obama's. So President Trump paid more taxes to the government in one year than the Obama stated in 15 years, probably their entire life and then some. Joining us now with reaction from the American Center for Law and Justice Jay Sekulow, and she is the host of ""Full Measure"" and the author of the upcoming book ""The Smear, How Shady Political Operatives and Fake News Control What You See, What You Think, and How you Vote,"" Sharyl Attkisson is with us, former of CBS.

134,"SHARYL ATTKISSON, ""FULL MEASURE"" HOST"," John Solomon has excellent sources and Sara Carter as well. So I don't know the details of their story but I tend to think their reporting is solid. I also think that we are seeing the result of something that has been going on for quite some time. I argue that we have allowed the mainstream news, we've allowed political operatives and corporate operatives to infiltrate our newsrooms by inviting them in not just as pundits and analysts but in some cases by hiring ideologues as reporters who actually serve a narrative's interest rather than necessarily seeking to find the facts.",4,585.0,102.0,guest,96.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-15

136,"JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE"," Yes. It's results- driven. What you have got right now is basically results-driven news.  It's not news based on facts. I'm a lawyer. I deal with facts and I deal with evidence. What you have got right now basically is results oriented.  They have a goal, they want to get to that goal, they will skew the evidence to get there. And I think the perfect example of that was the ridiculous reporting last night on MSNBC. That was absurd. It showed, what, that Donald Trump made a lot of money and paid a lot of taxes? I made the joke, I'm a tax lawyer by training. I could've done a little bit better I think for him. But the fact is at the end of the day, what was it? It was trying to create a story out of nothing. When you don't have a really good set of facts, you argue the law. When you don't have good law, you argue the facts.

140,ATTKISSON," There are all kinds of journalists. There are advocacy journalists and so on. I don't think she would say she is a neutral player. But I think in fairness, once the results were what they were, there should be an obligation to say it for what it is rather than try to portray as the thing that you hoped that it would have been. And I think an even more egregious example is the example of TIME magazine, the reporter that went into the Oval Office the day President Trump was inaugurated and falsely reported as a pool member to the international press that the bust of Martin Luther King had been removed.",4,608.0,114.0,guest,102.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-15

This is the second executive order on extreme vetting by the president. Also not only was Hawaii chosen for that reason but also to go back to the ninth circuit. You believe, though, that this time they got it right, and if it goes to the Supreme Court you're predicting an 8-0, if Neil Gorsuch is confirmed by them, 9-0 decision.",4,480.0,89.0,host,106.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-15
145,SEKULOW," Yes. The basis of the district court judge's opinion in Hawaii is that the extreme vetting on six countries constitutes a violation of the establishment clause of the United States constitution. Now, if that is, if that is fact, if that judge was correct as a matter of law -- I think it is fundamentally flawed, and I think actually this judge has created a constitutional crisis when there was none. And I would take it a step further and quote a justice of the Supreme Court who reminding his colleagues that the constitution is not a suicide pact. And the idea that if you target six particular countries and that now constitutes a violation of, what, the establishment of religion? That would mean that if the United States in the 1940s would have accepted a disproportionate, some would say, number of Jewish people from the Nazi era and gave them access into the United States and showed favoritism that way, and I had relatives that were lost in the holocaust, would that be showing favoritism to Judaism and therefore violating the establishment clause? Well, under this judge's order it would. So this is nonsense, Sean. I think it's unanimous at the Supreme Court. That's where it needs to go. The ninth circuit is going to be a disaster. It's the Supreme Court of the United States, and it needs to get there sooner rather than later.",4,1347.0,238.0,guest,107.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-15

155,HANNITY," That was the president during a sit-down interview with Tucker Carlson, that was earlier today, calling out at the alt left media, the destroy-Trump media, for their dishonest coverage. Last night MSNBC's Rachel Maddow hit an all new low by focusing her show on Trump's 2005 leaked tax return. She actually views herself as a journalist. She recently told the AP, quote, ""People want to draft me as an activist all the time. Describe that role to me. I'm not. The reason I know I am not is that I stopped doing that in order to be the person who explained the news and delivered the news instead. That's a very clear line for me.""  She does think she is a journalist, which is hilarious, but Michelle Malkin of ""Michelle Malkin Investigates"" on CRTV is with us. She's not a journalist. It's not really worthy of a discussion in any way. But this is serious in a lot of ways. What's your reaction to it.",5,903.0,166.0,host,112.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-15

I think that this was a long time in coming, and I'm glad to see that she clowned herself as big as she did. Even many of her allies among the progressive movement on the left were smacking themselves in the forehead after salivating over her hype over the story.    But I think it is worth discussing this very fundamental question about who is a journalist, because if you are some elite liberal from an elite college who gets her pedigree from Oxford and brags about her title as a Rhodes scholar, it doesn't matter that your sole experience as a so- called journalist was as a radio host for bankrupt Air America. I actually committed journalism when I and a good friend of mine, Brian Maloney, did what nobody else would do, certainly not the fish-wrapped record and digging into the finances of that decrepit institution. And yet here is a Rachel Maddow who has been able to fail upward for years and years and call herself a journalist. Anybody can commit journalism.

There is nobody that is watching this show I don't think that thinks that I am a newsperson like a traditional newsman. I am a conservative talk show host.

24,HANNITY," It is an outright dereliction of duty to flat-out ignore what all of these officials are saying, the warnings, the admonitions to us, not to mention the list of countries in this revised travel ban -- it came directly from the Obama administration and Congress, not President Trump. And to the alt-left critics of the ban, I urge them to take a look at Fox News reporting from last week. Here's the headline. ""Iraqi insurgent fighter allegedly lied about identify, got through 'extreme vetting.'"" Now, the investigation into this is still ongoing, but it could show exactly what President Trump and all those top Obama officials had been saying could happen to this country, that terrorists can infiltrate the refugee population coming in here. So tonight, America needs to make a very, very profound choice. Actually, it's very simple on the other hand. Do you want to sacrifice your safety over the fears of slightly inconveniencing a few people? Now, there's nothing wrong with finding out if people who want to come to this country agree with our values, constitutional rights, our principles. In fact, that should be a prerequisite before coming here. Now, it's time to put protecting your life, the life of the American people, over being politically correct. Now, we can't let the left drag us into another pre-9/11 mindset because we've seen what happens when we let our guard down. The 9/11 terror attacks -- well, it could be the only evidence the left needs to see what happens when the country is not being vigilant. 2,996 Americans died that day and over 6,000 others were injured. We saw what happened at the finish line in the Boston Marathon bombing.  Terrorists took the lives of four people including two policemen. They injured 264 of our friends and neighbors. In San Bernardino, California, 2015, jihadist couple slaughtered their co-workers at a holiday party, 14 people dead, 22 others injured. Remember Orlando, the Pulse nightclub in Florida. Radical Islamists savagely attacking people in that club. They killed 49, injured 53 other people. Now, here's the truth. If the alt radical left wants to continue to undermine the president's ability to keep you, the American people safe, and if a single person dies because Trump's extreme vetting policy is being blocked, they will have blood on their hands. They own it! Here now with reaction, the editor of Lifezette, editor-in-chief of Lifezette, Fox News contributor, nationally syndicated radio host, good friend of the program -- this is not a joke because all these instances happened here. If you want to come to America, is it really, really that bad that we're going to check out that you're coming here as a friend, not a foe? Is it really that horrible to do that?",1,2749.0,465.0,host,18.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-16
25,"LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," No, Sean, you hit the nail on the head.  The president's responsibility, supreme responsibility, is to safeguard our independence and freedom, safeguarding our security. And without security, you know, our freedom doesn't mean a lot. You have to have a secure nation. And our framers entrusted the executive, the chief executive, the president with this responsibility. The fact that we have district court judges in Maryland, in Hawaii, in Washington state or Oregon or California or pick your poison, who want to just on their own with a stroke of a pen and a lamely argued opinion, lamely written opinion, want to just wipe all that away -- I mean, I can how really understand why Judge Robert Bork believed it was probably time to circumscribe the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary because it's gotten out of control, completely absurd in these rulings.

31,INGRAHAM," ... of people -- right. Entire classes of people can be excluded from the country if the president sees fit to do that because of any number of considerations. The statute is very clear. The Constitution -- nowhere in the Constitution does it prohibit the president of the United States from doing exactly what he did. And even if this was a Muslim ban -- let's cede it -- OK, let's -- let's cede that issue to the left that -- I don't substantively, but just for the sake of argument. Even that wouldn't be prohibited under our constitutional understanding. That's not what the framers intended. And again, we have activist judges, both of these appointees of Barack Obama -- one of them's entire experience has been in the government, the Maryland judge, which you might already have covered, Sean, was involved in the Benghazi issue. Chuck Grassley urged other Republican senators to vote against his confirmation because he was at the Homeland Security -- the State Department, excuse me, during the Benghazi issue.

36,HANNITY," But they also wanted to go to the ninth circuit. They're overturned about, what, 80 percent of the time, one of the most overturned courts in the country. So it makes it harder -- they have this ability to tie it up. Now, I think it goes to the Supreme Court. Supreme Court I can't imagine is going to go along with this reasoning. What do you think?",1,351.0,69.0,host,30.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-16
37,INGRAHAM," I think you're right. Judge shopping is something that has vexed both Democrat presidents. Donald -- Donald Trump doesn't like it, but neither did Obama like it when the -- you know, the DACA case came up and there was a district court judge in Texas who stopped those work permits from going forward. But again, it goes to -- it goes to the question of the judiciary, Sean.  And I think we all -- we all focus on the executive branch, we focus on the legislative branch, and that's understandable. But right now, there are 90 key vacancies on the federal bench that Jeff Sessions, the Trump administration -- those guys have got to fill those vacancies because there is going to be extreme havoc being wreaked upon the Trump agenda. He's the president of the United States, but extreme havoc, roadblocks, monkey wrenches. There's be frivolous lawsuits filed. Some will be thrown out, some won't be.

This is how they figured this out because in February, there was a hack -- there was a hacking. Then in March, March 11th and March 13th, they were hacked again, but they were able to trace this.

They're now beginning to rethink that, thinking maybe there was a hacker all along, trying to create a political hoax, trying to create the impression that there was something nefarious going on. So take a look at this story's evolution. A week before the election, headlines that Donald Trump has a secret computer connection, a back door way of talking to the Kremlin. Then we find out it's perpetrated by someone or advanced by someone that has a Hillary Clinton sentiment in pushing the story.

The president has made it very clear that he is going to deport criminal illegal aliens and he's going to build a wall. It was one of his key campaign promises. That's not stopping the left and the press from relentlessly attacking the president. As we have shown you, I have personally been down to the border at least a dozen times. I've been on boats. I'm been flying in helicopters, on horseback, all-terrain vehicle.  The horseback was embarrassing but I tried. I've seen warehouses, huge drugs targeted to this country. I also saw tunnels that were drug. I've seen illegal immigrants being detained including one gang member.

This is the president, what other president has talked about drugs as President Trump? None of them have talked about drugs in that way. And focused on the border, he said he's going to build the wall to stop human smuggling, but you also see his great passion in evidence every time he talks about the heroin epidemic in this country because most of that heroin is coming across the border from Mexico, most of methamphetamines, marijuana, cocaine. He is the only one who has had the guts to step and actually say these words, we are going to fight the cartels who smuggled the drugs and human trafficking as well.

139,HANNITY," Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So NBC's Rachel Maddow has taken a lot of heat for her massive viewer letdown the other night when she focused her show on President Trump's 2005 leaked tax return. Now, she's not pointing the finger at herself, no. in an interview with Associated Press, Maddow says, quote, ""Because I have information about the president doesn't mean that it's necessarily a scandal. It doesn't mean that it's damning information. If other people leapt to that conclusion without me indicating that it was, that hype is external to what we did."" So, oh, I get it, it's the viewer's fault that they were let down. Oh, OK. Rachel tweeted this, though, quote, ""Breaking, we've got Trump tax returns tonight, 9:00 p.m. eastern time. Seriously."" And then one of her liberal colleagues, Lawrence O'Donnell, tweeted out, quote, ""Yes, seriously, I will be watching."" And then of course, this is the night we have been waiting for. Sounds like a typical liberal to me. It sounds like Obama blaming George Bush for eight years. Here with reaction, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, former Obama economic adviser Austan Goolsbee. Austan, he paid a higher rate, he paid $38 million in taxes. You are the economic guy. He paid a higher rate than Comcast/NBC, a higher rate than the Obamas at 19 percent. He paid more in that one year, the Obama's paid $6.1 million in 16 years. He deserves a pat on the back. He looks pretty generous to me.",4,1455.0,252.0,host,111.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-16

But in journalism, doesn't matter if you are an advocacy journalist or a liberal journalist like Rachel is, in that sense she is protected. But Corey, that is not the point. I think the bigger point is that here you have -- the fact that they tried to tie this to a 2005 property sale of a Trump property to a Russian oligarch where he more than doubled his money, and somehow the Russians in 2005 knew that he was going to be president, elected in 2016, and take the office in 2017, and somehow they were buying some influence back then?

Good for him.  That's what smart business people do. If the liberals had their way, they would want to be saying he took a loss on the property. The bottom line is he did what is very best for his family, for his business, for all the people who work for him. He paid 25 percent in taxes, an effective tax rate at the federal level, now all of a sudden the liberals don't want to talk about that. They don't want to talk about the fact that Bernie Sanders paid 13 percent effective tax rate, Donald Trump paid 25 percent.  Nobody is now saying Donald Trump isn't really rich anymore.

But first, today's meeting highlighted major differences between Trump and Merkel's approach to key issues.  And America can learn from Europe's many failures.  And that is tonight's ""Opening Monologue."" Now, President Trump and Chancellor Merkel -- they capped off their first visit earlier today by holding a joint press conference.  And President Trump made very clear where we stand on protecting this country.  Watch this.",1,666.0,102.0,host,1.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17

2,"DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES","  Our two countries must continue to work together to protect our people from radical Islamic terrorism and to defeat ISIS.  I applaud Chancellor Merkel for Germany's contributions, both civilian and military, as a counter-ISIS coalition member. We also recognize that immigration security is national security.  We must protect our citizens from those who seek to spread terrorism, extremism and violence inside our borders.  Immigration is a privilege, not a right, and the safety of our citizens must always come first.",1,522.0,81.0,guest,2.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17

4,HANNITY,"  Now, we have been covering in depth on this show how President Trump has promised to do everything within his power to stop radical Islamic terrorists from entering this country and putting you, the American people, in danger.  Now, he plans on doing that in part by enacting extreme vetting of refugees. However, as we told you last night, the alt radical obstructionist left here in America is trying to stop the president.  And by doing so, they are showing that they are perfectly willing to gamble with your lives, the lives of the American people. At this point, in my opinion, the left here at home -- they want to copy Germany and Europe's practice of letting waves of unchecked refugees pour into their countries.  But tonight, the alt radical left -- they may want to think twice about this.  And we'll show you exactly why. Now, here at home, we've seen an increase in radical Islamist attacks.  Top officials have repeatedly warned that ISIS can, in fact, infiltrate the refugee population.  And according to the FBI, there are 1,000 active ISIS- related cases right now in all 50 states. And earlier this month, the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, revealed this shocking statistic about these ongoing investigations.  Take a look.",1,1246.0,212.0,host,3.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17

8,HANNITY,"  And in Europe, it's become far worse and more violent.  Now, the continent has become the epicenter of terrorist attacks against the West. Now, since 2014, Europe has taken in over 3 million refugees and asylum- seekers.  Germany has led the way in Western Europe by accepting nearly 900,000 refugees in 2015 alone. Last month, Germany's domestic security and intelligence agency, the BFV, said the number of radical Islamists in the country has grown considerably, rising from just 100 in 2013 to almost 1,600 this year.  And what we've seen is devastating and brutally violent attacks. Now, in November 2015, radical Islamists -- they launched a series of attacks in Paris targeting a stadium, a cafe, a concert hall where they slaughtered 130 people and wounded hundreds of others.  And then in March of 2016, explosions at the airport and a metro station rocked the city of Brussels.  On that case, 34 killed, and that's 34 innocent travelers, including Americans, 150 injured. And a few months later in the city of Nice in France, during a French national day, a truck attack killed 84 people, including 10 children.  More than 200 others are injured.  And days before Christmas in 2016 in Berlin, Germany, an Islamist plowed a truck into a crowded Christmas market, 12 dead and 50 more injured. Here's the bottom line here.  Liberals in this country can continue to be naive, have a pre-9/11 mindset with the hopes that another major attack is not going to happen.  They can hope, they can pray, or we should be smart and vigilant and fully aware of all these dangers we face and allow President Trump to harden the policies and procedures so we can keep all of you and all of America and all of our children safe. Here now with reaction, the author of the best-selling book ""In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome,"" Ann Coulter.  Ann to me, this comes down to a very simple, basic fundamental choice, the inconvenience of a few guests that want the privilege to be here, the inconvenience, or the gambling with the lives of the American people.  Why is that such a hard decision for people?",1,2098.0,365.0,host,5.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17
9,"ANN COULTER, CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST","  No, and you're right in your monologue.  Why can't we learn from Western Europe?  Just a few weeks ago, German intelligence reports that 1,000 German residents have gone to fight with ISIS.  Hundreds of them have come back to Germany.  And what does Merkel do?  She's setting them up with welfare because, you know, if they don't have a lot of welfare, that could radicalize them. What don't we believe what -- that these migrants say?  They come into countries.  They rape women.  They're having a very difficult time learning not to rape women, even if they're infidel whores and have short skirts. What other immigrant group could not stop itself from raping masses of women? They march around saying, No, you're going to live under sharia law.  They commit terrorist acts.  It's right in front of our eyes.  And can you imagine, I mean, what Angela Merkel has done is spreading throughout Western Europe.  But just in Germany alone, combining German military discipline with Islamic ideology?  It's terrifying what we're up against. Why would you do that in this country?",1,1077.0,182.0,guest,6.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17

12,HANNITY,"  It's six months of a conspiracy lie.  I mean, it's been nonstop. Here's -- here's a really tough question.  I know you'll touch it, but so many are afraid to touch it.  If you grow up under sharia and you're a man and you think you have the right to tell women they can't drive, travel, they've got to dress a certain way, they can't be seen in public without a male relative, if you think you can throw gays and lesbians off of big buildings and kill them or hang them, if you persecute Christians and Jews, how do we know -- how do you ever vet somebody's mind and heart if your culture -- you grew up -- that's what you learned, which that directly contradicts our constitutional values!  How do we vet that?  Is that possible, even?",1,738.0,141.0,host,9.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17
13,COULTER,"  No, you're absolutely right, in addition to the fact that there is no, you know, Syrian FBI.  They don't have a computer database.  And there was testimony before the Senate last year saying there's nothing to vet.  There's nothing we can look at. I also think it's worth mentioning -- maybe you've shown these, and if you haven't, you should.  I tweeted it out a few weeks ago -- photos of women going to college in Afghanistan not that long ago.  It was in the '70s. And they look- it looks like an American college campus.  They're wearing, you know, skirts, and button-down shirts and carrying their book bags. Things can turn overnight.  When you're bringing in these masses of people from very, very different cultures and make it a hate crime to ask them to assimilate, you know, for the cherry on top, and -- and they have no intent of assimilating. Plus which, what are we getting out of this?  It's one thing if we're bringing in nuclear scientists or engineers.  I don't think we're getting a lot of those.  But the vast majority of refugees are just instantly coming in, sucking up welfare that's meant for our people!",1,1132.0,202.0,guest,10.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17
14,HANNITY,"  Yes.  Let me ask you a political question.  One of my favorite clips of the snowflake left is -- you were on your buddy, Bill Maher's, show.  And it's, like, June or July of 2015, and you say, yes, Donald Trump has the best chance of winning, and the crowd just is laughing at you.  I don't think they're laughing now. So you've been a very strong supporter.  I'm pretty angry with the Republican Party.  They seem ill prepared, especially on repeal and replace, and it seems like the president is trying to clean it up. Hopefully, they get there.  Hopefully, we get consensus.  Are you happy with how things are going so far?",1,628.0,115.0,host,11.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17
15,COULTER,"  On most things, I'm disappointed with the Republican Congress. First of all, they ought to be impeaching those two travel ban judges immediately.  It is totally outrageous.  It is against the Constitution. The president -- and by the way, every member of Congress took an oath to uphold the Constitution.  The commander-in-chief has authority over immigration.  He has full authority not only through the Constitution and (INAUDIBLE) duties as commander-in-chief, but through a federal law passed by Congress that's been on the books and reaffirmed in hundreds of Supreme Court cases -- or rather court cases, at least a dozen Supreme Court cases. This is 100 percent the prerogative of the commander-in-chief. And to have a district court judge stepping in and saying, Oh, no, the commander-in-chief doesn't have that duty -- what else -- could a district court just say, Oh, no, we're overruling your decision to go to war because, you know, someone in Hawaii could be affected. This is what we need Congress doing.  I was hoping for a better repeal of ObamaCare.

99,HANNITY,"  All right, that was President Trump in Nashville earlier this week promising to secure the southern border and finally build the wall. Meanwhile, President Trump's proposed budget takes aim at sanctuary cities. The LA Times described this budgetary proposal.  They wrote, quote, ""Trump wants to slash $210 million in federal reimbursements to state and local jails that hold illegal immigrants convicted of crimes while in the country illegally."" Joining us now with reaction, author of, ""Cop Under Fire: Moving Beyond Hashtags of Race, Crime and Politics for a Better America,"" Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, Fox News correspondent at large Geraldo Rivera. Geraldo, you and I go back and forth on this.  And you know, every time I point out to you -- I sat there with all these local law enforcement guys in Texas, and there were 642,000 crimes in a seven-year period committed against Texans alone, including murder, including murder, including drugs, including kidnapping.

111,CLARKE,"  Is a lot of posturing going on right now, but I think in the end cooler heads will prevail. Is there any buddy who thinks Donald Trump is not serious about building this wall, sealing that border for real, to stop the flow of illegal immigrants into this country, the drugs, the weapons, so on and so far, the criminal gangs, the cartels.  He is going to get this done.  I know he is. And I'm going to help him do it as it relates to Milwaukee which is why I sent a letter of intent last week to the acting director of ICE asking to be certified to participate in the 287-G program which will give after training and some other certification will give my deputies, the corrections officers in the jail, the authority after he deputizes U.S. marshals says, to enforce immigration.   What we are talking about here, and I want to make this clear, and it sounds like my good friend Geraldo is starting to soften a little bit on this, and that's a good thing.  We are talking about, in my case, criminal illegal aliens.  We are not talking about doing home raids and business raids to look for people in the country illegally.  We are going to identify people who have been convicted of serious crimes in this country and schedule them for deportation.  That is not extreme.  That is reasonable.  And anybody who is not for that is advocating for criminal behavior, because sanctuary cities provide a safe haven for criminal activity and criminal illegal aliens.  ",3,1462.0,265.0,guest,85.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17
112,RIVERA,"  I totally disagree with that, because nothing prevents cops from enforcing the law.  If someone commits a crime, they get arrested.  What this is all about is whether that top vows to hold the person after the arrest after their sentence is served or they have been acquitted, just hold them for a federal immigration hold.  Over 350 municipalities and states have said no, we're not going to do this.  We are not immigration officials.  We refuse to cooperate.  This is not about law enforcement. This is only about whether county or municipal cops are also federal deputies in that sense enforcing immigration laws.  That's apart from the criminal which of course they have to enforce.  ",3,691.0,118.0,guest,86.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17

114,CLARKE,"  They can't make local jails and sheriffs and chiefs hold these individuals.  They are asking for some cooperation in assisting them in doing that, and I don't think that's a big thing to do.  Had the San Francisco jail area kept or held onto the guy that killed Kate Steinle, she would be alive today.  What Donald Trump, President Trump has made clear, the catch and release days are over.  That's what we're talking about. You're right, Geraldo.  They can't force the jails to do it.  But there will be some penalties.  You talk about the type of dollars we are talking about, that is going to leave some huge gaps in some of these local funding and eventually they are going to start to do the right thing.  They will, trust me on this.  ",3,743.0,137.0,guest,88.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17

122,HANNITY,"  Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Now journalists Sara Carter and John Solomon of Circa News, they have been breaking many big stories this week. According to their first bombshell report, a computer scientist who is a Hillary Clinton donor pushed the Trump-Russia server narrative which eventually of course led to an investigation by the FBI.  They found no wrongdoing.   And just yesterday Sara and John reported that sources told them that Russian Alpha Bank which allegedly had this computer connection to the Trump Organization, asked the Department of Justice for help to identify a computer in the U.S. that they believe is being hacked to make it look like communication exists between the president and Moscow.   Sara Carter joins us now.  I said this to you last night.  This is now becoming more like a new addition of ""Homeland"" every single day with these new developments.  But what they are saying on the Russian side of things it is they've able to trace back -- there is someone they think within the United States that is faking a relationship -- a computer relationship between that bank and at the Trump.  Do we know if this was the same thing going on and investigated in October?  ",4,1199.0,208.0,host,92.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17
123,"SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS","  They suspect that it was.  That's very interesting because even back in October, they were very concerned about this.  Although there was no data going between the two servers, there were still concerns that it happened.   So what they did was they basically intercepted -- they put something inside their computer server and order to track and trace if it happened again.  And it did.  It happened again in February and then it happened again March 11th and March 13th.  And that point, Alpha Bank, their cyber experts, their specialists were able to trace it, and that's where they collected all the data and the information which we were able to view as well, Sean.  So we were able to see that for ourselves.  ",4,716.0,127.0,guest,93.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17
124,HANNITY,"  So all of you are reporting on discoveries, you were able to confirm that in fact, Trump's servers were surveilled.  You were able to confirm that law enforcement found no collusion whatsoever even though it keeps getting reported, this conspiracy by almost everybody else in the media. Where is this going next, because if that is the case, is it possible the whole thing could have been set up by people connected to the Democratic Party?  Can it get that deep?  ",4,467.0,83.0,host,94.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17
125,CARTER,"  It could.  We don't know yet, right.  We're still looking, we're still investigating.  I know one of the things that I am most concerned about is something as well that the House chairman of the intelligence committee is most concerned about is the leaks, right, because that's going to answer a lot of our questions.  Why was General Glynn, Lieutenant General Flynn's name exposed in those phone calls?  Did they have a backdoor through surveillance?   One of the questions, Sean, that nobody is really asking is -- and I think Chairman Nunes will ask these questions of FBI Director Comey as well as others in the NSA and the CIS, was there an increase of viewership of this raw data during December?  Were people going into these skiffs and looking at raw data that had names of persons associated to Trump or President Trump himself?  I think that's something they are going to be asking.  ",4,896.0,158.0,guest,95.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17
126,HANNITY,"  I had Pete Hoekstra on my radio show today, and he's a former chair of the intelligence committee, and he wrote a column in the ""Wall Street Journal,"" can Americans trust their intelligence community?  I would argue probably 99.9 percent, yes, we can.  I have a lot of faith and a lot of -- I just believe that these are people serving their country.  But you only need one bad apple.  Is it possible based on the WikiLeaks revelation that the malware exists that they could literally hack into something from any country and pin it on another country?  In other words --",4,573.0,104.0,host,96.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17
127,CARTER,"  Sure.  They said they can.  That's what we saw.  If those documents are true, then yes, they can.  I suspect that we have some very, very smart people in our intelligence community.  What I think is most concerning is they don't even have to go that far.  If you have FISA records on foreign surveillance, so you're looking at foreigners, any telephone calls then candidate Trump, now President Trump, made it back then, would have been picked up, right?  Could someone have viewed those? Anyone else and his team, could those have been viewed?  How many Americans are being surveilled that make phone calls overseas?  These are the questions that we have to ask. And why weren't those names protected?  Why was the raw data so exposed that it leaked to the press and revealed the name of an American speaking to a Russian ambassador on what is a very classified document, Sean?  I don't know how much I can stress this -- every intelligent source that I speak with says that this is such highly classified document.  And is there an investigation?  ",4,1052.0,185.0,guest,97.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17

129,CARTER,"  I would say based on my reporting, based on the sources that I've spoken with, not any GS-9 would be able to go in there and see these particular types of documents.  These documents would have to be signed off.  They would literally have to be signed off by that director of the FBI or the head of the CIA.  Nobody can just walk in there and just look at these despite the expansion of the 12333.  ",4,401.0,79.0,guest,99.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17

And we won because we had so many Reagan Democrats, so many union guys in the Midwest come over to Donald Trump.  I think that he's onto something here, that we haven't been able to be very successful when it comes to trade deals because we have always put American businesses at a disadvantage when they are trying to go up against other companies from around the world.   So Donald Trump is onto something.  He is a businessman.  He's recognizing the fact that our workers have not been at the forefront and he is putting them there.  ",5,701.0,130.0,guest,109.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17

I think it should have been a consensus bill from the get-go.  Not easy, but putting that aside for just a second, I think Ric is onto something because I call this the forgotten man and woman election.   But it's really going to be the economic plan to me, allowing trillions of multinational corporate money to be repatriated at a low tax rate, dropping the corporate tax rate from the highest in the industrialized world to the lowest, and of course energy, that's going to be a big component of economic growth, that's going to bring back a lot of the jobs that I think everyone is hoping for.  If it comes down to it, is it dangerous to have a trade war?  It is wrong to demand free and fair trade?  ",5,846.0,160.0,host,110.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-17

None. Zero. Zip. Now, instead, the only thing they can focus on is the FBI director saying that he has not seen evidence to support President Trump's tweets about wiretapping. Now, here's the same hypocritical media that used the words ""wiretapping"" in their own reporting! Remember this headline from The New York times, January 20th? Quote, ""Wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides.""  Oh. The New York Times -- are they going to apologize? Now, while the Democrats feign moral outrage, they are missing the real scandal here. Laws, in fact, were broken.

Now, every one of these are criminal acts, felonies that are being committed. That does not seem to bother the Democrats in any way, shape, manner or form.

84,HANNITY," This is a Fox News Alert. Air Force One has just arrived at Joint Base Andrews. President Trump is traveling back from his rally in Kentucky. Joining us now with more, counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway. I want to stay on this issue and how wrong the media has it in so many different ways. We've been reporting everything with John Solomon and Sara Carter for two weeks. You heard my opening monologue. What is your reaction to it?",2,442.0,81.0,host,66.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20
85,"KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT"," I thought today showed the best contrast of all, Sean. You have an eight-month-long investigation on Russia, Russia, Russia with nothing to show for it, and Donald Trump in office for just two months with so much to show for it. He just had his rally in Louisville, Kentucky, promising to make good on uprooting and repealing and replacing the most intrusive, invasive, expensive and expansive law, entitlement that we've had in -- in generations. And he's making good on that promise just this week by negotiating, by listening, by improving and making progress on the bill with leaders in the House and Senate, and of course, our governors who control the Medicaid dollars. And so I think the contrast is really remarkable. I love the way President Trump defied all the negative noise inside the Beltway by going to Kentucky and putting a very positive, optimistic message out there for all to see. The positive optimistic message that he delivered in Louisville tonight really matches the market, the stock market, the consumer confidence, a 12-year high in confidence among home builders, according to a report last week. And so he matches a lot of the mood of this country that's not being reflected, it's not being covered because it's negative, negative, negative. But look, I mean, the unmasking of an American citizen through these intelligence leaks should concern everyone. I think we learned about that today. And you know, again, I would just repeat, we've had eight months, and I'm not sure...",2,1508.0,254.0,guest,67.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20

88,HANNITY," I know he had a really good meeting and he was able to win over through some of the changes he negotiated with the Republican Study Committee. I spoke earlier tonight to some of the members of the Freedom Caucus. They're not there yet. They would have enough votes to stop it in the House. Senator Paul, a few other senators on their side, they want more changes. The president wants a vote by Thursday, or Paul Ryan, who we'll to in a minute, wants a vote by Thursday. You convinced that'll get done.",2,502.0,95.0,host,70.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20
89,CONWAY," Yes, the president and vice president have really leaned in on this, and they're confident that will get the votes. And as you just intimated, some changes have been made to the legislation.",2,191.0,34.0,guest,71.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20
90,HANNITY," Even tonight, yes.",2,19.0,4.0,host,72.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20
91,CONWAY," That's what leaders do. That's right, they listen, they negotiate, they find out what's in the best interests of everyone and what's possible. And some things can change. Some things can't, frankly. But the president made a really good point tonight in his rally in Louisville, Sean. He talked about this Thursday getting the health care repeal and replacement done, getting that vote in the House. And then he said we're going to move on to taxes (ph) (INAUDIBLE) and then we're going to tackle drug pricing.  And the president's own words tonight were, Some people say getting the cost of drugs down and medicines is just as important as tackling health care altogether because this is really something we hear from people all over the country. It's just damaging the everyday affordability of life.",2,802.0,136.0,guest,73.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20
92,HANNITY, You know...,2,12.0,3.0,host,74.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20
93,CONWAY, And it's why people found the original Affordable Care Act was neither affordable nor sustainable.,2,99.0,16.0,guest,75.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20
94,HANNITY," The two solutions that make the most sense to me, number one, medical savings accounts, which I've advocated for years. And the second -- I keep putting this guy from Wichita, Kansas, on radio and TV. His name is Dr. John Unger (ph), ATLAS (ph) MD, $50 an month for adults, unlimited care, concierge care 10 bucks a month for a child. He negotiates directly with the pharmaceuticals, 95 percent discount, literally a 98 percent discount for X-rays, MRIs, every procedure, broken legs, stitches, all taken care of. Add a catastrophic plan, semi-high deductible, and you're fully covered. God forbid you get cancer, heart attack or a bad accident. That is so simple in so many ways. Is that all going to be in this bill by Thursday? That's what I want to know.",2,759.0,135.0,host,76.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20
95,CONWAY," The president as a non-politician who appreciates free market solutions, private solutions, listens to accounts like that. That's the whole point here is that when you have top-down government-run health care, that people are forced to purchase, Sean, or pay a penalty, a tax essentially, you don't even listen to examples like the one you just related and relate regularly to your audience. There are so many great best practices out there in the free market, and this president is somebody who's is listening to that and putting it in there. But people feel -- we feel confident. I was up on Capitol Hill tonight with our director of legislative affairs, Mark Shore (ph). We met with members of the Republican conference, folks who are on Capitol Hill constantly. People are over to the White House, as you know. They're working the phones. So this is a very collaborative process. And it's one that I think you really see the leadership of the president and the vice president where they did not delegate or abdicate the details to anyone else. They've been fully involved, along with Speaker Ryan, and of course, Leader McConnell and the leadership in both chambers.",2,1171.0,200.0,guest,77.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20
96,HANNITY," I got to tell you -- and Dr. Unger in his case, he was able to duplicate this in 1,000 other practices around the country. And there's so many new paradigms that'll emerge, it'll will be fascinating to see that change for the better for people that now can afford health care and have a better plan, and competition will do that. Kellyanne, we love having you.  Good to see you. Thanks for being with us.",2,405.0,77.0,host,78.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20

112,HANNITY," All right, so you want a vote -- we expect a vote Thursday on the health care bill. And I saw progress, a lot of progress on Friday. Let's start with the good news. And for, example, the White House, they -- for example, the option to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients, block grant Medicaid -- I know that was important to the Freedom Caucus members, and also the measure, which I think is interesting, is that the White House and House leaders are also eying increasing the tax credits. Some people don't like that aspect of it. Where do you stand now? Do you think you have the votes right now to pass this bill?",3,629.0,118.0,host,89.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20
113,RYAN," Yes, I feel very good because what we've been doing this entire process, Sean, is listening to our members, finding out where the consensus is and making improvements to the bill as we've gone through the legislative process. As you know it's a four-committee process. In the budget committee, there was an effort to say let's look at work requirements. Let's look at even more federalism for Medicaid something very important to conservatives. There already is a per capita block grant, but some governors are saying let me just take the whole thing in a block grant, and that is what conservatives were asking for as well. And that is something we figure we could get this bill to do. We always have to make sure that every change we make conforms to the Senate rules which we have to play by to make sure that it can't get filibustered. So that's what we've been doing. So all these changes that have been added we're doing to make sure they are done in such a way that it can't get filibustered. And we feel really good where we are. So a lot of members have brought a lot of good ideas to the table. And you mentioned last one. That's something that's also important to the president. The president has said let's see if we can add to the people who are getting assistance who don't get health care from their job, who are older, maybe in their 50s or their 60s, to make sure they are in a good place as well. So we are doing even more assistance there, more federalism, work requirements for Medicaid for able-bodied people. So these are the kinds of things that get Republicans in a good place. We feel very good. Our members have been working really hard at this, and we realize that this is coming to a point. The president is going to do something in Kentucky tonight. He is coming to talk to us tomorrow morning to give sort of a rally to remember to get this done, because we all promised this. We all said we would repeal and replace ObamaCare, if you give us a Republican president, a Republican House, a Republican Senate.  We have that now, and we're working very closely with the administration. I have to tell you, Sean, I'm really, really impressed with the president himself, rolling up his sleeves, getting involved, listening to members, brokering compromises, getting us on the same page and getting to this place. So I feel very good at where we are. And we're going to move this to the House, and then go take it on to the Senate.",3,2456.0,451.0,guest,90.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20
114,HANNITY, Why so much emphasis put on the CBO? The said ObamaCre would have 24 million enrolled people. They have 11. It almost seems like an effort in futility to keep going back to them when they are so wrong so often.,3,211.0,42.0,host,91.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20
115,RYAN," It is all about the filibuster, Sean. It's all about the way that the Senate law works with the budget act which says this score as scored by the CBO must meet what we call reconciliation instructions. And so to conform with the Senate rules to be able to reconcile this bill and block a Chuck Schumer filibuster, you've got to have a CBO score. That's how it works, and those are the rules we are playing by. Those are the rules that they are.",3,445.0,86.0,guest,92.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20
116,HANNITY," Let me move on. You saw the hearings today with James Comey. To me, the big news that came out of this is both Comey and Admiral Rogers both confirmed what James Clapper had said, and that is, OK, there is no evidence that any votes were altered or shifted or changed in any of the swing states that mattered in this election. The media is not focused on that that. But we had reporters on this program, John Solomon and Sara Carter, they are both saying in fact there was surveillance of the server at Trump Tower, there was a FISA warrant about the overall Russia investigation, not about Trump. And while he is willing to admit one investigation is going on he is going to willing to admit another in terms of leaking. He says it's common practice, we don't acknowledge that. Is that troubling to you?",3,805.0,150.0,host,93.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20
117,RYAN," Well, look, that is why we have an intelligence community investigation. So the point is the president asked for this, and we already had an intelligence community investigation going on before all of this. And so that is why I think Chairman Nunes and his ranking member and Chairman Burr over in the Senate and his ranking member are going to see to the bottom of this and get through everything all Russia related. I didn't watch the hearing because I've been busy doing my job, but I had briefings from Comey. I don't think we learned anything new here, and it only confirmed what we have been saying all along. But at the end of the day we will get to the bottom of all of the stuff, the question you just raised, with the intelligence committee -- the investigation that's ongoing.",3,788.0,144.0,guest,94.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20
118,HANNITY," Last question, back to health care, is the Freedom Caucus on board? Have you talked to them, because Dave Brat earlier today said 40 members were not going to vote for the bill and Rand Paul said the same?",3,206.0,40.0,host,95.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20
119,RYAN," I've spoken with many of them. I haven't spoken to every one of them. I talked to a lot of numbers. We've got 230 some members here. But the Freedom Caucus members that have had this vote in committee have already voted for it. One of the ones that didn't vote for it in the budget committee has now come out in favor of it since then. So we've had Freedom Caucus members already voting for it in committee, and one of them who didn't is now in favor of it because of the work requirements, because of the additional layers of federalism. So I've spoken with a lot of Freedom Caucus members who are voting for it. We also had the largest conservative caucus here. The Republican study committee, that's the biggest conservative caucus we have in Congress.  Their leader and their key members came out in favor of it with President Trump in the Oval Office on Friday. And so we are making tremendous progress, we feel very good, and it is because we have been negotiating and listening to one another, improving this bill, making refinements to it so that we can get to the sweet spot of a consensus bill that can pass. The key it doesn't make any difference if you can't repeal and replace it if you can't pass. So we're getting a bill that can pass that repeals and replaces ObamaCare. And this is just one piece of the three things were going to do.",3,1352.0,253.0,guest,96.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20

121,RYAN," The bill in the Senate will be similar, but we want them to improve it if we can. Because their rules are a little different once it gets over there, so if senators can make improvements to this bill without jeopardizing what we call the Byrd rule, meaning a filibuster, that's great. We want them to improve this bill if they can.",3,332.0,63.0,guest,98.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-20

So when are they going to come up and say we disapprove of you because of the last 10 years? They have to be very specific instead of these very nebulous things. When you have the far left that are coming out and saying any of the Democrats that support him going, we're going to primary you, well, look, if they get in the way and become such judicial obstacles in everything for this president to get this Supreme Court nominee through, guess what is going to happen to them in 2018?

It's very, very impressive. I will, however, caution a lot of the Republicans out there when I hear this expression, ""drain the swamp."" You see, Sean, the reason for the presence of the swamp creatures is the presence of the swamp. And the swamp is about government having its hand and fingers in everything. And so if you are, for example, involved in the health care industry and the government has decided we are going to have a plan where everyone can get coverage, then you have a fiduciary obligation to try to interfere with the legislation so it helps you. So you have the pharmaceutical people, from the medical manufacturing people, nurses association, hospital association, doctors association, all of whom are going to lobby. That's what the swamp is all about. So Donald Trump wants to drain the swamp, he has to reduce substantially the size of government and get government out of all the things that it is involved in.

What this president has said is he's going to put a premium on the defense industry and making sure our military has all the resources they need to be successful. And look, this is a very different mindset from the previous administration. We're going to make sure that we're the greatest military power that the world has ever seen. We're going to make sure that our government is no longer punitive. We're going to make sure that those government agencies which have been going after small businesses time and time again have their budgets reduced so that we can make sure the individuals who need the resources have those resources.

Now, whether it's building a border wall, ending sanctuary cities or the deportation of violent criminal illegal immigrants, any action to restore law and order must be swift because American lives are being lost and are at risk.

Now, this was at a high school in Maryland. Now, despite their age, the pair of alleged rapists were attending high school as 9th graders. They're here illegally, at least one of them. So this terrible crime is just the latest in a long list of Americans who are victims because of illegal immigration. Now, during the presidential election, the murder of Kate Steinle became, well, national news. Why? Because in 2015, she was murdered in the sanctuary city of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times. We're not protecting the American people.

We're talking about this anti-detainer policy that many of these sanctuary cities adhere to, where they will not hang onto individuals until ICE can get the paperwork together and the case together to schedule them for deportation. That's not asking a lot just to hang onto them. These things are avoidable. I heard about that rape case, that young 14- year-old girl, these subhuman creeps. And the thing that angered me is one of those guys was out awaiting a deportation hearing. That's why I said these anti-detainer policies -- we don't need to change the law. We're not asking local officials -- ICE anyway, is not asking local officials to enforce immigration. They're just talking -- asking them to honor a detainer, a lawful piece of paper that says, Hold onto this individual until we can get the deportation scheduled. These things are killing communities.

And when ICE has given me a detainer for the last eight years under Obama, I have honored that detainer. These guys are career criminals. You put them back out -- you mentioned Kate Steinle -- only to go out and re-victimize other people. I don't know how any law enforcement official or public official or mayor or governor can sit back with a straight face and say our communities are stronger because of illegal immigration.

That's their history. Now, despite the judge's stellar record on the bench, the Democrats are still angry over the election results which led to Gorsuch's nomination. Now, the left -- they're perfectly willing to use dirty, disgraceful political tactics all to try and derail a Republican Supreme Court nominee.  This is nothing new, and history points this out. Now, for example, look at Judge Robert Bork. Back in 1987, he was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan.

70,HANNITY," All right, Democrats, they proved time and time again they will stoop to new lows to get anything they want. Now, Judge Gorsuch and Republicans, you better be ready for a knock-down, drag-out fight from the left because that's how they roll. Joining us with reaction, from the American Center for Law and Justice, Jay Sekulow, and one of the people who advised President Trump on his Supreme Court decision, Leonard Leo. Leonard, let's start with you. You know judge Gorsuch, and I know that Jay argued in front of Judge Gorsuch. He showed a lot of great humor today, great knowledge of the law, a terrific scholar. Clearly, he was approved unanimously back, you know, when he got onto the 10th circuit. I didn't think they laid a glove on him, and I thought he handled it really well today, but I wouldn't expect that's going to be the case by the end of this. LEONARD LEO, ADVISER TO PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THE SUPREME COURT I agree. You know, if Senate Democrats aren't going to give President Trump 60 votes for Judge Neil Gorsuch, then frankly, Sean, there isn't any Republican Supreme Court nominee they'll ever support because today's performance by Judge Gorsuch was absolutely flawless. And he stuck to his guns. You know, he understands the proper role of a judge. And he's not going to make commitments or promises to Democrats on all the sacred cow issues that they care about and that they need the courts for. And that's really what today's hearing was all about, him constantly being pressed on those issues.",2,1520.0,268.0,host,47.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-21
71,HANNITY," You know, here's what I expect, Jay. And I've spent a lot of time taking a deep dive in my mind on this. Republicans are way -- they play way too fair -- Elena Kagan, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor -- they knew they were going to be left-wing activists on the court. They allowed an up or down vote. As far as I'm concerned, they might as well just end the filibuster rule anyway now, use the nuclear option, end it, because if Democrats -- you know, if they don't use it on this nominee, they will use it on the next nominee, period, end of sentence. So what's the point? They -- liberals get every justice they want. Republicans cave. So why don't they just now fight the way the Democrats do?",2,704.0,135.0,host,48.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-21
72,"JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE"," Because, you know, here's what happens. I mean, and you're right. The fact is that Republicans will say, I don't agree with this person's judicial philosophy, that's not the question, it's whether they're qualified or not. In a perfect world, that would be wonderful. We don't live in the perfect world. Two things. One, Judge Gorsuch will be Justice Gorsuch in a few weeks, whether it is the nuclear option or any other device that they have to utilize to get it done. This is someone who showed himself again today not only eminently qualified, as the ABA recognized, but also despite three attempts by Senator Leahy -- three times he tried to get Judge Gorsuch to say how he would rule in the executive order case involving refugee asylums, knowing full well that that case is likely to go before the Supreme Court and before Judge Gorsuch, who would then be Justice Gorsuch.  And the judge was correct in saying, I'm not going to tell you how I'm going to rule in a case. But that shows you where they wanted to go. They want to know that ruling.  The want to know the decision. But the Republicans are going to have to make sure that this nominee is confirmed, Sean, no matter what has to be utilized, whether it's the nuclear option, which, let's face it, the Democrats have already opened that door.

76,LEO," Absolutely, Sean. There are a couple of things you can see in Judge Gorsuch's work that makes that clear. First of all, he's participated in over 2,600 cases. He's got over 700 opinions. You see two really important things in his opinions. First, you see a real deep commitment to applying the law as it's written -- text, history and structure. And you see that consistently an opinion after opinion. But even more importantly than that, Sean, what you see in a lot of his opinions is a real dedication to enforcing the structural limits on government power contained in our Constitution.",2,590.0,103.0,guest,53.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-21

Joining me now, editor in chief of Lifezette, Fox News contributor, a hugely successful national syndicated radio host, Laura Ingraham is back with us. So they definitely made progress. Tom Price said this is a three-step process. And then of course it's got to go to the Senate. Then it's going to come back and they're going to get into conference together. All right, so the Freedom Conference guys said they want two things to get on board otherwise they have 35 or so members against, repeal the ObamaCare mandates, and essential health benefits, and then they said the rest they can go along with, with the understanding that the Health and Human Services secretary has the authority on his own and to do a lot of the things that they specifically asked for on their wish list.

This is last- minute bargaining I think you're seeing going on, Sean. And I do think that as we're watching this play out, its brinksmanship right to the end.  When either joking or half-serious, Donald Trump says you guys are going to lose your seats, some of those guys on Capitol Hill took it as an implicit threat, like you don't support me, I'm not good to help you, I'm not going to campaign for you. So it's a little disturbing that this early on in the administration the Trump folks have to resort to the arm-twisting. That's what happens, but it doesn't usually happen this early in the administration, so that's a little concerning. I think better groundwork could have been done on the health care bill by the Ryan people in the White House to get this to really where it was supposed to be, a full repeal and at the same time a full replace, which is not what's happening.",4,968.0,180.0,guest,58.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-21
87,HANNITY," Look, I have talked to every side on this, even the 2015 bill that I know a lot of the Freedom Caucus members wanted, that was not a full repeal in essence. It was more than what we have. This will not be. And it all comes back to reconciliation, the way the bill was passed, the way they have to work within it in the Senate. I understand all of those things. The more important issue to me is as we get to phase two and three, get to the Senate, then we get into conference, nobody will know for a long time with this bill is going to look like because the Senate doesn't take it up until next week, and that's frustrating for those of us that are trying to understand it.",4,675.0,136.0,host,59.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-21
88,INGRAHAM," And I think the phase three, certainly as I understand it and as Tom Cotton has explained it, that's kind of a pipe dream. The idea that phase three is going to garner 60 votes, if that's the case where you're going to have across state lines and you're going to break the anti- competitive behavior of all these drug companies, health care companies, you're going to bring prices down with real competition, if you have the votes to do it now, then just do a simultaneous repeal bill as you -- a replace bill as you repeal the other legislation. You know what I'm saying? If phase three is going to happen, then do it now and push the Democrats to the wall on that competitiveness issue, which I think you can break the Democrats your way with enough public pressure that I think could be brought to bear.

This has to be done. We'll work around the edges with you on the replacement bill, but this repeal has to happen and we're going to immediately have a two year phase in period.

117,HANNITY," I'm thinking it's hilarious because it's the media that said of Trump Tower was wiretapped. The media said all that. All those guys say it doesn't impact the election. They said they've hacked us and tried to influence past elections, about trying to influence the 2018 election, the 2020 election. Why is the media obsessed about this with no evidence for eight months?",5,371.0,64.0,host,86.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-21
118,INGRAHAM," They were hoping this was going to be the smoking gun, as Maxine Waters tweeted yesterday, I think it was yesterday, ""Get ready, we're one step closer to impeachment."" It's just the most ridiculous commentary and breathless reporting from the media, Sean, who are desperate to try to find some Russian web of spies working with, I don't know, just pick your Trump staffer. And nothing has come to the fore. The big reveal yesterday was something Trump already conceded in that Tucker Carlson interview when he said The New York Times is reporting that some of my former associates or aides had been surveilled. What did Comey say? I have no knowledge of any wiretaps of Trump Tower, and none of the other intelligence agencies do either. That was the big get from yesterday's hearing? I just thought it was a big nothing.",5,822.0,145.0,guest,87.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-21
119,HANNITY," But it's even deeper than that. We have been reporting this for two weeks, you know this because you've been on and watching Sara Carter and John Solomon. They said yes -- they didn't say ""wiretapping."" Now, are we playing word games? Is the FBI director playing word games? Not wiretapped. But was their surveillance? Were there two warrants? Was the Trump server surveilled, the Trump Tower server surveilled? The answer appears to be yes. And as an ancillary look at the pings from a Russian bank, big deal. And you would think they are allowing this conspiracy theory, the media, to go on for another year, another eight months? When do they say definitively nothing happened?",5,681.0,118.0,host,88.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-21
120,INGRAHAM," It certainly does lend belief to this idea that intelligence has become in some circles really politicized. The real shocker is that in a hotly contested election year, the FBI director was briefing the president of the United States on an ongoing investigation involving an opposition candidate. And we don't really know what happened at that briefing. He wouldn't go into that yesterday. But it was very strange that the president gets briefed but the congressional leaders weren't briefed until yesterday or the day before yesterday.",5,537.0,87.0,guest,89.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-21

122,INGRAHAM," Exactly. But he would not answer those questions because earlier in the interview, in the hearing, he said, well, regularly we inform the White House and the other intelligence agencies and the Congressional, the gang of eight in the intelligence committee, we regularly apprise them of counter-intel investigations like this on a quarterly basis. If it started last July, why is it taking formal basis until now for them to have revealed it? It's very curious. I thought he got really squirrelly when that Albany congresswoman asked him about that.",5,550.0,91.0,guest,91.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-21
123,HANNITY," I think when we get to the end of this we're going to find a lot of politics, and I think you're right. I think probably a lot of people not only in the intelligence community but maybe even within the FBI and the CIA have in fact been politicized. That is a danger to the entire country.

The countries on the list are Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and Morocco. And even the Democrats are praising this move. After being briefed by the department of homeland security, the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff praised the decision in a statement reading in part, quote, ""I full support the new security precautions implemented by the department over the weekend."" The devices are not allowed to be brought into the cabin but can be checked. So does this electronics ban prove that more extreme vetting is needed? Here with reaction the host of ""War Stories,"" Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North. You know what I love. You tell stories, for example.

140,HANNITY," I still don't believe it is. And if you want to believe in waterboarding, all you have to do is watch somebody steal your kid and you capture the person that was assisting, and then they know where your kid's come, I think most people might resort to waterboarding to get the information where the child is. All right, so what do you think of this ban. Why is it important, especially if we're going to allow cell phones, does it matter if you don't allow the larger devices?",6,476.0,90.0,host,107.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-21
141,NORTH," The size of the explosive matters. But it's smart to be paying attention to this clearly new intelligence, as you pointed out, for flights in the U.S. and U.K. And ever since 9/11/01, jihadis have been attempting to bring down an aircraft. Five different events -- underwear, shoes, liquids, a printer, twice with underwear, by the way. There's a fascination there that I don't want to explore too closely. But they've been trying to do it. So the aircraft security measures put in place on Saturday, by the way, it's not going to be immediate, Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and Morocco, are not on the travel ban. That's for Syria, Iran, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, and Sudan.",6,700.0,121.0,guest,108.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-21

143,NORTH," I think in part because the countries that are on the travel ban, it's separate now completely from those who are banned from carrying a cell phone aboard an aircraft. Those countries, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, and Sudan, are literally failed states. They have little or no possibility of doing a vetting process in those countries. So the only real crossover between the measures taken for aircraft and the travel ban is to remind critics of the travel ban that the jihad is not over and it's not likely to be anytime soon.",6,535.0,95.0,guest,110.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-21

147,NORTH," I look at the cost of an airline ticket today and I say how many people would still do it if they had to pay an extra $250, 300 every time they got on an airplane? The reality of it is that the intelligence that we've now got ever since 9/11/01 is clearly focused on the threat. Now it's an electronic device.

Also at this hour, there are not enough votes in the House to pass the Republican plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare but now tonight, White House sources are telling Fox News a deal is very close. Plus, the House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes -- he makes a major announcement that he has now seen reports that U.S. intelligence did, in fact, conduct surveillance of then President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower, and of course, his transition team.

What did Obama know? When did they know it? Newt Gingrich and Circa News's Sara Carter will react in just a few minutes. But now we also turn our attention tonight to a big developing story. As of this moment, the GOP's legislation to repeal and replace ObamaCare scheduled for a vote tomorrow does not have the number of votes needed to pass on that crucial vote. Now, with desperation now sitting in, what can the GOP do to salvage the bill? Well, tonight, White House sources are telling us and the Fox News Channel that the administration is now close to a deal, and Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows confirmed to me and said that they're not there yet, but he's extremely optimistic. He will join us later in the program. Also Freedom Caucus member Congressman Dave Brat. And finally, we turn our attention to our top story tonight, once again terror, this time in London. Earlier today, the suspect, who police say was motivated by terrorism overseas, used a vehicle to mow down pedestrians on the Westminster Bridge in London. After he exited the car, the suspect fatally stabbed a police officer outside of Parliament before being shot dead by police. Now, here's how this horrific terrorist attack unfolded earlier today.

14,HANNITY," Now, in total, the suspect killed four and injured 40. Sadly, today's attack in London is all too familiar for the people of Europe. Now, in November of 2015, radical Islamists launched a series of attacks in Paris targeting a stadium, a cafe and a concert hall. There 130 people were slaughtered, hundreds of others wounded. And one year ago this very day, Islamic extremists set off explosions at the airport and at a metro station in Brussels, killing 34 innocent travelers, including in that case four Americans. In July, the city of Nice, France, was devastated by a truck attack. Now, that attack killed 84 people and injuring more than 200. And a few weeks later in Normandy, two men took hostages in a local church. They slit the throat of a priest all in the name of ISIS. And just days before Christmas in Berlin, Germany, an Islamist plowed a truck into a crowded Christmas market, killing 12, injuring almost 50. Now, this wave of attacks comes as Europe is now facing an ever-increasing problem of Islamization. For example, 2009 study showed that London alone was home to over 80 sharia courts operating independently and without authority from the English government. Now, this has major implications here at home. Now, if we make Europe's mistake, well, what happens? This is coming to a city near you. And that raises the importance of President Trump's agenda in terms of the border wall and implementing extreme vetting. This also comes down to a very simple choice for you, the American people. It's a slight inconvenience for those few travelers who like the privilege to come to our country versus gambling with the lives of American citizens. Joining us now with reaction, the deputy assistant to the president, Dr. Sebastian Gorka. Dr. Gorka, let's -- here we go again. It's Islamization. You and I have discussed it about Europe. You believe ISIS can be defeated. Your reaction to this attack, and you know, add the importance now of extreme vetting and border security.",1,1996.0,343.0,host,11.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22

You just went through the list. How many more of these do we need to see? How many people need to die before it is understood that what we are trying to do in the Trump administration is to stop events like this happening on U.S. soil? This isn't -- this should be a surprise to nobody. ISIS in their publications, publications, Al Qaeda in English language jihadi texts have said this is what you do. You don't need some grand army. You don't need weapons of mass destruction. You steal a truck. You steal an SUV. And look at what happened afterwards. You get a -- do you remember the decapitation of the British serviceman in Woolich (ph)? This is the same scenario. Back then, two jihadis got in a vehicle, ran down the Lee Rigby and then decapitated him on the streets of London. The knife intifada in Israel is from the same textbook.

I don't say this lightly.

Marital rape in some countries is not a crime. Gays and lesbians are killed as a matter of course. Christians and Jews are persecuted.

It is not a right of anybody to come and live in the United States. If you want to come here, the measure will be whether or not you respect the constitutional order of this nation and the founding documents. If you don't, Sean, I don't care if you are a member of the KKK or a member of the Communist Party, you are a threat to the United States.

Joining us now, the author of the New York Times best-seller, ""Treason,"" former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich. You know, Dr. Gorka mentioned evil, Mr. Speaker. And I wrote a book once, ""Deliver Us From Evil,"" and I looked at the last 100 years of human history. You are a great historian -- over 100 million human souls destroyed by evil. When you look at Nazism, fascism, totalitarianism, communism, the killing fields, Pol Pot -- this is a clear and present danger today. It is modern day evil, radical Islam, what do we do? What should we be learning from what's happened in Europe with migration and refugees?",1,817.0,145.0,host,19.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
23,"NEWT GINGRICH, R-FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," Well, let me say first of all, Dr. Gorka was, I thought, tremendous in his contribution just now and really nailed it. I think you have to recognize that the reminder from London is that in addition to the decisive destruction of ISIS in Syria, we are faced with a worldwide threat and we need a worldwide strategy. I'm delighted that Secretary Tillerson has been meeting with our allies on the ISIS issue. But there is this bigger question -- the last administration, of course, Obama wouldn't even admit it was a problem. I do think with President Trump and with his security team, you have people who are beginning to work on this. But this is a reminder that we face a movement which in some ways uses the internet, uses other kind of devices and is a threat all over the planet. And I think we’re going to have to design a strategy. And Dr. Gorka began to hint at part of that, at the very end. We're going to have to be much clearer about how we're going to measure people and what we're going to require in terms of recognizing and being loyal to our constitutional documents.",1,1084.0,202.0,guest,20.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
24,HANNITY," We've had our own issues with refugees and migrants in this country, but nothing compared to what Europe has been experiencing, and dramatic increases in terror attacks and major crimes. We've seen it not only in France and Great Britain and Belgium and Germany, but all throughout the European Union. And I think this is really a moment that America really needs to pause and ask itself, are we going to follow the same path they have followed? And are we prepared for the consequences that they have had in Europe? We have enough terror going on in Boston at the marathon and Chattanooga, at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, at Fort Hood and San Bernardino. We have our own problems already. Do we really want to invite other problems without a proper vetting system?",1,769.0,136.0,host,21.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
25,GINGRICH," I think that's part of it. And the other part of it is when people come here, we need to go back to teaching people how to be American, to assimilating them into an American civilization. We absorb lots of people from lots of places. We can do it again. But part of that requires that we defeat this left-wing mythology that you can be multicultural and still be a single country. I think we can have many peoples come to America, but they need to learn to be American if they're going to live here.",1,500.0,97.0,guest,22.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22

In Great Britain, of all countries, they have 83 specific sharia courts, separate and apart from the judicial system of Great Britain.

I think we have to say we're happy for everyone to be Americans. We’re happy for people who come here to learn to be American. But we are not going to allow sharia courts. We're not going to allow no-go zones, and we're not going to allow people to decide that they are in America but not part of America.

32,HANNITY," And that raises -- and that raises the question that I was asking Dr. Gorka, and it goes to the heart of extreme vetting. And I would add a lot of other countries to it and make anybody that wants to be a guest in our country pay for their own vetting -- my own thoughts. But how do you ascertain, knowing that ISIS -- they may be evil, but they're not stupid, and they probably would be well trained and coached on giving answers if they were being vetted. So I guess the question is, how do you possibly vet the mind, the heart and the soul of somebody coming from a country whose culture, for example, is like Saudi Arabia?",1,627.0,123.0,host,29.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
33,GINGRICH," Well, I think part of it is you've got to have a lot more information than we have from anywhere in Syria about their background. What kind of a mosque do they go to? What kind of people do they hang out with? And I think you've got to be able to go back three, four or five years. Not just -- just getting into the room to answer questions doesn't get you anywhere. But tracking down how they behaved, who they associated with does give you a dramatically better sense of who they are.

The media has been so wrong for so long -- you know, they're trying to make a big deal -- Well, was he actually wiretapped or were there surveillance? For two weeks on this program, we have been pointing out that, in fact, surveillance did take place. Now this is confirmed. And Devin Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee chair, is very disturbed. I think every American should feel the same way. Your thoughts.",2,555.0,101.0,host,40.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
51,GINGRICH," Well, I think -- I hope that both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are going to dig into this and rip apart the bureaucracies and find out who did it, who authorized it, how did they make the changes that the Obama committee -- the Obama presidency made to make it easier to leak? This is really very, very sobering about American civil liberties. Here apparently you have a president whose party is defeated who then uses the intelligence apparatus of the United States and then changes the rules, knowing it will make it easier to leak. And this whole thing is sick. I also think that it is astonishing to have had everybody pile on President Trump, and now it turned out that President Trump was right. I look forward to The New York Times and The Washington Post issuing editorials of mea culpa, admitting that Trump was right and they were wrong.

56,HANNITY," They've all been wrong. But there's a real danger here to me, and that is -- look, I understand. I'm a big supporter of the intelligence community, as I know you are, Mr. Speaker. A lot of these people put their lives on the line. This is an evil, dangerous world. We need that intelligence. And -- but there are very specific laws and rules regarding the wiretapping surveillance of Americans. We still have a 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th amendment here, OK? And if they -- there are rules, for example, if they, in fact -- if they're surveilling, say, a Russian ambassador, an Iranian ambassador, that's their job. But if they notice an American is on the line, they're supposed to practice what's called for minimization. I've also talked to those people that have worked in intelligence. Normal practice is they don't identify who the American is. They will say an American. But in the case of General Flynn, they mentioned him. Now we know that they had a surveillance of the president-elect and on members of the transition team. Well, did they have a warrant for those? Apparently not. It might be more felonies. That's the one thing that we seem to have clear here. Your thoughts on that.",2,1187.0,212.0,host,45.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
57,GINGRICH," Well, I think we've got to go back to the rule of law. That's why I think the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have to have deep investigations, tear this thing apart, and figure out who did what, when did they do it, who authorized it, who broke the law, and then insist that the Justice Department prosecute the people who broke the law. I mean, this is one of the most incredible breaches that I can think of since World War II where an American elected -- the new elected president is being, in effect, spied upon by his own government? That's really sobering.",2,573.0,106.0,guest,46.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
58,HANNITY," Yes. Well, there's one other point that and that is James Clapper, national director of intelligence, the FBI director, Admiral Rogers have all not said not one vote -- not one was influenced as was asked by Chairman Nunes in the hearings. All right, I've got to move on to one other question. And we have Mark Meadows and Congressman Dave Brat coming up. I spoke to Freedom Caucus members earlier today. They would know, at least 30, probably more, that they had that were not going to vote for this bill. In the course of today, there have been meetings with the White House, and more specifically, the president and Mark Meadows himself. There's been a breakthrough tonight. Now, the only thing that I hear is remaining as the actual language, but an agreement in principle has been made. How important is this that the president is the one that made that breakthrough?",2,873.0,155.0,host,47.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
59,GINGRICH," This is vitally important. It's Donald Trump at his best. He did write ""The Art of the Deal."" I think it was extremely important that they avoided defeat on this first big test of his presidency. I am delighted that he's intervened personally to break up what was apparently a logjam between the speaker and the Freedom Caucus, and I think it is very much to President Trump's credits. And let me say also to Reince Priebus's credit, who has been very hard- working, trying to get this thing to come together just right. So I think that the president, Vice President Pence and Reince Priebus have all helped to unlock this thing. I hope that sometime this evening, that Speaker Ryan is going to accept language and they're going to have a deal done. If they do and if it passes tomorrow, this is a historic moment, and it is President Trump's moment. He will have earned it.",2,875.0,160.0,guest,48.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
60,HANNITY," You know, it was interesting as I was talking to Freedom Caucus members today, their number one concern was defending the president on this because they felt if this doesn't work, it hurts him. And that was their main argument, very interesting behind the scenes. But Mr. Speaker, I hope they learn from this, too, and maybe they can build more consensus before they roll out bills. Hopefully, we learn a lesson. But I agree with you, a lot of people worked very hard and came together in the end. We appreciate you being with us.

And of course they say they now know who the attacker was, they're not releasing the name. But we do know more about the victims today, the five people so far who have been killed, among them P.C. Palmer. He was 48-years-old, he had a young family. He was killed while protecting members of parliament at the Palace of Westminster. Also among them was a 30-year the woman. She was killed on a bridge, the assailant himself and two other people. We know at 2:45 or so the car was crossing Westminster Bridge. It sped onto the pavement of the sidewalk at about 35 miles an hour. And as it careened down it killed innocent people left and right. And today we know also that parliament was sitting at the time. The prime minister herself was in parliament. She was rushed out soon after. As you heard there, she has said that this will not bring down the country. They will stand as strong as ever. And of course those few connections still to ISIS. Remember this is a year to the day that the Brussels attacks were carried out, 32 people killed in those attacks directly inspired by ISIS. It's also the same day at 68 foreign ministers were meeting in D.C. to discuss the coalition against ISIS. And of course the terror group are on the back foot at the moment and have been reaching out, calling out to their followers to reach out and attack the west if they can, in particular using vehicles. And we've seen their propaganda pointing toward this. It's a method they've used time and time again. We've seen it in Berlin. We've seen it in Nice. We've seen it twice here today. Despite security around this heavily guarded the building, it worked again and they were able to take the lives of five people.

You and I have had long discussions both on-air and off-air about the Islamization of Europe, about refugees, about migrants and how it impacted the Brexit vote, how it impacted the election of Donald Trump.

And the problem with multiculturalism is that it leads to divided communities. It's quite different from multi-racialism. That's fine. That can work very happily and extremely well. But we finished up with very divided communities. I'm sorry to say, but we now have a fifth column living inside these European countries. And surely, surely an American audience seeing this horrendous thing happening at Westminster today should start to say to itself that when Donald Trump tries to put in place vetting measures, he's doing it to protect your country.

So I'm seeing real progress and I'm excited about where were going tonight with this. And I want to give just a real shout out to the president.,4,322.0,65.0,guest,71.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
89,HANNITY," And you're crediting the president himself for this breakthrough, if you will, because if you guys held firm like I was told by you this morning and by others this morning and your caucus, this was not going to pass tomorrow. Unless this was fixes this won't pass, you're saying.",4,280.0,51.0,host,72.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
90,MEADOWS, That's correct. We needed substantial changes and we still have a large group that's committed to no until they really can review the details and see where were going with all of this. So we're not there yet but I can tell you were working on it.,4,247.0,48.0,guest,73.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22

92,"REP. DAVE BRAT, R-VA."," Same place. And hats off to our chairman, Mark Meadows for just a phenomenal job negotiating. He's been on the phone with President Trump daily multiple times a day. And they're both doing a tremendous job. And just for the folks out there, right, we started from a position that we are going to keep our promise and repeal this bill. The language that we are going to repeal and then replace. And so I just want to ensure the folks out there, when they hear about a deal, that deal has to at the very minimum now lower the cost curve for health insurance for the people out there. And so there's a heavy lift out there. We're negotiating that heavy lift. And it will be the real deal. And we're doing this because we want President Trump to be successful. If we don't get the cost curve down, then you're going to end up in death spirals again in a few years, and this time we'll own it. So it's a win-win. We're not trying to hold things up.",4,944.0,182.0,guest,75.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
93,HANNITY," Both of you told me and you were very firm about this. Congressman Meadows specifically and Dave Brat specifically, both of you told me that the reason you're fighting for this is for the president's sake, because he can't have his name on a bill, you said, that's going to end up in a bad way. So your motivation was to get it right.",4,335.0,65.0,host,76.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
94,MEADOWS," It is. It's really about the American people, Sean, and when we really look at this, its commitment from the president to lower insurance premiums, to repeal this, to make sure that those preexisting conditions are taken care of. And so it's all about making sure that we get it right for the American people. And I can tell you he's got a board on all the campaign promises that he's made. And he's checking those off, and he's serious about that.",4,449.0,83.0,guest,77.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
95,HANNITY," I know he is. Yes, so it's an issue of language, an agreement of principle. And we'll watch by tomorrow morning, I guess by this time tomorrow night we'll know where this vote ends up. And I wish you, seriously, this is an important piece. This is no room for failure in my mind here. This is way too important. And if you guys can come together, that's great for the country. Thank you both for being with us, appreciate it.",4,426.0,82.0,host,78.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22

99,HANNITY," This is a Fox News alert. Earlier today House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes made the bombshell announcement confirming what President Trump has been now saying for weeks, that in fact surveillance was collected on members of his team, including himself. Joining us with reaction from Circa News is Sara Carter. With all the breaking news tonight, Sara, this would have been my lead on any other night. This is what you have been telling this audience for over two weeks straight now, and corroborates and confirms everything you and John Solomon reported. I want your full reaction to it anything you want to add to this.",5,626.0,107.0,host,81.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
100,"SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS"," I think it is hugely significant. My reaction to this is, look, these sources approached Chairman Nunes. They had information, classified information that revealed what we had been reporting all along. And obviously that's information that I as a reporter can't accept or take from sources. We have been told this. That's why we were out here telling the audience every day for the last two weeks. This goes far beyond what the scope of what everybody is reporting out there. One of the things, unmasking of the names, going beyond Russia. So what Chairman Nunes was able to show was that it wasn't just about Russia. They were getting transcripts with unmasked names from people within the Trump team that were not about Russia at all. So we need to ask two questions, very important questions, Sean. Who were on those logs that viewed these reports, and who approved it? Those are the two most important questions.",5,917.0,159.0,guest,82.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
101,HANNITY," I say to little differently maybe to be more a little more incendiary because that's my nature. Who knew what when, and what did they know, and when did they know it? These questions now must be answered. This is so unprecedented. You talk about unmasked. That revelation in the course of regular surveillance is supposed to be as regular order. It is supposed to be hidden, and then it delves into executive order 12333, why did Obama change it to allow 16 other agencies to have access to it. Was that designed to purposefully leak this information? There's so many unanswered questions. Where do you think this goes? That's my most important question.",5,655.0,115.0,host,83.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
102,CARTER," OK, I think this goes -- the next step, we need to know to some extent what were the other documents that were viewed by the personnel inside the intelligence community. And remember, Sean, this is a very narrow scope of people that can approve the unmasking of names, and that needs to be revealed as well. I think Chairman Nunes is on to something here. I know we're on to something here. This is something that we are looking into. We've been investigating diligently and hopefully we can break it on your show.",5,515.0,95.0,guest,84.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
103,HANNITY," You'll be on the program tomorrow. He said he was bothered by one other thing, now we have James Clapper, Admiral Rogers, and a James Comey saying no votes were influenced at all. So this whole Russian narrative by a biased media has been wrong for all of these months. This is deep and profound and very problematic. We have 30 seconds.",5,338.0,63.0,host,85.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
104,CARTER," Yes, I think this goes far beyond what the American people actually realize. This is about right to privacy. This goes far beyond the scope of the FISA. And this wasn't what the government said it was intended for. And it's very, very dangerous. It's dangerous to the republic. It's dangerous to us as private citizens.

Tomorrow night right here on this programming, House Intel Committee Chairman Congressman Devin Nunes will join us. Also Sara Carter will be with us again tomorrow night 10:00 eastern. Also tomorrow, we'll be keeping an eye on this health care vote. It still needs the language to meet. If that happens, it will pass. If not, I predict it doesn't. That's all the time we have left this evening.",6,468.0,81.0,host,90.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-22
0,"SEAN HANNITY, HOST"," And welcome to ""Hannity."" And this is a Fox News Alert. House Intelligence Committee chairman Congressman Devin Nunes Monica Crowley, Lou Dobbs will all be here in just a few minutes. Now, tonight also, James Rosen is reporting that sources are now telling Fox News there is potentially, quote, ""a smoking gun"" that proves the Obama administration spied on the Trump team. But first, the vote to repeal and replace ObamaCare in the House of Representatives has now been postponed until tomorrow. Now, we know there's a lot of anger, a lot of frustration in Washington, around the country. But unless we learn from the past, we're doomed to repeat it. Now, right here on this program, I have promised you that I will hold Washington accountable, and tonight, we are doing just that. So where did this process go so horribly wrong? That's tonight's ""Opening Monologue."" All right, believe it or not, we got to start with a basic, fundamental civics lesson. As most of you know, our federal government consists of three branches, the executive branch, the legislative branch and the judicial branch. Now, all three under the Constitution have enumerated powers and share a duty to use these powers in the best interests of you, the American people. Now, President Trump -- we can see the checklist -- he's been working hard to keep his promises, the promises he made to you, the American people, checking them off one by one. But we have a problem. In the legislative branch it's a very, very different story. Now, the reason that we are here tonight in this position without a vote to repeal and replace ObamaCare is because this legislative process has been beyond contentious, unorganized and disjointed. You've seen the infighting. You've seen the miscommunication. You've seen the squabbles on TV, right here on Fox, on radio, all because the legislative branch did not do their job properly. Now, for seven long years, the GOP ran on repealing and replacing ObamaCare. They said, ""Give us the House."" They got that in 2010. They said, ""Give us the House and the Senate."" They got that in 2014. Then they said, ""Give us the House, the Senate and the presidency,"" and on November 8th, they got that wish, and frankly, in spite of many Republicans not even supporting the nominee of their party, which to me was nothing short of disgraceful. Now, in a perfect world, the work on repealing and replacement of ObamaCare, well, that would have begun on November 9th, but that didn't happen. And in a perfect world, the GOP would've built consensus among the different factions within the GOP -- meaning the moderates, the conservatives, the Freedom Caucus, the Study Group -- before ever unveiling the bill. That, too, never happened. Instead, in the two weeks leading up to the release of this bill, House members were saying they were dissatisfied with the legislative process. They were being left in the dark, they had concerns that this bill would not work for their constituents. By the way, they never got to see it. So once the American Health Care Act was really revealed, infighting ensued and a public civil war. Well, we've been watching that unfold. Now, this bill was quickly labeled ""RyanCare,"" ""ObamaCare lite."" President Trump, he didn't write this legislation, which, by the way, is not his job. He was then tasked with bringing all of these different groups, all these special interests together. Also, respected groups and think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, the Club for Growth, FreedomWorks, Cato, Americans for Prosperity, and frankly, every major conservative radio talk show host in the country and the American people, were all confused, angered and frustrated. And that's why we are here tonight. The legislative branch was clearly, in spite of all of this talk for seven years, ill-prepared for this moment to lead. They have now failed the president, and it's starting to look like they're the gang that can't shoot straight. Here's the bottom line. President Trump was not served well by his party in the House of Representatives, and he has been put in the position now to do their job and do all the heavy lifting on this bill. And it's no wonder that according to RealClearPolitics and their average, congressional approval is at an embarrassingly low 20.8 percent. So tonight, here we are. We find ourselves at a crossroad, at a stalemate. So instead of ranting and raving, I'm thinking, all right, how do we solve this problem and fix this mess by tomorrow? Because my sources are telling me that the president, if he doesn't get this bill tomorrow, it's over for this session of Congress. My advice tonight for the legislative branch is to do what you should have done from the beginning. That is, bring a coalition of your party, all the different factions, bring them into a room. Take away everybody's phones, lock the doors, order pizza, get some beer, whatever you need to survive for however long it takes. The meeting should include moderates, the GOP Study Group, the Freedom Caucus, members of the U.S. Senate, because we have to deal with the reconciliation and procedural issues. The White House should be represented, including the vice president, the Health and Human Services secretary. In other words, it's time to start working with a sense of urgency that most in America work with every day. It's time to fix this mess that you have made for the president, and it's time for you to give the American people a bill that you have now promised them for almost eight years. Now, I would argue tonight, failure is not an option for the president of the United States and his first major piece of legislation. Now, if you don't succeed, you will have nobody to blame but yourselves. But at this hour, there's still time. If there's hope for success. Now, Secretary Price, Vice President Mike Pence have both assured me that the president's letter to the Freedom Caucus is 100 percent locked in cement and that those changes will be made in phases two and three, which by the way, we didn't find out about that until after the bill was released. And if not -- by the way, I have it on very good authority this health care bill will die in Congress tomorrow and will not be brought up this session. I was told by very high sources in government. Now, I'm arguing tonight that should not and cannot happen. And here's my message to you people in Congress. For the love of God, after eight years, can you please do your job? Can you please find a way to work together? Can you please find a way to serve your country, not yourselves, not your reelection? It is time to serve your president and the people you represent. It's time for you to fix this and show the American people that they did the right thing by giving you the power and the authority to lead, because you don't look like you're leading right now.

But it's also an opportunity for the president to stand up and lead from here because Ryan has shown he is not the leader. He is as ineffective as you have described him, as disappointing. He has failed in his imagination. He's failed as the steward and the shepherd in the House of Representatives for many of the reasons that you cite, plus a host of others. This is a man who is speaker, who has done nothing in two years, almost two years. He hasn't even been speaker for two years. This is a man who's only passed three pieces of legislation in his entire career. We're talking about 18 years in Congress!

74,"MONICA CROWLEY, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR"," Well, look, I think voters are incredibly disappointed by what we're seeing. I think they're outraged by what we're seeing. As you pointed out, they've had eight years to get their act together on this. Voters expect the Republican Party to just do a few things well, Sean, tax reform and the economy, national security and repealing and replacing ""Obama care."" Why? Because when you're talking about ""Obama care,"" it's not just the specifics of health care reform, which we do not. It gets to the core issues of individual freedom and the role and scope of government. That's what made it so important to Barack Obama and the left to make sure that that was the first things that they did when Obama came into office and they had those huge majorities. Voters sent Republicans in wave elections in 2010, 2014, where they flipped the House and the Senate, gave them total control. And you know what? It was primarily driven by a reaction against ""Obama care,"" and the Republicans...",2,983.0,172.0,guest,65.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23

77,HANNITY," Let me move the ball. I agree with all of that, and this was so poorly managed from the get-go, Mercedes, because no consensus was built. Nobody saw the bill beforehand. And frankly, the person that ended up having to do the heavy lift was the president, and that really is job of the speaker and the legislative branch and the leadership. With that said, can this be saved? For example, the president making a side agreement in letter that phase two will give them -- give the Freedom Caucus the things that they want, that they said they need to get to this bill passed.

So I think it shows two things, one that the conservative caucus is incredibly powerful in moving this legislation and shaping this legislation, with the case of being led by the Freedom Caucus and the Republican Study Committee. But also, Sean, I think that it's imperative for Republicans to decide -- to find compromise, to find consensus and to pass this legislation because this is going to be critical for the president to have this victory, this legislative victory, and that will determine how his future legislative agenda will shape up...",2,790.0,134.0,guest,69.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23

Let's go over what it is that you said the other day, which has now gotten a lot of play, and that is, in fact, surveillance took place in November, December and January of the president-elect, his transition team. What else do you know?",3,394.0,69.0,host,102.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
118,"REP. DEVIN NUNES, R-CALIF."," Well, what bothers me is what I was able to review. It looks like it was in November, December and January. Those reports are concerning to me, and I briefed the speaker and then went to -- I spoke to the news media publicly, and then went to brief the president on what I saw because I think it's important that he sees it.",3,325.0,65.0,guest,103.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
119,HANNITY," The president then said that he felt vindicated over his claims that he felt he was -- well, he said wiretapping, but surveillance, wiretapping -- in my view, we're just really parsing words. But he was picked up at least in an incidental way. Can you give us more detail about it?",3,282.0,53.0,host,104.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
120,NUNES," Well, it's tough for me to get into it, right, because I've only read the report, so I don't know all the intelligence that went into it. But to me, I mean, it's clear that I would be concerned if I was the president. And that's why I wanted him to know, and I felt like I had a duty and obligation to tell him because, as you know, he's been taking a lot of heat in the news media. And I think to some degree, there are some things that he should look at to see whether, in fact, he thinks the collection was proper or not.",3,525.0,109.0,guest,105.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
121,HANNITY," All right, what about this process -- because we've got to go back. I think you would agree with me that the unmasking -- if we have our intelligence community doing their job -- and I want to emphasize that I have great faith in our intelligence community, and they provide this country with safety and security. It is a necessary evil in an evil world, right? But in the process of surveilling anybody from any foreign country, which they have a right to do and an obligation to do, if an American is picked up on that call, isn't it standard operating procedure, is that they don't unmask the identity of the American, doesn't matter who it is, and that when they write up the report, they usually would not include the name of that person or details, they would minimize what the American was saying, isn't that standard operating procedure?",3,846.0,153.0,host,106.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
122,NUNES," I think there's a couple different issues at play here. So names for sure if they're picked up in any incidental collection of any kind, they should be minimized. However, the other issue you're bringing up is unmasking. So if there was an unmasking of a name, additional names, we need to know who requested that unmasking, what was the purpose for unmasking, because it should be pretty rare that American names are unmasked. And that's what we're trying to get to the bottom of and hope that we get some of the information tomorrow so that the rest of our committee can review it.",3,584.0,106.0,guest,107.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
123,HANNITY," And then that would also mean that in the case of General Flynn, not only did an unmasking take place but also on intelligence leak, which as I understand it never happens in a case where signal intelligence such as this is in fact obtained, is that correct?",3,259.0,49.0,host,108.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
124,NUNES," Yes. I've never heard of that happening before, and as I've said many times, the only crime that we know that has been committed is that one, and it's quite clear that it was a crime. I think you said it right, Sean. These programs are vitally important to the security of our country and that's why we take this seriously here in Congress to conduct our oversight. And clearly when I see a problem, I'm going to pointed out.",3,426.0,81.0,guest,109.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
125,HANNITY," In the case of any type of leak that would be a violation of the espionage act, that would be a felony, that would be five years potentially in prison?",3,152.0,31.0,host,110.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
126,NUNES," That's correct. And it appears like that happened, right. We won't know till we get all the details, but from my perspective, it appears like that was a crime.",3,160.0,30.0,guest,111.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
127,HANNITY," And that raises another question, because you talked about it being widely dispensed within the intelligence community, meaning many people saw the surveillance of the president-elect and his transition team and they were identified. Then it goes to the issue to how many people have access to it. Two weeks before President Obama left office he modified executive order 12333 which allowed in the sharing of this type of intelligence, which has never happened before, with 16 other agencies. Is there a possibility that was done so that leaks could be covered up, sir?",3,570.0,95.0,host,112.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
128,NUNES," In the reports that I read, they were clearly disseminated far and wide. And I don't think it actually has anything to do with the change in that procedure. But what I saw was disseminated pretty far, and in many cases you have to wonder why, which is why I raised the question.",3,279.0,54.0,guest,113.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
129,HANNITY," But prior to that the modification of executive order 12333, it was not usual practice to widely disseminate. So certainly, look, if this happened in November and December, that didn't happen until January, the alteration of 12333, is there anybody you saw that had dissemination of these documents?",3,300.0,49.0,host,114.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
130,NUNES," I don't want to get in the weeds here, Sean. I don't believe that change impacted what I saw.",3,94.0,20.0,guest,115.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
131,HANNITY, OK.,3,,,,116.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
132,NUNES," With that said, I will say that the dissemination was pretty far and wide. And like I've said before, I think it appears to me that it was all legal. The question is should it have been done in the first place, did it meet foreign intelligence value? And then secondly were any other American names unmasked? And I have information that says that there were.",3,359.0,67.0,guest,117.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
133,HANNITY," Do you question whether or not it was necessary for surveillance? In other words, when you read it, OK, so-and-so was talking to so-and-so. Did you get the impression why would this be surveilled in the first place? I think there is in a lot of what I saw, there is a lot of foreign intelligence value. Our analysts do a really good job, our intelligence agents do a great job. And so what it was, it was on the margins. I'm just not sure it should have been included into an intelligence report. And then surely there shouldn't have been an unmasking of an additional Americans' name.",3,586.0,109.0,host,118.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
134,HANNITY," Congressman, did you see any legal issues that would worry the president in any way, shape, matter, or form?",3,109.0,20.0,host,119.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
135,NUNES," No. And I've said that too. What I saw had nothing to do with Russia. This has nothing to do with the Russian investigation. But it was important enough that I thought the president of the United States should know what is being said about him and his transition team. The FBI director did confirm, it is usual practice and I heard James Comey say it himself that they don't comment on potential or ongoing investigations. He did confirm an investigation into Russian influencing of the election, but he wouldn't confirm whether or not there will be an investigation. And you pressed him hard on the issue of whether or not to those people leaking intelligence, whether that's being investigated. It seems to me that the FBI director should be able to have it both ways.",3,771.0,137.0,guest,120.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
136,NUNES," The leak investigation or lack of the leak investigation is quite concerning. We need to make sure that these leaks are being tracked down, and it's part of our investigation is to make sure that we do try to find who was at least knowledgeable of the information that eventually got leaked.",3,292.0,53.0,guest,121.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
137,HANNITY," One last question. In terms of the ability, we look at the leak of General Flynn, we know that's a felony. Do agree that's a felony?",3,133.0,27.0,host,122.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
138,NUNES, Yes.,3,5.0,2.0,guest,123.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
139,HANNITY," Is it something that would have to come -- could this happen at a low level or is this something that could happen at a very high level, meaning a director or just below a director?

147,HANNITY," Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So tonight our own James Rosen is reporting that according to sources, Republican congressional investigators, they expect this week to receive a potential, quote, ""smoking gun,"" one that will prove the Obama administration spied on the Trump transition team in the weeks following the November election. Rosen in an article posted up right now on FOXNews.com writes, quote, ""The intelligence is said to leave no doubt that the Obama administration in its closing days was using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on president-elect Trump according to sources."" Here now with reaction, from Circa News, Sara Carter, from the American Center for Law and Justice, Jay Sekulow. I see you smiling, Sara, because every day, everything you said is coming true. I expect this is going to come out tomorrow. Based on my interview, what did you think, A, of what Devin Nunes said, and what do you think about this Rosen report?",4,974.0,162.0,host,131.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
148,"SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS"," On the Rosen report first, I think that it's going to be an accumulation of evidence, not just one little piece of evidence but an accumulation of evidence that's going to expose what's been going on. We are going to have more facts tomorrow when the information is delivered to the chairman. And if we're looking at the scope of this, I think the most important thing that Chairman Nunes said, and you brought up, Sean, yourself was this expansion of the 12333. If we look at the evidence, a lot of this information that the chairman selected happened before that. So the question we have to be asking ourselves is what changed? If it was legal to collect this evidence, not the unmasking of all of these names, but if this was collected legally, was there something else that happened before this that we're not aware of yet? And I saw Chairman Nunes kind of dancing around that a little bit.",4,895.0,163.0,guest,132.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23

152,"JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE"," I'll tell you the biggest take away from your interview, and it was a great interview with Congressman Nunes, was the fact that he said some this was not 12333 information. In other words, it was the change to allow the broad dissemination of this material which previous you weren't able to do. He is saying it doesn't implicate that, which means this information could well have been disclosed without any cover of legitimacy under at an executive order, not that that executive order was legitimate in my view, but that executive order may be gone. You know what I think we've got here, Sean? I think we've got a constitutional crisis of James Comey's making. So this is a constitutional crisis from Comey. And Comey was an administration official also under President Obama. This idea that President Obama did not order it does not answer the question of was the Obama administration responsible for this, because the fact is, and this is clear, they were the administration in power. So this surveillance that we now know was going on, they're responsible, period.",4,1070.0,184.0,guest,136.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
153,HANNITY," It gets to what he knew or what others knew, who knew what when and where, and what did they know and when did they knew it? So Jay told me where he think it's going, Sara. Where do you think it's going?",4,204.0,44.0,host,137.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
154,CARTER," I think the expansion goes way beyond Comey. I think this goes straight to the highest levels of the Obama administration. And that's where these answers need to come from. We need to find out who unmasked these names. And it wasn't just Director Comey. There were other people that had access to this. The NSA can unmask these names, so who requested that? That's one of the most important, important questions here, Sean, and why. And I think once those questions start to get answered, just like Chairman Nunez said, then we'll know, was their political espionage? And if there was, Sean, this is the greatest civil liberties violation that we have seen in our country in a long time.",4,688.0,122.0,guest,138.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
155,HANNITY, This would make Watergate look like kindergarten?,4,50.0,8.0,host,139.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
156,SEKULOW," Oh, yes. Sean, here's what I would tell you. You want to get to the answer of this question? Subpoena a couple of people including the former president of the United States. You want to find out what he knew and when knew it? Ask him, especially if this was not anything outside of the scope of legitimacy. If this was, quote, ""a legal surveillance"" but they unmasked this information, which is not --ask the president directly.",4,429.0,78.0,guest,140.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
157,HANNITY," The bottom line is they were surveilling the president. And Sara, you believe it was before the election and now we are getting it confirmed by James Rosen after the election. You also said it had happened after the election, but we're getting more specific. Now, there should be ways to determine who had access to what this intelligence was. The fact that Devin Nunes said it was widely disseminated before 12333 was amended, that tells me that maybe that in and of itself was wrong. It would have to be the highest level of intelligence agencies that had it, because nobody else would otherwise have access, right, Sara?",4,624.0,110.0,host,141.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23
158,CARTER," That's absolutely correct. And remember, every time you go into a SCIF, every time you go into these secured compartmentalized facilities to view this information, you have to swipe in. You have to swipe in, you have to sign a log. It doesn't matter if you're an analyst working on a case or if you're John Brennan, the former director of the CIA. You have to swipe in. So there are logs out there, Sean, and there is evidence out there. Some of that's classified, but they are able to get a hold of it. If Chairman Nunes can get a hold of that information he can start finding out who --",4,589.0,113.0,guest,142.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23

161,SEKULOW," I think the attorney general needs to empanel a grand jury, that's the first thing that needs to happen, and start this investigation, because what Sara said is correct. You can find out who did this. So that's number one. Number two, for the chairman of the intelligence committee, he needs to get the background data, because what he saw in those reports shocked him, obviously, not just because it named President Trump potentially and his associates but also the nature of the dissemination itself. And that dissemination, that unmasking can well be a crime. So they need to get the background data. And Sean, President Trump can get this information. He's got the highest security clearance, he is the president of the United States and the commander-in-chief, he can get that information and they need to get it and Jeff Sessions' needs to be working on it.",4,864.0,149.0,guest,144.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-23

And they unveil a bill that nobody saw, that many people had many of the criticisms you have, and then they hand it off to the president to do all the heavy lifting, shouldn't that consensus have been built after eight long years? Shouldn't have been prepared and written and agreed upon and ready to go? It seems to me that it should have been such a consensus bill by that point that the president could have gone out and said here's our replacement bill and, by the way, he could have done it in front of every Republican House member and every Republican senator, but they weren't prepared.

That's a pretty severe charge and one that deserves a full-throated response, and that's tonight's ""Opening Monologue."" All right, this all started three weeks ago, when I agreed to do an interview with ""CBS Sunday Morning"" and their special contributor, Ted Koppel. Now, the interview lasted well over 45 minutes, and we discussed in great detail why there's such a great divide in America in politics and in media. Now, in my honest opinion, the exchange was actually a very good substantive give and take and worthwhile for any audience to see.

22,HANNITY," Wow! He's kind of calling me a liar. And then he's saying, ""Well, you and all these opinion shows"" -- he's giving his opinion! Only 70 seconds, that's it, ended up airing. Now, I guess people like Ted Koppel feel you, the American people, can't distinguish between opinion and news. That's kind of like Obama, remember? He said people clinging to their God, guns and religion, or Hillary Clinton who said ignorant, irredeemable deplorables. Now, beyond this interview being a total waste of my time, it is a flagrant example of what I call edited fake news. Now, remember, CBS News is the former home of Dan Rather. Remember? He was forced to resign after reporting an inflammatory fake news story about President George W. Bush. Rather used fake documents to bolster his story. Now, CBS News is also the former home of Sharyl Attkisson. Remember? She there was marginalized at CBS and stonewalled, and they wouldn't show a lot of her investigative journalism into President Obama and his administration. Is that agenda-driven? And now they produce a package taking shots at me all while prominently displaying their dishonesty, their bias and total hypocrisy here for every viewer to see! Now, Ted's interview with me wasn't about substance. It wasn't about getting my real opinion. Now, the story was written long before he walked into this studio here at Fox. I was just used as a prop to advance his narrative, which is why only one minute and 10 seconds out of the 45 to 50 minutes was actually used! In other words, it was one minute, and that's the one minute that fit into their narrative. That is edited fake news. By the way, other networks -- they play the same game and they have for many years. And now it's time to expose this for what it really is. And I have the ability to fight back. Cheap shot attacks in the name of, quote, ""journalism,"" all to advance their biased agenda. Now, what Ted was really asking is this: Are our opinion shows bad for America? He thinks they are. Meanwhile, Ted was giving his opinion. He considers himself an impartial journalist, yet in what CBS News was airing, he's doing exactly what he said is bad for America! Now, right here on this show, on ""Hannity,"" I expressed my opinion because I am a talk show host, an advocacy journalist, if you will. Ted Koppel? He thinks he's down the middle, fair and balanced, a real journalist. Ted, you show in this clip you are not a journalist! You're very hypocritical here. Now, have you ever said -- for example, you work for CBS, Dan Rather worked for CBS. Ted, did you ever say that George W. Bush, the attack by Dan Rather was bad for America? Did you ever say CBS, when they spiked Sharyl Attkisson's story, that that's bad for America? Did you ever wonder if the stories were spiked because the head of CBS News and that division, David Rhodes, happens to be the brother of Ben Rhodes, the high-ranking official for then President Obama? Is that a conflict of interest? Now, I'm willing to look at my body of work and compare it with CBS News any day of the week. Did CBS News even one time ever ask President Obama about his relationship with an unrepentant terrorist, where he started his political career? Well, I did CBS's job. I did it for you, Ted. Did you ever delve deep into what black liberation theology is and how it motivated President Obama, then candidate Obama, for over 20 years, the church Reverend Wright, the church of ""G-d America,"" the church of ""American chickens have come home to roost?"" Now, after eight years of Obama, did CBS ever show the numbers on the screen there about what a failure the Obama presidency was? Now, you know what? I put those up on the screen on a regular basis. And by the way, Ted, I did mention this to you in the interview. All of these facts were given to you, but you edited it all out. Did CBS ever put up all the laws that Hillary Clinton likely violated with her e-mail server scandal so she could avoid congressional oversight? Did CBS ever expose all the Benghazi lies of Hillary Clinton? We did on this program. Did CBS ever cover in great detail how members of the media colluded with the Clinton campaign in this election cycle? We did here. How much time did CBS devote to this phony Russian conspiracy story, even though after eight months, there isn't a shred of evidence? Now, that's the difference, Ted, between me and you. I'm honest with my audience. I don't pretend that I'm fair and balanced and objective. You do. And if you really cared about truth in journalism, how can you work for a network that only tells one side of the story? You know, how can I be bad for America when I'm offering the American people news and information nightly that your own network will not touch because they have an agenda? Now, Ted, I happen to be very proud of the work I do both on radio and TV. I'm proud of the teams that we have built here that work really hard every day to bring this audience news and information that, well, frankly, the rest of the media ignores. So I hope you enjoyed your press coverage this weekend and covering how bad I am for America while editing out 99 percent of what I said! But what you really did is prove my point, that I'm right. You exposed yourself as agenda-driven, opinionated, hypocritical, and you proved my point I've been saying since 2007-2008. Journalism is dead in America, and we have an information crisis in this country. Now, Ted, if you and CBS and CBS News have the courage, release the entire unedited footage of the interview. Let America decide. Let America see the 99 percent that you didn't want to air. Joining us now with reaction, ""Michelle Malkin Investigates"" on CRTV, Michelle Malkin. I'll tell you why they're not going to release the tape, Michelle, because -- so Ted asked the first question. I give the answer. And he -- None of that is going to air. That's what he says.

24,HANNITY," And then -- and then throughout the rest of the interview, I'm, like, provoking him. Ted, you -- Ted, you really need to include this part.

So it's not personal. The thing is, there's a level of sanctimony here that -- it reminds me of Obama clinging to Gods, guns, religion.

There's always going to be additional compromise needed, but if you can have a base framework behind the scenes before the bill is introduced to everybody, then that's the way to go. Look, you can take Marco Rubio for his word or not. When it came to the ""gang of eight,"" he spent countless hours going around and talking about his legislation before it was ever introduced.

But in a statement for a spokesman for Chairman Nunes -- they explained, quote, ""Chairman Nunes met with his source at the White House grounds in order to have proximity to a secure location where he could view the information provided by the source."" Makes sense. Joining us now with reaction, the author of the best-selling book, ""Cop Under Fire,"" Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke and Salem nationally syndicated radio talk show host Larry Elder. Larry, let me check in with your legal mind for a second. Can you think of any circumstances under which a president-elect or a candidate should ever be surveilled?",3,776.0,134.0,host,64.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-27
84,"LARRY ELDER, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST"," I can't think of anyone. And I think that what we're finding out is that Donald Trump was not out to lunch when he tweeted that he might have been wiretapped, using the term very broadly. I'd be a lot more impressed with some of these Democrats yelling and screaming about Devin Nunes if they were saying that Loretta Lynch should have recused herself when she met with Bill Clinton on the tarmac, something that she never did. I'd be a little more impressed if they were angry at Hillary for not turning over documents during the Benghazi hearing and for giving us a bunch of different stories and for deleting documents, destroying evidence after they were under subpoena. I'd be a lot more impressed if the Democrats were upset with those kinds of things, but they're not. This is nothing more than politics. They're being hypocritical. They know that they are in trouble because Donald Trump is looking at least credible, and so therefore let's put the chairman on trial. That's what they do. That's what they're doing right now.",3,1034.0,182.0,guest,65.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-27
85,HANNITY," One of the things I think that bothered me the most is the chairman saying, sheriff, that this was widely disseminated. In other words, a lot of people saw this. That goes into the issue of privacy, even if it was legitimate surveillance. And I think that is a question that needs to be answered. Let's say it was legitimate surveillance and you pick up a president-elect or a candidate. That should never be widely disseminated, right?",3,437.0,78.0,host,66.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-27
86,"SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY"," Right. Look, this is unprecedented, especially for an incoming president. The fact that Nunes briefed President Trump on this, that's what he should have done. I think the mistake he made, though, was releasing this to the public. He wanted a few headlines, he wanted some face time with the media out of it. That part of it kind of backfired on it. But I think the bigger issue here, as Larry indicated, is why the intelligence sources and intelligence agencies are surveilling the incoming president and his transition team. For what? And I think it's a shame that the intelligence agency directors there couldn't go to the president- elect and tell him what was going on. Maybe somebody should have leaked it to him without leaking any information or any names and just say, hey, there's something going on here that I think is illegal. But this is -- as Larry indicated, this is the politics as usual that goes on in Washington, the partisan back-and-forth that the American people are tired of. We sent Donald Trump to Washington to drain the swamp and to get rid of this back-and-forth stuff with politics that does nothing for the American people and get down to the business of serving the American people on the issues facing this country.",3,1249.0,219.0,guest,67.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-27
87,HANNITY," I have a lot of questions here, Larry. Did they use under the guise of legitimate intelligence gathering, legitimate surveillance, was that a ruse to really surveil the president? And the next logical question after that is who knew what, where, and when? And did the president know at the time, then President Obama? Was any of that's shared with the Clinton campaign? Where are these leaks coming from? The only felonies we know in this case were committed by leaking intelligence. That's a violation of the Espionage Act. So -- and James Comey wouldn't even acknowledge that there is an investigation into this although he did acknowledge the investigation into, quote, ""Russia"" even though there is no evidence that has been put forward whatsoever.",3,753.0,126.0,host,68.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-27
88,ELDER," That's right. I think it was Reince Priebus who said there's greater evidence of media collusion to get Hillary elected than Trump collusion with Russia to get Trump elective. And there's a whole lot we do not know. These investigations are just now getting started. And so I would urge all people to relax, look at the evidence that will come in, and find out -- James Clapper, the national intelligence director under Obama, says so far there's no evidence whatsoever of any kind of collusion with Donald Trump and with Russia. And that ultimately is what I think is going to happen. We're not going to find any evidence of collusion.",3,637.0,113.0,guest,69.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-27
89,HANNITY," Sheriff, if you were doing an investigation, don't you keep that circle tight in terms of evidence that you are gathering?

90,CLARKE," The secrecy of these investigations is paramount. I get briefed on these things all the time, Sean. But you're not going to find Barack Obama's fingerprints on this, but he is all over this. He is not stupid enough to have ordered or directed or would have be involved in any of the conversation -- might not be able to prove this, but he knew what was going on. I tell you what. I put myself in this position. If something like this was going on in Milwaukee County, in my agency, some high level investigation, and somebody didn't tell me about it, I would not be real happy about it.

You want immigration vetting of refugees -- those are your top issues and you think that should be the number one priority now.",4,307.0,56.0,host,79.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-27
106,"ANN COULTER, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST"," Well, I did care about ObamaCare-lite, and I think it is a complete disaster. I have a very simple plan to fix it which I will be launching in my column on Wednesday, so simple even a Republican congressman could understand. It's very easy to fix. I don't really hold Trump responsible for that. I do want Trump and these Republicans in Congress to enforce the Trump agenda. Instead we are getting an awful lot of the standard GOP corporatist agenda. For example, this claim that they are going to go to tax cuts next, and particularly the corporate tax rate. As you know, I would like taxes cut. As you know, I am very pro-life. I'm about at the point that I want taxes to go up and Planned Parenthood funded if this is all the Republicans are giving us. As I recall under Bush, we had massive tax cuts. Corporations, you know, they were happy. And yet what did they turn around and do? They hired guest workers. They've didn't hire Americans. They insisted on hiring illegal aliens. So I'm not sure this argument that cutting the taxes on corporations will lead to all these jobs. It leads to jobs as limiting the supply of labor by deporting illegal aliens, by building a wall. You want an infrastructure project? It reduces the number of welfare cases. It helps you with Medicaid and Medicare. Doing what Trump set on immigration makes everything else we have to do so much easier.",4,1386.0,252.0,guest,80.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-27
107,HANNITY," Listen, you don't want immigrants competing for jobs especially when you have 95 million Americans out of the labor force, but you can't deny if you bringing trillions of repatriated money at a low rate that's going to incentivize them spend money, the build factories, manufacturing centers. And the same with corporate taxes -- you lower it to 15 percent. You go from the highest corporate tax rates in the industrialized world to the lowest. Businesses are going to want to do business here. That only helps us too, right?",4,526.0,91.0,host,81.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-27
108,COULTER, Maybe. I'm not very inclined to worry about corporate America right now. That's all anybody has worried about. The whole point of Trump was to care about the working class.,4,173.0,31.0,guest,82.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-27

110,COULTER," And as I say -- well, yes, all those jobs they created under Bush? No, they didn't. They brought in guest workers. They demanded an amnesty.",4,141.0,27.0,guest,84.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-27

112,COULTER," Not simultaneously, number one. And I would also say that having seen that we are going to be living under -- in fact we are going to live under fascism under Trump, it's the fascism of our federal district court judges, immigration is obviously the federal responsibility. But some district court judges don't understand that. And as long as they are going to be deciding all of our immigration policy for us, I think the first law Congress ought the pass is just take Trump's immigration policy paper and pass every provision into law. As I've said before Trump was very clever about this. Almost everything he has promised on immigration already is the law. It is 100 percent within the prerogative of the president --",4,722.0,127.0,guest,86.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-27
113,HANNITY, Why does he have to go back and do it again? Why would you advise him to --,4,76.0,19.0,host,87.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-27
114,COULTER," Because everything he wants to do is his responsibility as the president. For example, to build the wall. He's commander-in-chief. It's not just the law. It's the constitution that gives the president the authority to protect our borders. But apparently some federal district judges need more than the constitution. They will ignore the constitution. Why not have Congress, for one thing, just for supplemental support on all of Trump's immigration policies, pass all of his immigration policies into law, and also force the Democrats and some of those weak-kneed Republicans to vote against it. I keep hearing what Reince Priebus said this weekend, that the new White House plan is to appeal to Democrats, and reach out to Democrats. And look, Trump is a charming person. I'm sure he will be lovely to them, but I think instead of trying to get Democrat votes by giving into them, by pushing socialist ideas, the way you get Democrats to vote for your bills is by writing bills that they can't vote against because they have to stand for reelection, as you will see with my Obamacare fix this Wednesday.",4,1105.0,189.0,guest,88.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-27

0,"SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST"," Welcome to Hannity. In just a few minutes, we'll check in with Newt Gingrich, Monica Crowley and Ainsley Earhardt.  But first, the House Intelligence Committee continues its ongoing investigation into whether Russia meddled in our Presidential Election. Earlier, President Trump, he called out the Clinton's for their alleged ties to Russia. It's the story that the all-left radical anti-Trump propaganda media will not be covering but we will, and that is tonight's ""Opening Monologue"". All right. So, last night, President Trump, he took to Twitter and he wrote, ""Why isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech money to Bill, the Hillary Russian ""reset,"" praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian Company. Trump-Russia story is a hoax. Make America great again.""  Now, putting aside the embarrassing Russian reset strategy that Hillary Clinton tried and failed to enact as Secretary of State. That's irrelevant right now. Tonight, I want to focus directly on what could be the single- most damning connection between the Clintons and Russia. In other words, the rarely covered scandal. Ted Koppel probably didn't cover it. Now tonight, for weeks now we've been telling you there is zero evidence of this eight-month-old media conspiracy narrative that President Trump and his campaign were secretly colluding with Putin and the Russians. Zero evidence. Now tonight, I want to focus on the real scandal that is rarely covered by this all-left propaganda destroy Trump media, and it does involve the Clintons and an enormous mining company called ""Uranium One"".  Let me give you some background. Uranium One is a Canadian-based multi- national operation. Now, they extract Uranium, which of course, is a key material that's used in nuclear weapons. They do it from Asia, Africa, and Australia. Now, Uranium One is responsible for one-fifth of all Uranium production right here in the United States.  Here's the back story. Back in 2013, a company directly tied to the Russian government purchased Uranium One, a move, by the way, that was approved impart by Hillary Clinton's State Department. That's a very big deal. Now, this move allowed Russia and Vladimir Putin to control 20 percent of all Uranium production right here in the United States. And you're thinking, ""That sounds weird"", right? If you haven't heard this before, you're probably watching the mainstream media. And it gets a lot worse. In 2015, even the New York Times, they broke a bombshell report, the headline was ""Cash Flowed To Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal"". Now, according to the Times' findings, Ian Telfer who was the chairman of Uranium One, made huge, massive donations to the Clinton Foundation. Now, the Times writes, ""As the Russians gradually assume control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show a massive flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation."" And while millions of dollars flowed into the Clinton Foundation from the chairman of Uranium One. The Times also reported that Bill Clinton racked up massive huge speaking fees in Moscow. The Times writes, ""Shortly after the Russians announced their intentions to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock."" Now, right here on this program, Clinton cash best-selling author Peter Schweitzer. He provided even more damning information into the Clinton connections Uranium One. Remember, Putin and Russia as a result of Hillary Clinton signing off, millions of dollars going to Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton, they got 20 percent of all uranium as a result of this deal.

6,HANNITY," Massive amount of money. They got a huge payback, and they now control 20 percent of America's uranium. Now, here's a big question, ""Why aren't the Democrats that have been pushing the theory that's false with no evidence for eight months? Why aren't members of the all-radical left destroy Trump media? Why aren't they worried about what is the real alleged Russian Association?  They're so worried about Russia meddling in the election. Isn't this far more worthy of an investigation? I wouldn't hold your breath. Now meanwhile, liberal lawmakers, they're not trying to impugn the character of the House Intelligence Committee chair, and that's Devin Nunes. Now, last week, Democrats were outraged after the congressman announced that he had briefed the president on new information he had received that proved the Obama administration did in fact surveil President-elect Trump and his transition team. Now, on this program, Chairman Nunes said it was his duty to inform the president. Yesterday, Democrats up in arms because they learned that Nunes met his source on the White House grounds. All right. It sounds nefarious, not really. Congressman Nunes said he did it in order to be near a secure location where he could properly view the material provided by his source, but that's not good enough for liberal democratic snowflake lawmakers. Many, like House Minority Leader Pelosi, are now calling for Nunes to recuse himself like Senator Snowflake Schumer calling from to be replaced. This is nuts.

21,HANNITY," And earlier today, Speaker Ryan was asked if Nunes should recuse himself. He said, ""No. Congressman Nunes better be ready because the Democrats, they'll pull out every dirty trick out of their hat to impugn his character and his integrity. The real story the media won't tell you. That's what this is about. You want corruption? Look at the Hillary Clinton Foundation, the Clinton family foundation. Look at the money that went in Bill's pocket, and she had to sign off 20 percent of America's uranium going to Putin and Russia? Oh, I thought the media was concerned about this.  Here with reaction, author of the bestseller ""Treason"" Fox contributor, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Mr. Speaker, we got one donation, $31 million from this Canadian Frankie Astra who went to Kazakhstan with Bill Clinton, and this was in the lead up to the deal. And then also, when you look at the money that was given over a period of time, millions were donated to the Clinton Foundation. Bill gets twice as general speaking fee and Hillary signed off on Russia getting 20 percent of America's uranium, which is used to make nuclear weapons. What are your thoughts?",1,1156.0,201.0,host,16.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
22,"NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," You know, well, look, I think it's very strange that both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are chaired by Republicans and yet all the noise is about phony charges involving Donald Trump. I mean, you have real evidence, as you pointed out, Peter Schweitzer's book is amazing. Since then, we've had all the WikiLeaks; we have an enormous amount of evidence. Man, I do think it's legitimate for the American people to want to know about all this foreign money, where is it going, who's it going to, et cetera.  But, I think, a totally one-sided witch hunt by the elite media spurred on by liberals inside the permanent bureaucracy and then with the shrill partisanship of Schumer and Pelosi, neither of them to the best of my knowledge, ever called for an investigation of Bill Clinton's money and investigation of Uranium One, an investigation of all the different dealings. I think the country deserves a really thorough exploration of the issue of foreign money gradually corrupting our system, but that ought to be an even-handed serious look, and it has to include as part of it, really delving into the Clintons and their network of millions and millions of dollars. And I'm frankly mystified why the Republican leadership in both the House and the Senate have been so timid and so unwilling to just open up a straight out investigation.",1,1353.0,234.0,guest,17.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
23,HANNITY," Yes, that's a great question. It seems, to me, that's a quid pro quo, a Secretary of State signs off on letting Russia have ownership of 20 percent of our uranium? That is insanity me. And if Donald Trump did it, I guarantee you that what is now an eight-month-no- evidence conspiracy, it would be Watergate on steroids. Let me ask you this, we now learn from James Rosen and John Solomon and Sarah Carter, all investigative journalists for decades of experience that, in fact, there was surveillance at Trump Tower, and went on in November, December and January, and it may have even happened before the election. Time will tell.  Shouldn't that concern every American that their surveillance and that probably the sitting president at the time, President Obama and his closest aides, knew exactly what's going on in Trump Tower, and they didn't tell him? ",1,858.0,150.0,host,18.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
24,GINGRICH," Well, look, I think this whole process should concern everybody. The use of the intelligent systems, the level of hostility to Trump, the number of leaks, which are felonies are clearly illegal. The whole process by which the President Obama apparently - I mean, we only look at the decision memos, who decided that they would - because remember, these are not hard serious facts, they've changed the rules so you could pick up the dumbest, weirdest gossip, and now you're going to distribute it to all the different agencies knowing that making of that available almost guarantees it will leak. I mean, there's something -- this is all done in early January after they lost the election, and there's a whole series of these kind of things where you have to believe that the deep state and the Obama team were in collusion, doing things designed to undermine and weaken the person who the American people had elected to be president. I think it's very troubling. And I think it deserves very serious investigation.",1,1015.0,176.0,guest,19.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
25,HANNITY," Let me ask an important question, though, about healthcare. I think this was mishandled from the start. In other words, nobody in the Congress got to see the bill that was being scored by the CBO. It -- consensus was not built ahead of time. Rumors came out before the bill was released, people were vocal about expressing - I hope that's not in there. I hope that's not in there. Then, a public Civil War emerges on T.V. because there is such disagreement. All right. What's the right thing for them to do now because this was a major promise? They had eight years to do this. To me, I think it was rolled out in the worst way imaginable. I'm holding them accountable like I promised. How can they fix this?",1,709.0,134.0,host,20.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
26,GINGRICH," Well, first of all, I just put on foxnews.com a fairly long outline of exactly what went wrong and exactly what we should now do drawing on the lessons of Eisenhower, Reagan Thatcher and what we did with the contract with America. I think that they - first of all, I think they should pick up immediately and work on infrastructure because it will bring Democrats in to talk in a serious practical way about working together.  That opens the door to have Democrats talking about the tax bill. That sets the stage for a totally new approach to healthcare.

The Senator from Montana has a real problem. I can go down the list.

45,HANNITY," Hi, welcome back to ""Hannity."" So, last night in this program, I told you a CBS NEWS veteran, Ted Koppel, said I was, quote, ""bad for America."" They only aired 70 seconds of what was like a 50-minute-sit-down interview that was taped earlier this month. Well, this was not the first time that CBS has been called out for editing interviews.  Now, back in September of 2012, after the Benghazi attack in Libya that killed four Americans, CBS sat down with President Obama the day after that attack. But when they first aired the interview, they didn't get into any details about Benghazi.  Now, fast-forward, about a month during a debate with Mitt Romney, well, President Obama was challenged on whether or not he had called the Benghazi attack a ""terror attack"" from the very beginning. The president said he did. Romney said he did not. Three days later, CBS, they came to the rescue and they aired a previously unaired clip from their interview with the president where he said this.

You've talked about failures and communication and strategy in the current administration, and the challenges that they face. And you're also a conservative. You're very candid that you're a conservative. The problem with CBS and so many other news organizations is that they will mask the fact that most of the people working for the network -- most, not all, but most -- are liberals. The way they choose stories, the way they produce stories, the way they choose not to cover certain stories, is always going to be done through a more liberal perspective in a liberal lens.  And you don't make any bones about the fact that you're a conservative. A totally different way to analyze the situation, but that doesn't -- to make those more nuanced points, that kind of blurs what CBS really wants to do here. They want to delegitimize you. Ted Koppel, he's been up to this old trick, delegitimizing Fox, he's been up to this for years. He's been giving interviews about how bad journalism today is for -- really for years and years.

93,INGRAHAM," Think about the Rockville rape case. These thugs were allowed to go free at the border, allowed to go free. They were held for a week and then released to their, quote, ""sponsors."" When this happens under any president's watch, under any homeland security secretary, this policy, when this occurs, the individuals responsible for this policy -- I think they have blood on their hands. I really do.  We have enough problems in the United States, enough crime committed by American citizens -- even if it's down in some cities, I understand that, and that is good news. But in places like Baltimore, in places like Chicago, L.A., the poorest Americans, the working poor who have already been dealt a difficult hand in many circumstances -- now we go to them and say, you know, we know a lot of these jobs, a lot of those were shipped overseas, but now we are going to put the welcome mat out for all these illegal immigrants, many of them bringing in gang affiliations, drugs, and other problems, we are going to bring them in, and we're going to see how your life turns out because we feel like it is our noble duty to resist Donald Trump.

104,HANNITY," That was President Trump speaking earlier today after keeping yet another campaign promise by signing a new energy independence executive order that will roll back the Obama administration's energy regulations. Here with reaction, the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt is with us. ",4,307.0,45.0,host,74.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
105,"SCOTT PRUITT, EPA ADMINISTRATOR"," Hi, Sean.",4,10.0,3.0,guest,75.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
106,HANNITY," Sir, I have been saying for years, we have all this natural gas and coal and oil underneath our feet and we are begging countries that hate us for our energy, the lifeblood of our economy. Explain what this executive order will do and what it means for America's goal towards energy independence. ",4,298.0,55.0,host,76.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
107,PRUITT," Sean, what a great day at the EPA today. The president, as you indicated, came to our agency and signed an executive order, and how wonderful it was to see a collection of coal miners from across the country stand behind the president as he signed that executive order because it was a message across the country that we are going to do exactly what you said, Sean. Make sure that we are good stewards of natural resources that we've been blessed with as a country, that actually harvest and use those resources to bless the American people.  And so it's a great day to make sure that we send a very pro-growth, pro- environment message. And that's what started today with the president's executive order. ",4,707.0,129.0,guest,77.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
108,HANNITY," Let me ask. It's very interesting. If you listen to the left, especially Al Gore, this is the same Al Gore, sir, that I caught on a gulfstream three which is one of the least energy efficient models of private aircraft in the sky. Then he'd get off with only two people. It seats 15 or 16. He got off the plane into his private limo. So I guess he bought carbon offsets. But he recently suggested the civil war in Syria and Brexit are caused by climate change. How do you answer this insanity? ",4,495.0,97.0,host,78.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
109,PRUITT," I think that is a keyword, Sean. There has been a lack of common sense, a lack of sanity with respect with how we've done regulations in this country in the last couple years. Until this past administration the Environmental Protection Agency worked with states across the country to advance an environmental agenda that was about clean air and clean water, but it also understood that we didn't need to be antagonistic to economic growth and jobs.  Since 1980, Sean, we have seen a 65 percent reduction in air pollutants across this country while at the same time growing an economy. So it was this past administration that made us put on jerseys. It was this past administration that said if you are pro-environment, you are anti-energy. If you're pro-energy, you are anti-environment. The president is saying we are going to reject that narrative. We're going to have a different path forward. We are going to be pro-growth and pro-jobs and pro-environment and get back to the core EPA originalism, if you will, Sean, the core mission of the agency, advancing air quality, advancing water quality, but doing so with the sensitivity to create jobs. ",4,1152.0,198.0,guest,79.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
110,HANNITY," Sir, many years ago I was a contractor and I bought an old providence gas company van. It was the best $200 I ever spent in my life. It did have some body damage, but I fixed that myself. I was able to do it. It was a vehicle that had a run -- this was back in the early '80s, that used to be run on natural gas. It runs cleaner, as I understand it, than, for example, gasoline, and we have more than the entire Middle East has oil combined. Do you see America maybe moving towards natural gas run vehicles? How much with the average American save and how many jobs would be created? ",4,585.0,119.0,host,80.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
111,PRUITT," I think that's happening. We are in the process of that technological revolution if you will, Sean. What the president did today that I think was very key is he declared an end to the war on coal. He declared an end to the war on fossil fuels. He recognized that we've been blessed as a nation with natural gas, oil, coal, renewables, nuclear, and the rest. And we're going to make sure that we use all forms of energy to generate electricity so we can grow our manufacturing base. But as you indicated, Sean, giving consumers the option with respect to fuel efficiency and choosing vehicles that are run on natural gas. But we need to have a renewed focus with hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, making sure we take advantage of natural gas but also the coal industry and the rest. The last administration picked winners and losers. ",4,846.0,152.0,guest,81.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
112,HANNITY," And how many millions of jobs will be created do you think? If we go with this all the above strategy, because energy is the lifeblood of any economy, how many years would it take America to become fully energy independent, and how many jobs will be created if we keep clean coal and natural gas and drilling and maybe even nuclear at some point, and by the way, new developments and new technologies that emerge as well? ",4,423.0,80.0,host,82.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
113,PRUITT," When you think about, Sean, the announcement last week with the keystone pipeline. What is great about what the president did today is it is going to unleash an American spirit with respect to energy innovation in the transportation network -- ",4,245.0,43.0,guest,83.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
114,HANNITY, Can you guess how many millions of jobs might be created? ,4,59.0,13.0,host,84.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
115,PRUITT," You really can't because the manufacturing base is going to be reinvigorated. We're going to keep these jobs in this country. And again, the coal miners that were at the EPA meeting today is they heard the president speak, they were very emotional because their industry has been under assault for last several years.  And so for the first time in a long time, Sean, when you talk about optimism, there's optimism and hope that we're going to create jobs across all sectors of the economy because of what the president did today. ",4,531.0,96.0,guest,85.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28

You are not allowed to drink anymore on the beach in Panama City. They are bringing kegs on the beach. Four people died during Texas week. Texas week is the biggest week in the month of March. They call it Texas week because most of the universities have spring break that week. It is between March 11th and March 18th.

167,HANNITY," Look, some are freshman, some of sophomores. They are not 21, and all this is going on. The biggest thing, and we got into this a little bit last night, is people outside of the area, really bad people, they come in and it their idea is to prey. You went into how, for example, nobody knows they are selling, quote, ""ecstasy."" It is not ecstasy. They're selling molly. It's not molly. We don't even know what's in these drugs. ",5,428.0,82.0,host,132.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28
168,EARHARDT, That is twofold. We do not know what is in the drugs because they are synthetic and it's not exactly the same makeup with every batch. Therefore the officers last year were telling me down in Panama City that what happens there is you can't arrest someone necessarily because it does not test as cocaine. It doesn't test positive as molly. They don't even know what's in these drugs. It's just a combination of stuff. So you are trusting these drug dealers to sell you stuff and you could die because no one knows what is in the drugs. ,5,537.0,101.0,guest,133.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-28

So it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy that the Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about their -- the staff, the Trump staff's dealing with Russians, that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence. So I became very worried because not enough was coming out into the open, and I knew that there was more. We have very good intelligence on Russia.

16,HANNITY," All right, let's go backwards. Surveillance, unmasking, intelligence leaking all acknowledged in that tape by Evelyn Farkas. Now, for days, we have been asking on this program, who knew what, when and where? So did Obama officials commit a crime here? And how did Evelyn Farkas, a former relatively low-ranking Obama administration official, how did she know about all this surveillance? Now, that brings us to another big story tonight. For weeks, right here on this program, Sara Carter, John Solomon from Circa News, they have been doing excellent reporting on the surveillance story. Now, they uncovered the existence of an FBI investigation into a server that was being utilized by Trump Tower. By the way, that's where the campaign was. They also discovered a FISA warrant that allowed federal officials to capture Trump team communications. Now, prior to the president taking office, all this occurred.  Now they have another bombshell report and it shows high-ranking officials with direct access to President Obama may have had access to unmasked federal surveillance of the Trump transition and their team members, and may have briefed President Obama himself about the information they were collecting on then President-elect Trump. Now, my predictions is that as each day goes by, more and more information will be becoming available. And soon, we're going to have the answer to these very important questions. Joining us now with their explosive report, from Circa News, Sara Carter, John Solomon. Thank you, John, especially, for making a rare appearance. Sara's been doing all the heavy lifting on the show.",1,1623.0,262.0,host,9.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-29

19,HANNITY," This is very important. Now, how is it that Evelyn Farkas, Sara, who left the administration, is talking specifically about surveillance? It seems like she's admitting the surveillance that you've been reporting on and John's been reporting on that took place of Trump transition team members. She's admitting that they unmasked them because they're Trump transition team members.

20,"SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS"," My thoughts are, you know, with the story that John and I broke today with regards to how the Obama administration loosened a lot of the regulations that protected the privacy of Americans - - I mean, this is going back all the way to 2011. Remember, everyone thought for a long time and once it was revealed that in January, when Obama expanded executive order 12333 to all the agencies, everybody was just focused on that. But nobody was focusing on what happened before that. And I think what John and I were able to show was that, look, it didn't happen just in January. That expanded it even further into all 16 agencies. But in 2011, there was already the unraveling of what we consider our privacy rights. And then again in 2015, it happened again. So they were already set up to look at these unredacted, unmasked transcripts between Americans and foreign officials or foreigners to foreigner, you know, that were talking about Americans.

John, I'll throw this to you because Evelyn also served as an adviser to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign, according to one report was up for a position if she had won. So she's out in 2015. We're talking about 2016 here. How would somebody that was once a rather low-level official -- no offense to her, she's serving her country. How would she have known that there was surveillance of Trump and the transition team? If you break down -- if they found out how we knew what we knew about the Trump staff dealing with the Russians -- wow! How would she possibly know that outside of government now?",1,651.0,120.0,host,15.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-29
24,SOLOMON," Yes, that's a really great question. And her appearance raises more questions than we have answers to right now.

It could be some of the information she has isn't classified at all, though she used the word ""intelligence,"" so that's a red flag, right? I think her appearance on that show is going to raise a lot of questions, and we may not know the answers to them for a little bit of time, but there certainly -- there's certainly some important questions that she's raised in that appearance.",1,562.0,99.0,guest,22.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-29

We now have confirmed through you guys, James Rosen here at FOX News, and I think this also backs this up. Trump was surveilled. He was right in his tweet that he sent out that day.  If we go back to Watergate and we look at Watergate, wasn't that about a break-in, about a political opponent? Didn't that become a big scandal and a president resigned? My question to both of you, do you think, based on where this story is now, this has the potential of being even bigger? If we're talking about surveillance, unmasking, leaking intelligence, even bigger than Watergate? Is that a possibility where this ends up?

And the story that we broke today, if you're a Republican, a Democrat, an independent, you should be really concerned how easy it is today that large numbers of members of the government for a very low threshold can ask the NSA, Hey, if you intercepted John Solomon or Sean Hannity, could you unmask his name because we're trying to understand this intelligence.

We continue with Circa News's Sara Carter and John Solomon.  All right, so your piece today -- let's -- let's start at the beginning. As his presidency drew to a close, Barack Obama's to aides routinely reviewed intelligence reports gleaned from the National Security Agency's incidental intercepts of Americans abroad, taking advantage of the rules that their boss relaxed starting in 2011 to help government better fight terrorism, espionage, et cetera. Were they using -- under the guise, Sara of -- of protecting the country and legitimate surveillance of America's enemies, friends, foes -- were they using that as a ruse to tap into Donald Trump's transition team in Trump Tower, do you think? Is that a possibility?",2,930.0,150.0,host,56.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-29
66,CARTER," I think that's the concern that a lot of the sources that have spoken to John and I have. I mean, their concern is, Look, we want to be able to go after the terrorists. We want to be able to find these hackers and cyber-espionage and counterespionage. We need this. But are people using this as a back door to actually spy on Americans? Is this being politicized? Is this political espionage?  And that's the question that we all need to be asking. And we all need to kind of understand that civil liberties here are being -- in a sense being violated, if what our sources are saying is true.",2,593.0,114.0,guest,57.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-29

We know that could -- this unmasking could be used for abusive or political purposes, and that's why we try to put strict rules in place. But when those rules get loosened, the potential goes up for abuse or political espionage.

I mean, here you have this Evelyn Farkas going back -- when you tie that into your story that they're loosening these rules, how does somebody who's working for Hillary, who left the Obama administration, possibly know about surveillance or potential surveillance at Trump Tower and the need to get this information to her friends on the Hill because it might disappear once Donald Trump becomes president?

Who leaked her that information? That's number one. Number two, this -- we were concerned that the Obama administration officials involved in this would be known by the Trump administration. Well, guess what? The president of the United States is Donald Trump, so of course, he would know that. So then it brings up the third issue, and the third issue is here, what in the world did they think that they had that they could justify doing this? And Sean, I said on your program weeks ago -- Loretta Lynch, John Brennan - - these were the ones to be looking at. Look who signed off on these orders. Look who wanted this unmasking.

109,"TOM FITTON, JUDICIAL WATCH"," Well, you know, as Jay -- you know, I'm not a lawyer, but I've been doing this scandal work for 20 years almost. And I know the hallmarks of a scandal. You've got administration officials working improperly with outside former officials to launder information -- launder -- launder information that they're are not allowed to send out and around. This reminds me of the FBI ""file-gate"" scandal under Clinton, where they were looking at raw data from FBI files in White House, or at least had access to it. Here they were accessing raw intelligence data that was arguably protected by the Privacy Act and other laws, if you violate, require criminal sanctions, in theory.  And then they're also working with Congress on this. So here you've got the elements of the scandal and where this investigations need to go, not only criminal investigation but getting back to this so-called congressional investigation whether by intelligence committee or select committee, this is what they need to look at. Who the Obama administration was working with on the outside and the inside to improperly disseminate this classified material. ",3,1128.0,189.0,guest,97.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-29

115,SEKULOW," Of course. So how did this level a person outside of government end up with unmasked intelligence on the president of the United States or his team? How in the world -- how did Loretta Lynch, who, by the way, doesn't mind meeting on an airplane with President Clinton, how does she justify having this out there? How did she justify this signoff, and then how did this individual, this Miss Farkas, get this information? And then friends on the Hill, what are they talking about?

117,SEKULOW," Yes, she wanted to make sure it was there so that the Trump administration didn't destroy it or some statement like that.  Here's the concern. The concern is the intelligence apparatus in the United States has rules that they have to follow like every other agency. And it appears that in the waning days or maybe the last year of the former administration, they viewed those laws as advisory opinions and not laws.

And I go back to James Comey who just a couple days ago goes on air in a hearing in Congress and says we are investigating Trump associates in Russia, but of course he never wants to disclose an investigation. Then asked if in fact he was investigating the leaks of classified information -- what his real response was, what he actually said was not that he was doing an investigation. He said I'm not willing to say that because I'm not willing to say they were classified.  Now, everybody at this point knows it is classified information but that is how they are playing it, that close. And that the Republicans need to do is ask the next question. For instance, when the president tweeted out in quotes ""wiretapped,"" which we all know is surveillance, why didn't anybody at that hearing say let's put the wiretap portion of it, which hardly use - - ",3,858.0,159.0,guest,109.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-29

124,FITTON," The leadership of the FBI is a real problem.

I'm like, well, why am I here? And then for the rest of the interview, I'm taunting him. Ted, are you going to include this? Ted, are you going to include that? Ted, I think you really need to include what I just said here and here and here. And so they don't want to show that because it exposes what I'm calling edited fake news.

150,CONCHA," Matt, just one point on that.

155,SCHLAPP," On the other piece, on the editing of Bill Clinton, this is particularly egregious. This happened at a point in the campaign where a lot of people were worried about Hillary Clinton's health. If you looked at both videos of her stumbling into that band or being basically carried into that van or being basically carried into that van, this raised real questions about her honesty, her honesty about her health, what was the situation of her health, could she serve a full term. And there was no question that they did everything they could to fix Bill Clinton's interview because, I guess it depends on what the word ""frequently"" means, because he started off by interview being honest, and it really just reiterated -- it would have reiterated the concern people had in their minds over his wife's health. ",4,809.0,142.0,guest,137.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-29
156,CONCHA," There was one more error in that interview where Ted Koppel said ""Let me finish my sentence and then you can talk."" And he said something along the lines of your audience wants ideology over facts, and then your response was never allowed. An interview never ends with the interviewer making the final point. The interviewee should. ",4,334.0,59.0,guest,138.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-29
157,HANNITY," Does it really bother me? No. Do I hate Ted Koppel? No. But, you know what, it gave I think America an opportunity to see these games that the media has been playing.

164,HANNITY," That was the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, earlier this week discussing the deadly cost of sanctuary cities that they have on the country. On this program over the years we have highlighted families who have been victimized by criminal illegal aliens. And as Fox News has been covering, according to reports, two immigrants from Central America, 18- year-old immigrant Henry Sanchez Milian, pictured right there, and 17-year- old Jose Montano allegedly brutally raped a 14-year-old girl in a bathroom stall at a high school in Maryland. Now, attorneys for the accused, they are saying the sex was consensual and they're claiming the girl agreed to have sex in text messages, while police claim that the sex was forced.  Joining us now with reaction, Fox News contributor Herman Cain. We weren't there, we don't know. This sounds really fishy to me in a lot of ways. But the bigger picture is we have Americans being killed, Americans the victims of rape, and we have criminal aliens -- I interviewed a father yesterday. His son was killed by an illegal immigrant, Herman, that had held woman hostage for a week and raped her. And they let this guy go, and then they killed this kid that was working overnight at a convenience store. ",5,1237.0,214.0,host,143.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-29
165,"HERMAN CAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," Sean, this is another despicable incident why we need to keep illegals out of the country and get illegals out of the country.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions was exactly right. Too many Americans have died because of illegals in this country. But what the Democrats do is they try to gloss over this and make it sound as if it is about being against everybody that is here. What the Trump administration is trying to do is to try to minimize the number of illegals in order to hopefully prevent an incident like the one that happened in Maryland.  Now, this attorney is planting a seed even before the trial begins, in order to try to defend these two illegals. It's despicable, and I totally support what Attorney General Sessions and the Trump administration is trying to do. ",5,780.0,142.0,guest,144.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-29
166,HANNITY," Let me put up on the side of the screen, and I will read them as I put them up here, Herman. We have according to a July report in 2015, the Migration Policy Institute, 820,000 illegal immigrants are convicted criminals. We have another one. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, in 2015, 36.6 percent of federal offenses were committed by illegal aliens.  Then you've got in Texas alone, between June of 2011 and February of 2017, there was 1,162 homicide charges filed against illegal aliens. In Texas alone, 2011 through 2017, 68,151 assaults. And you go further. Texas alone between the same years, you've got 6,098 sexual assault charges filed against illegals.  And I, for the life of me, if you are Mayor Rahm ""Rahm-bo"" ""Dead Fish"" or ""Comrade de Blasio"" or the L.A. mayor or a San Francisco politician, how do you get away with aiding and abetting people that we know where break the law?

We now have a president and an administration that says it's not OK to break the law. Now, here is what they are not talking about. Defunding these cities -- if they don't cooperate with the federal agencies, that is just step one. They could be indicted. Nobody's talking about that. They are breaking the law if they do not work with federal agencies in order to enforce the laws on the books. That's all this administration is trying to do.

Now, try as she might, Dr. Farkas cannot walk back her original comments. And today, we have also uncovered an interview that Dr. Farkas did back in February with VOX before that appearance on NBC. She was asked by Ezra Klein what her, quote, ""level of alarm"" was after Flynn's resignation. Here's Farkas's response. Quote, ""Well, (ph) it's lower than it's been since the summer when I was first made aware of all this stuff. I'm, like, 'Finally, everybody else sees it!' Seriously. The reason I was so upset last summer was that I was getting winks and hints from inside that there was something really wrong here. I was agitated because I knew the Clinton campaign and the world didn't know. But I didn't think it would happen this fast. I didn't think Flynn would survive a year, but I thought it would be most of the year."" Well, did she know about Flynn, the intelligence that eventually got leaked that took him out? What is she talking about here? Anyway, who was giving her the winks and the hints over the summer? I'm just asking questions based on her own words.  Here's where it gets interesting.

34,HANNITY," Maybe the Russians put these words in my mouth, asking about surveillance, unmasking and leaking intelligence. I'm simply asking questions based on what she said, as other members of the mainstream media, by the way, continue to ignore the facts in this case. The media doesn't want to focus on this today. Oh no, they want to focus on the New York Times headline that came out late this afternoon, ""Two White House officials helped give Nunes intelligence reports.""  Now, the headline is deceptive, obscure, and I would argue purposely dishonest. If you read further into the report, it isn't really a story. It just says the official, quote, ""played a role."" Now, tonight, I'm calling on the intel community, stop being distracted by the hate Trump media, destroy Trump media. The attorney general, General Sessions, needs to convene a grand jury. And the only thing we know for sure is that the intel was leaked about retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. That is a felony. That is a crime.  And as for Dr. Farkas, well, we need to know what she knew about the unmasking, about the surveillance, and when she knew it and who she was communicating with and who was giving her the information. And what did she know also about leaking or getting the information to her friends on the Hill?

I mean, I am from looking at foreign influence in the American political governmental system. I think there's a grave danger that destroyed the Roman republic of money just pouring in to a corrupt the system.  But I want to see it done fairly, out in the open.

She talks about surveillance of the Trump campaign, and if they knew what we knew what we know and how we knew it, and then when she talks about unmasking about the Trump folks, that would be unmasking, and then the next thing is, Well, you know, gather as much intelligence and get it to our friends on the Hill here -- it seems to me that this has gone much deeper than anybody else in the media is willing to talk about.

Also, Laura Ingraham is here to weigh in on the surveillance of the Trump campaign and the unmasking, and of course, the leaks and also Republican infighting.

53,HANNITY," And welcome back to ""Hannity."" So the Republican Party continues feuding, and now the alt left propaganda destroy Trump media -- they have a new favorite talking point. President Trump is ineffective. He can't get things done. Now, it's time to put that narrative to rest. And that's tonight's mini-monologue.  All right, so after the House Republican leadership's plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare stalled in Congress, well, the mainstream media, they want you to think the Trump presidency's dead in the water.  Well, since taking office, the president has been checking off -- look at that -- all the items on his list, all his campaign promises one by one. Take a look. They're right there on your screen. Now, it's very obvious that the president has been moving very fast and effectively at what I call the speed of Trump. And now after the Republican health care plan did stall in the House with infighting in the Republican Party, there is a danger that could undermine the president's agenda.  Now, earlier today, the president tweeted, quote, ""The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda. If they don't get on the team and fast, we must fight them and Dems in 2018.""  Now, the president's clearly frustrated with this division in the Republican Party. On this show, we promised we're holding everyone in Washington accountable. For seven long years, the GOP ran on repealing, replacing ObamaCare. They said, ""Give us the House."" They got that in 2010. ""Give us the House and Senate."" They got it in 2014. ""Give us the House, Senate and the presidency."" They got that on November 8th. They got their wish. Now, in my opinion, it's not the Freedom Caucus that's responsible for the GOP failure in this case to repeal and replace ObamaCare. Now, this legislation was flawed from the beginning. It was created behind closed doors. Not one single member saw the bill until it was rolled out, and that made it a disaster. Now, I don't know who's telling the White House to focus their anger on the Freedom Caucus, but I do think it's misplaced, because the Freedom Caucus -- I've talked to them. They want to make a deal and they want the win for the president and the country.  So my advice tonight to Speaker Ryan, the rest of Congress is simple: House leadership, you need to get all the differing factions in your caucus together. Get them together with senators like Rand Paul and Mike Lee and Mitch McConnell and Secretary Price.  I've said this before. Get all the factions, the moderates, the Tuesday Group, the Study Group, the Freedom Caucus. Get everybody in a room, lock the door, order pizza, get beer, get ice cream. I don't care if you include coloring books. Get a consensus bill like you've been promising the country for eight years, and get it done and get it on the president's desk.  That is your mission. Follow your mission and your promise. It's not ideology. It's what's good for the American people and the promise you made to everybody. We continue with former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. Mr. Speaker, how do you roll out a bill and not show one member of the House what's in the bill? How do you not appeal to moderates...",2,3180.0,565.0,host,38.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-30

56,GINGRICH," Well, I was going to say, as you know, my newsletter that came out yesterday was posted on FOX News (INAUDIBLE) .com and came out of Gingrich Productions. I outlined exactly the mistakes that were made. This was an astonishing failure to follow what Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher taught us, to follow what we did so successfully during the Contract With America Congress.  First, you have to win the argument in the country. These guys were talking process. The Democrats were talking health care. Process never wins in a debate with the American people because they don't care. That's not their job.  Second, you have to have something that people can believe in and understand, and it cannot be so complicated that nobody understands it except technical wonks. Third, you cannot write a bill -- and I'm very worried that they have learned nothing and that they're going to go right back and try to do this again. You cannot write a bill designed around the very arcane Senate reconciliation rules and around the Congressional Budget Office's totally fake scoring and get anything that you can explain to the American people. So I outlined a road ahead. I think there is a way to get this done. But it starts with something that's a major argument. And that is, I believe if you designed the right bill, if it did the right things for rural America, you'd get a lot of Democrats to vote for it because people back home would want it. And there seems to be this automatic belief that Republicans can't write a bill that's popular and communicate it enough to win the argument, so they got to find some gimmick. Friday, the Freedom Caucus actually blocked the Republicans from throwing away their majority. If they had voted for a bill that was at 17 percent approval, they would have given every Democratic consultant in the country 10 or 12 ads to run. ""Hillary care"" broke 40 years of Democratic control. ObamaCare led to the Democratic Party defeat in 2010. A vote on Friday might well have been the end of the Republican majority in the House. I am very concerned about where they're at right now.",2,2108.0,374.0,guest,41.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-30
57,HANNITY," I'm very concerned that they didn't have the sense to work on a bill knowing that it's a coalition party. The Democratic Party's a coalition party.  Look, you're right about process. The average American has no idea what reconciliation is, or cloture or the Byrd rule, and they don't care. This is what they want to know. Am I going to have better care at a lower cost for me and my family? And that's it. And if this bill doesn't get that done, and you can't communicate it and you don't have consensus to pass it, why did they unveil it and why did they keep it secret?",2,572.0,111.0,host,42.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-30
58,GINGRICH," Well, and to make it even worse, in the age of Donald J. Trump, who was elected as an outsider because people don't trust Washington, their answer for a lot of questions was, Well, there's going to be a part two and a part three. Trust us. Well, nobody in this country elected the current president to trust people. His job is to make sure that it's accountable to the American people, that it's verifiable. But I do think the establishment is working overtime to try to drive a wedge between President Trump and the Freedom Caucus in order to move President Trump towards the center. I think it'll backfire. I think you'll figure it out.",2,639.0,117.0,guest,43.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-30

A lot of Democrats just want to keep the story going so they have to feed the media beast every so often on the Russia story which goes nowhere.  But who has motive here? I would argue that Comey could have motive, or someone close to Comey could have motive to release this, saying, look, I was a crusader for the truth. I wanted to get this information out before the voters went to the polls. Or, Sean, it could be someone high up in the Obama administration who was out at that meeting, Kerry or Loretta Lynch, who wants to burnish their reputation as someone who, look, we didn't want to influence the election with this. Look we were being very judicious in not putting out this information until October. We wanted to be very clear that everyone in the intelligence agencies were on board that Russia was actually trying to tamper with the election.  But what we know is that they are still leaking. The leaking never stops with these people. They are now releasing information about what happened with a Comey meeting with top Obama administration officials?

79,INGRAHAM," I think her initial comments are probably more accurate. It blew up in the last 24 hours. But to me it is becoming increasingly clear, and I think you agree, that there are a number of Trump transition people whose names were unmasked and released to various friends in the press. These individuals had nothing to do with the Russian investigation, zero. But they wanted to demonize these people and they wanted to, most of all, Sean, delegitimize the Trump conservative populist agenda. So they were going to delegitimize him on immigration, on tax reform, on health care by keeping this perpetual cloud over him, by his staff looking for information, that I think had nothing to do with Russia, to try to besmirch the reputation perhaps of staffers in the transition.  And I think when Devin Nunes and the Democrats cop up this information finally, I think we are going to have a very different view about all of this.

Joining us now with reaction, former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer and former Obama economic guru, adviser, Austan Goolsbee is with us.

118,HANNITY," And that if in the act of intelligence gathering, legitimate intelligence gatherings, that Americans are picked up, we should use the process known as minimization and we certainly shouldn't unmask their identity and we certainly shouldn't leak the intelligence which is a violation of the Espionage Act and a felony, do you agree with that?

120,HANNITY," OK, so, Ari Fleischer, what are we learning here from John Solomon and James Rosen and Sara Carter and even Evelyn Farkas that in fact surveillance took place, unveiling took place, a felony was committed in the case of General Flynn, and they're talking about releasing intelligence for political purposes on NBC. What is your reaction to that? ",4,347.0,60.0,host,95.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-30
121,"ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY"," Sean, I will tell you what I am learning. Any factor, any development on this issue that has the remote possibility of supporting Donald Trump's point of view is illegitimately gathered, illegitimately disseminated, and it should never be shared. On the other side, any fact or development that opposes what Donald Trump is saying is properly gathered, ought to be disseminated by everybody, and the Democrats who do it should be praised.  This is the coverage of this issue. There are two sides to it, but the only side that gets hammered is anything supports what Donald Trump possibly has said, and I say that, Sean, as somebody who opposes President Trump's first tweets because he went too far when he blamed this on Barack Obama. But the process ever since then has been a lopsided, one-sided, unfair process. ",4,817.0,142.0,guest,96.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-30
122,HANNITY," But Donald Trump was surveilled. We believe a FISA warrant, there was surveillance before the election, and certainly Devin Nunes was saying in November, December, and January, surveillance took place, that leaks took place, unmasking took place, and we are talking about now there is no privacy for the American people. So my question I guess -- ",4,348.0,59.0,host,97.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-03-30

136,FLEISCHER," No, that is exactly right. And it's just such a leap of faith to say that the Trump people colluded with the Russians to do this, but that's what everybody wants to believe at least in the media and among the Democrats, where it's totally legitimate for them to say these anti-Trump things. Look, Sean, at the news conference yesterday with the two Senate leaders of the intelligence committee, the Republican senator was asked because of his relationship to Donald Trump can he be a fair investigator since he was for Donald Trump? Nobody said to the lead Democrat from the press, nobody asked because you are against Donald Trump, can you be fair?  This whole media approach to this is so lopsided, suggesting only one side could be wrong, and that is Donald Trump's side. I want to have an investigation, but I have so little faith that the press is going to be the one who has any sense of fairness as they cover this issue.

138,FLEISCHER," No. Nobody has seen any evidence. In fact The New York Times who broke some of the stories about this has reported itself no evidence of collusion. But that's what an investigation is, and I do think with the Russians did in getting involved in that election was nefarious in and of itself. And that ought to be investigated.

0,"SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST"," And welcome to this busy Friday news night here on ""Hannity."" Now, in just a few minutes, we'll have Newt Gingrich, Kellyanne Conway, Jay Sekulow, Monica Crowley. They'll all join us. But first -- for the good of the country, it is time to end this GOP circular firing squad, and that is tonight's ""Opening Monologue."" All right, so sometimes in life, when things don't go exactly the way we want, people get frustrated, they get annoyed, and there's no more frustrating place on earth than Washington, D.C. So I get why the president is upset that Republicans couldn't hammer out this deal on health care last week. Now, the president, to his credit -- he has a big, bold, aggressive agenda. See that list there? He's checking off his promises one after another. I say he's moving at the speed of Trump. Now, we have promised on this program to hold Washington accountable, and that means everybody. Now, while it's understandable the president is frustrated over the GOP health care bill and it being pulled -- I'm, too, but I see it a little bit differently than he does. From my perspective, after seven years, almost eight years of Republicans promising to repeal and replace ObamaCare, to me, it is inexcusable they didn't build a consensus bill that was ready for the president. Now, the other big mistake is the Republican leadership -- they kept everybody in the dark! Everyone was left guessing what's in the bill, what's in the bill? All these rumors were coming out. Oh, this is in it, that's trouble. That's in it, there's trouble. There was no consensus that was built behind the scenes! Now, the Republican leadership -- they dumped this bill. They literally rolled it out and then left it to the president to close the deal. Well, guess what? That's not his job. Now, the president does deserve credit. He did his best to get it done, got very close, but they didn't get there. The legislative branch, though, from my perspective -- they failed the president because they clearly were not prepared for this moment. Now, in the end, I do believe it is important to get the bill right, rather than get it done fast. Now, some in Washington -- they're trying to put all the blame on the conservative Freedom Caucus. And as I said last night, I think this anger is misplaced. Now, if the Freedom Caucus had been consulted from the beginning and they didn't roll out the bill and they had a chance to see it beforehand and leadership reached out to them from the get-go, I don't think we'd be in this situation. Now, sometimes, we need to stand back and remember who our real friends are. Let me give you an example. Let's talk about Illinois Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger. Now, today, writes an op-ed for The New York Times titled, quote, ""How the Freedom Caucus is undermining the GOP"" where he literally mocks the Freedom Caucus, literally, and their name by writing, quote, ""Interesting name for a group of about three dozen members that refuses to let the will of the people advance on the House floor."" Now, keep in mind, this is the same Adam Kinzinger who during the election and prior to the inauguration was mentioned in headlines, like the one you see on your screen, the same Adam who in August said he wouldn't vote for Donald Trump. Watch this.",1,3278.0,582.0,host,1.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01

2,"REP. ADAM KINZINGER, R-ILLINOIS"," Donald Trump for me is beginning to cross a lot of red lines of the unforgivable in politics. And so, you know, I'm not going to support Hillary, but you know, in America, we have the right to write somebody in or skip the vote and vote for Mark Kirk in Illinois, for instance, and that's what it's looking like for me today. I just don't see how I get to Donald Trump anymore.",1,378.0,75.0,guest,2.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01
3,,(END VIDEO CLIP),1,,,,,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01
4,HANNITY," And even following the election, Kinzinger played coy about who he actually voted for on November the 8th. Now, is Congressman Kinzinger -- is he really the guy to be lecturing the Freedom Caucus, who did support candidate Trump? I'm not buying that. Now, during the campaign, the Freedom Caucus chairman, Mark Meadows -- he was a staunch ally of candidate Trump, now President Trump. In July, in Greenville on line, they ran an article on Meadows that said in part, quote, ""Meadows initially endorsed Texas senator Ted Cruz in the Republican presidential primary, but he is now embracing Trump with more gusto than others in the GOP. And according to Nate Silver's Fivethirtyeight, at least 29 of the 34 members of the House Freedom Caucus endorsed or at least voted for Trump in the election. And by the way, with all due respect to Speaker Ryan, Laura Ingraham last night on this program pointed out Ryan made it clear he wanted little to do with then candidate Donald Trump. So let's be clear. A lot of blame to throw around about the Republican health care bill being pulled, and infighting is not a solution to the problem. I also don't think President Trump reaching out to Democrats is ever going to work. The one thing I do know for sure, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Steny Hoyer -- they're not the president's friends and they do not want him to succeed in any way.  Don't believe me? Listen to what they said about the president.",1,1441.0,257.0,host,3.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01

10,HANNITY," All right, now the question is, where do we go from here? How do we solve the problem for the American people because this is a promise they made. Now, Republicans, in many ways -- need to go back to the drawing board and do what they should have done in the first place.  They need to create a bill that will pass in the House, and that means the Study Group, the Tuesday Group, the Freedom Caucus, moderates. They all need to be brought in a room, as well as senators, Secretary Price, the vice president, everybody included, and hammer out a deal. Get away from the cameras, and certainly don't go on television and negotiate in the public eye. Now, if they do these things instead of pointing fingers at each other, then they'll have an opportunity to give the American people a bill that they really want, need and desire, one that's going to lower premiums and offer better health care. There's the answer. Solve the problem. Remember the movie ""Disclosure""? You talk about solve the problem. Find the solution. Here with reaction, the author of the best-seller ""Treason,"" former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. Mr. Speaker, really, does the Freedom Caucus need to get lectured?

13,GINGRICH," Look, first of all, you hit it right on the head. The Freedom Caucus had probably the highest percentage of Trump supporters of any group in the House. They disagree about this one thing, and I think, from their perspective, they probably think Trump was misinformed. But this -- let me give you an example of something today that Nancy Pelosi doesn't get. The National Association of Manufacturers met with the president to share with him that their CEOs have the highest level of confidence in making new investments in the United States that they can remember in well over a decade. This follows other things that are going on. Despite all the noise in Congress, President Trump is making real progress and he's getting things done. And every time you turn around, you see new signs of investment, new commitments to build things in the United States. I think that he's got to solve this legislative problem. My personal advice would be to start with infrastructure. And frankly, after the extraordinary fire in Atlanta last night, which is going to cause enormous traffic problems--",1,1087.0,186.0,guest,9.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01

17,GINGRICH," It's a good reminder -- an area you know well from the years you were down there. I mean, this is a good reminder we got to rebuild our infrastructure. I think you start there, then you move to a nice tax cut bill, not just tax reform. And then you get to health care third. But right now, I think they're all gridlocked and too busy being mad at each other. They've got to get over it, relax. This is the beginning of a long game. This is not the end of it. And we got lots of time to get lots of good things done for America.",1,528.0,110.0,guest,13.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01
18,HANNITY," Well, and by the way, they've got to keep the promise. This is not optional. They can't let ObamaCare implode. So to me, it's very simple. You have to, if you're in leadership, show your members the bill before you unveil the bill publicly.  Then you got to build consensus. I appreciate that there are moderates and different groups, Study Group, Tuesday Group, Freedom Caucus. You got to -- everyone's got to work together. They got to hammer out a consensus. It would be wise for them to work with the Senate from the get-go so they don't end up in conference and the Senate bill and the House bill are two very different bills, and that then becomes another opportunity for it to fall apart. So bring everybody together. And while they're doing the things you mention, this can get done, right?",1,799.0,145.0,host,14.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01
19,GINGRICH," Yes, I think it can get done. I also think, if they do it right, they're going to shock all of us because if you look at the collapse of ObamaCare in rural America, I think Senator Heitkamp, who's a Democrat from North Dakota, might have a really hard time voting against a good Republican bill that was well designed. I think the same thing goes for the senator from Indiana, the senator from Missouri, the senator from Montana. I wouldn't automatically assume that they're going to going to hunker down and decide to destroy themselves. They're up for reelection next year. And in parts of rural America, ObamaCare is a total disaster, and we can do something dramatically better. And if the public understands it -- which is the other half of this -- the country has to believe in the bill if it's going to pass. Health is too big an issue to pass if the American people aren't with you.",1,891.0,164.0,guest,15.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01
20,HANNITY," But there is something to learn from this experience. I think, number one, you can't unveil a bill that nobody's seen. You have to bring the different groups in the Congress together. You should include the Senate so you don't have a problem in conference. And why would they have done it this way anyway? That makes no sense to me.

Or as somebody once said to me, you know, you got one mouth and two ears and there's a pretty good hint there. And I think the fact is that people -- when you're doing something this big, one fifth of the economy, life and death for every American, you need to do it carefully out in the open. People have to have a real sense of participation. You can't ram it through, and you can't assume that a small group of people know enough by themselves. That's what Obama did wrong. That's what Hillary did wrong back in the `90s. This is a really big, complicated issue. I think it's fixable, but-- and it may take three or four bills, all of which ought to be understood from day one.  And I think that -- frankly, that's part of why I would shift and look at infrastructure and at tax cuts because you can do those while you're working through what needs to be done in health care. All three could be done this year if they're willing to work with the American people and have an open legislative process.",1,1113.0,216.0,guest,20.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01

37,HANNITY," You get this? The mainstream alt left propaganda destroy Trump media -- they're trying to distract the country by going after Nunes and questioning his credibility. Now, by doing that, they are ignoring the real story and what we should all be talking about because what Nunes has revealed about the leaks, the unmasking of American names, and of course, the surveillance of the Trump team -- this could end up being the biggest scandal in decades, if not ever, to hit Washington! Now, the big question is this. Did the Obama administration knowingly supreme court the Trump team and incoming opposition party? Now, as Nunes said on this program last week, additional American names were unmasked, and he saw the reports and he said they had nothing to do with Russia and collusion! And this should concern every single lawmaker, every single journalist and every American. And today, Fox's own Adam Housley is reporting that the two individuals who showed Nunes the information at the White House -- they had nothing to do with the outing of this information!

We're also told the people who helped Devin Nunes navigate were the two individuals that the stories were reported yesterday about, but they were not his sources. It was a navigation situation. And the reason why they had to navigate, I'm told, is that Nunes learned about this unmasking and who this was taking place back in January, before Trump's tweet, before he met with the president. And it took, obviously, a number of weeks to try to figure out a way for him to see this intelligence because the agencies were stonewalling, we're told, to allow him and others to see it.

Here with reaction, the chairman for the American Center for Law and Justice Jay Sekulow, Fox News contributor Mercedes Schlapp. All right, is there anything wrong -- because Pete Hoekstra said this was standard operating procedure. If you're going to see raw intelligence like this, Jay, that it would be normal procedures to see it in an area that we know is safe and secure and that that's what he did all the time.

42,"JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE"," Well, I mean, here's the-- the fact is, there is a statute, two statutes, actually, that deal particularly with this. There's a procedure in place that allows the chairman and others in the intelligence community and the Intelligence Committee to view this data, and it specifically says it shall not be an offense to transmit information described in this section, which is the section involving this kind of material, to either congressional Intelligence Committee. And then that's section 31-22. 31-25 says nothing in this title may be construed as authority to withhold information from the Congress or from a committee of either house of Congress. So there's actually legislation that positively affirms the ability of these committee chairmen and others within the committee to actually get this material (INAUDIBLE) procedures, and of course, the procedures are to protect the intelligence.  So there is -- this is rather unremarkable, what took place here. And I think the media -- as you said, this is a distraction, but the law is crystal clear here.

80,HANNITY," And welcome back to ""Hannity."" So this morning, the president took to Twitter to defend former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and the president tweeted, quote, ""Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt, excuse the big election loss by the media and Dems of historic proportion."" Now, this comes after reports say that Flynn is willing to testify in front of the House and Senate Intel Committees in exchange for immunity. Joining is now with reaction, conservative commentator Monica Crowley, and we continue with Jay Sekulow from a legal perspective. Monica, you were there with General Flynn. What happened to him I don't think there's any doubt was leaking this intelligence was a violation of the Espionage Act and a felony, many other laws were broken, we will ask Jay in a second. But I agree. I think General Flynn wants to say what he has to say because he has a victim of a crime here. ",3,929.0,165.0,host,64.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01
81,"MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," General Flynn, Sean, is now a private citizen. So he is perfectly entitled to seek whatever protections he can going forward. And look, I think the reality is none of us know the backstory here. If General Flynn has already been solicited by investigators, then this request for immunity makes perfect sense. If he hasn't yet been approached by investigators, then perhaps he is trying to accelerate the timeline somehow.  And look, since we know none of the backstory and none of the details here, perhaps none of this has to do with Russia at all. Maybe there are some other things at play here. But the bottom line is that General Flynn is entitled to these protections.  And I also think he has the Watergate story in mind here. Remember that Richard Nixon during the Watergate process was alleged to have been captured on tape merely suggesting the possibility of asking the CIA to interview with the FBI to stop the Watergate investigation. That served as one of the bases for article one of the Watergate impeachment. That's essentially a thought crime. General Flynn does not want to be prosecuted or persecuted for anything, least of all something he may or may not have said or done. ",3,1195.0,212.0,guest,65.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01
82,HANNITY," Jay, from my standpoint, they leaked this intelligence they never should have leaked. They are surveilling. The NSA does its job. They are surveilling his counterpart in Russia. They're having a conversation. It's a normal procedure. He's getting in touch with people he will have contact with and will be working with. So they're supposed to minimize and they're not supposed to reveal their identity. His identity is unmasked. The contents of their conversation are made public, and then he tells a story to the vice president, maybe left detail or to go, perhaps by accident, maybe on purpose, I don't know. And his career is over because they leaked this intelligence. A felony, right? ",3,691.0,117.0,host,66.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01
83,"JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE"," Right. So in that scenario you just laid out, this is exactly why General Flynn's lawyers are asking them to seek immunity because, as Monica just said, this is a bit of a witch hunt here in this sense -- who is the victim of really what happened here. General Flynn, the president saying this is right. He is the victim. He was unmasked, so no minimization. It was leaked, so you're talking about felonies and civil actions now. And it was leaked to the press and published, and now he is the one made to look to be the evildoer, so to speak, yet we don't even know the backstory of any of this. But we do know two things. He was unmasked and it was a leak. And that leaking is a felony, period. ",3,698.0,138.0,guest,67.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01
84,HANNITY," Doesn't every American need to understand that if your government is going to surveil your texts, your emails, your phone conversations, and they don't have any warrant, and then they disclose that, they could ruin anybody's life, especially yours or Monica's. ",3,262.0,43.0,host,68.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01
85,SEKULOW," I will tell you this. Look, here is the reality. Republican, Democrat, independent, libertarian, I don't care what party you are, the idea that this information was gathered, and it was unmasked and then leaked, this is leaking of intelligence about an individual American, an American citizen. Why are we saying that is OK? We should not be. That should be investigated as a crime because that is what it is. ",3,411.0,73.0,guest,69.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01
86,HANNITY, Agreed. That's a one crime we know Monica that happened here. Go ahead. ,3,73.0,15.0,host,70.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01
87,CROWLEY," Yes. And I invoked the Watergate example for a reason earlier, Sean, and that's because I spent four years working with former President Nixon during the last four years of his life. And I know a bit about presidential wiretapping. Devin Nunes, all of these peripheral conversations have nothing to do with the actual possible scandal here, which is that the Obama team, the folks who were still in the White House under President Obama may have in fact unmasked people, surveilled political opponents, and then weaponized classified material against their political opponents. If that is true, that makes Watergate look like child's play. ",3,641.0,106.0,guest,71.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01
88,HANNITY," That's what I was going to say. Doesn't this have the potential to be way bigger than Watergate, Jay? ",3,103.0,21.0,host,72.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01
89,SEKULOW," This is national security information that is being leaked here. So the seriousness of this is at the highest level. When you look at what is the potential damage to the United States or intelligence gathering capabilities into those that are working within the government, this is the worst-case scenario of what can happen, and it happened.  And here is the fact. If you're looking at where the grand jury should be empaneled, it's fine to get testimony from General Flynn and have him appear before the committee and he should seek immunity and he should get it and he should tell it and lay laid out for the community, and that's great, but the crime here is the leakers.

112,CONWAY," It's just be good if people got the message. I think actually thing when you look at some of these confidence numbers, it does show that people and job creators, the jobseekers and the job holders, Sean, all our seeing very good in his presidency so far. So if you look at that National Association of Manufacturers survey today, it's the highest it's been in 20 years. The man has been on the job for less than three months. It is a 93.3 percent confidence measure. One year ago it was 56.6 percent. That's not a margin of error. That's not tinkering. That is a huge uptick in confidence. You saw recently the homebuilders' confidence survey, highest in 12 years. The small business confidence survey in Gallop, highest in almost 10 years. And it just goes on and on.

117,CONWAY," Any one of these achievements would be historic. So if you think about just getting two or three even in the first year, that's huge.  And we know that health care reform will happen. We know that the president and every single Republican House and Senate who are there campaigned successfully on repealing and replacing Obamacare. So the question is what are the next steps? You're absolutely right. The conference needs to come together. But you know what I learned through this entire process? Sean, I'm old enough to have worked against HillaryCare and ObamaCare. So I've been in health care for long time. What I learned from this particular process is that this is the price of success. This is a very diverse Republican conference. You have 23 Republican members who sit in districts that Hillary Clinton won. That's a pretty big thing. And so you have everybody from like a plus Republican 25 or 30 district if you will to a plus D single digit district. So bringing together those diverse ideological and geographic viewpoints, it's very important. People have to be brought to the table earlier, but I have to say on this one the president showed a great deal of leadership. He worked the phones. ",4,1208.0,212.0,guest,95.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01
118,HANNITY," But they dumped a bill that had no consensus on his lap. Why did he have to do the heavy lifting when, in all fairness, the legislative branch had eight years to campaign, run on this, they got to the House in 2010, 2014 the Senate, 2016. Really, they didn't have a bill ready to go? That kind of makes me mad. ",4,312.0,64.0,host,96.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-01
119,CONWAY," I'm confident that the conference will come together and that the deficit in votes was in the dozens. We started out in a deficit of dozens and dozens. And it got shrunk down to about 12 to 18 votes perhaps. So that's very heartening. But look, there were moderates not supporting it. There were conservatives not supporting it. But that's the price of success for having a very diverse party. Look at the Democratic Party. Where are the prolife Democrats, the blue dog Democrats, the pro-Second Amendment Democrats? They don't exist anymore. That party is much more myopic now. They've been pulled to the left by some of their factions.  But in the case of the president, some people would prefer him to be the closer on this and not the leadoff batter. Some people appreciated the fact that he and the vice president, Secretary Price, Director Mulvaney and others leaned in from the beginning and were very involved.

0,"SEAN HANNITY, HOST"," And welcome to this busy news night tonight on ""Hannity."" In just a few minutes, Sara Carter with Circa News, Senator Ted Cruz, Sheriff David Clarke, Larry Elder, Geraldo Rivera, Michael Cohen -- they'll join us. But first, today multiple damning new reports reveal that former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice was the person who requested that the names of the Trump transition team members who were caught up in surveillance be unmasked. She has a lot of explaining to do. And that's tonight's very important ""Opening Monologue."" All right, for weeks right here on this program, we have been demanding answers about who knew what and when about the surveillance of President Trump, candidate Trump, and of course, members of his transition team. Also tonight, we appear to have a very important key piece of this very complex puzzle. Now, Fox's own Adam Housley, he's going to join us in a few minutes for the full report. He is revealing that, quote, ""the unmasked names of people associated with Donald Trump were then sent to all of those at the National Security Council and some at the Defense Department, then director of National Intelligence James Clapper and then CIA Director John Brennan -- essentially the officials at the top, including former Rice deputy Ben Rhodes."" Now, this proves the surveillance was widespread and it was known by a lot of people. And there's more. Intel sources now tell Sara Carter with Circa News, who will also join us tonight, that the unmasking of names connected with the Trump team, quote, ""appeared to begin last July around the time that Trump secured the GOP nomination and accelerated after Trump's election in November, launched a transition that continued through January."" Now, Circa News is also reporting that most, if not all, had nothing to do with Russia. And that's not all tonight. Eli Lake with Bloomberg View, who will also join us tonight, reported today, quote, ""One U.S. official familiar with the reports said they contained valuable political information on the Trump transition team, such as whom the Trump team was meeting, the views of Trump associates on foreign policy matters and plans for the incoming administration."" And just two weeks ago, Susan Rice, she was specifically asked during an interview on PBS if she knew about members of the Trump team being caught up in, quote, ""incidental surveillance."" She says no. Watch this.",1,2417.0,405.0,host,1.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-03

5,HANNITY," Oh, really? I know nothing about that? Well, that's what you just heard her say. Was she lying in that clip? Well, new reports today indicate yes, yes, she was.  Now, keep in mind this new information about Susan Rice comes on the heels of the smoking gun tape that was uncovered last week that we played on the program of former Obama official Dr. Evelyn Farkas admitting not only surveillance took place but the names were also unmasked and they wanted them leaked! Now, tonight, we are demanding answers to these questions. The American people, you now have a right to know. For example, what justification did Susan Rice have to unmask these names? That's pretty unprecedented. What did Ben Rhodes know? What did the former director of National Intelligence James Clapper know? What did the former CIA Director John Brennan know?  Was this done for pure political purposes under the ruse of national security? And more importantly, what did then-President Obama know and when did he know it? Did President Obama and members of his administration, did they knowingly surveil an opposition party or an incoming president? America deserves answers tonight. Now, before we get to that, we bring in Adam Housley with the very latest on his explosive new report. Adam, this is a huge deal and a big development. Let's talk about it.",1,1331.0,230.0,host,4.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-03
6,"ADAM HOUSLEY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT"," Yes, Sean, we started researching this, you know, last week when we started getting some of our sources talking to (ph). As you mentioned, Eli Lake -- I know he's on your show later -- he was the first one that came out to actually say it was Susan Rice. We had a belief it was Susan Rice also, but of course, we had so much information coming in, you got to make sure we get it get it right first, which we did.  So we can say that multiple sources tell FOX News that the former national security adviser under President Obama, Susan Rice, requested to unmask the names of Trump transition officials. The unmasked names are people associated with Donald Trump, were all then sent, as you mentioned, to the NSC, some at DOD, James Clapper, John Brennan, basically all the people at the top, including former deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes.  Now, these names, we're told, were in (ph) part of incidental electronic surveillance and -- of candidate Trump, President-elect Donald Trump, as well, and people close to him, including his family members, some of them, as well, for up to a year, we're told, before he took office.  Now, when names of Americans are incidentally collected, for those at home who don't know, they're supposed to be masked, meaning the names are redacted from reports, where it's international or domestic collection, unless it's an issue of national security or crime or if their security is threatened in any way. But there are loopholes and ways to unmask through some back channels, but Americans are supposed be protected from incidental collection. Our sources say in this case, they were not. And this all comes in the wake of Evelyn Farkas's television interview that you mentioned last month. The former deputy assistant secretary of defense under Obama said this in part.",1,1818.0,318.0,guest,5.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-03

10,HOUSLEY," Meantime, we're also told that House Intelligence chairman Devin Nunes knew about the unmasking and leaking back in January, well before President Trump's tweet in March alleging wiretapping. Our sources say, quote, ""The intelligence agencies slow-rolled Nunes."" He could have seen the logs in other places besides the White House SCIF, which is the secure room where he and other chairmen have looked at this stuff in the past, but it had already been weeks and he hadn't been able to get the information, so he went to the White House because he could protect his sources and he could also get those logs. So it was twofold.  Also keep in mind, as the Obama administration left office, it approved new rules which gave the NSA much broader powers by relaxing rules about sharing intercepted personal communications and the ability to share those with 16 other U.S. intelligence agencies. And Sean, I should also mention that Susan Rice -- I know you've covered this, as well, as we did, in regards to Benghazi, but she was the one that went on these Sunday shows claiming it was a video, and now we know all along, we know that attack had nothing to do with a video, Sean.",1,1175.0,209.0,guest,7.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-03
11,HANNITY," All right, Adam, great reporting. We really appreciate it. We're going to stay on it. Joining us now with more from Bloomberg View, Eli Lake, from CircaNews.com, Sara Carter. Eli, let's start with you. Welcome to the program. All right, so incidental surveillance -- this is what Devin Nunes was talking about, OK, but what bothered him. Now we find out Susan Rice seemingly is purposely unmasking the names of people, but only Trump transition team's member (sic) or maybe even then candidate Trump -- what those conversations were, if they were picked up, quote, ""incidentally."" Why is that dangerous? And why should the American people understand the seriousness of this?",1,675.0,112.0,host,8.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-03
12,"ELI LAKE, BLOOMBERG VIEW"," Well, I want to just stress that I don't know other things that she requested to be unmasked. But the way I understand is this is that the National Security Council staffer who was brought in for Trump who was doing a review of the unmasking policy noticed an anomaly in the patterns of requests from Susan Rice to unmask the names that were incidentally collected in summaries of basically raw intelligence, of monitored communications. That was then discovered by the staffer, whose name has been out there. He then takes that to the general counsel's office in the White House, who then looks into this some more and have tried to make this available to first Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, but also Adam Schiff, the ranking member of that committee. And they've also offered this to the Senate Intelligence Committee.",1,854.0,147.0,guest,9.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-03
13,HANNITY," All right, and Sara, so why would Susan Rice, especially as it relates to everything that we have been talking about, take incidental surveillance and ask -- this is raw intelligence -- ask for the unmasking, but only seemingly in the case of the Trump transition team or perhaps even Trump as a candidate?  How dangerous is that when the White House, an administration, a sitting administration, is surveilling and using legitimate surveillance to basically surveill on an opposition party?",1,492.0,82.0,host,10.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-03

Section 702 of the 12-333 executive order is supposed to protect Americans from being unmasked. But if we go back to the stories that we wrote last week, in 2011, that was expanded. The FISA court signed off under the Obama administration to allow for more leniency in unmasking. So it wasn't like -- it's almost like as if it was legalized without us knowing it. And so the unmasking was allowed to occur. So in 2011, then in 2015, they relaxed the laws even more. So what they were able to do is, and we know -- we know it went to Susan Rice.

You're are correct that on Benghazi, she gave a story about the internet video.  But I would just kind of go back and I'd say that we're I think at the beginning of this investigation, and what we may end up finding out is that the law that allows the U.S. government to collect all this information and share it within the government needs to seriously be reformed because it may turn out that all of what Susan Rice did was technically legal, but improper, if you will. And in that case, I think it would be a matter of reform.  And I would just say this. I'm surprised that more Democrats and progressives have not taken this issue more seriously because if Barack Obama can do this to the Trump transition, then surely Donald Trump can do this to his own opposition, and that's something that ought to worry all Americans.",2,992.0,188.0,guest,36.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-03

Now, this could lead to very bitter and unprecedented confirmation showdown. And that's tonight's mini-monologue. All right, way back in 2013, when Democrats had control of the Senate and President Obama was in the White House, well, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, well, he changed long-standing Senate precedents and eliminated the 60-vote threshold that is needed for the confirmation of Obama nominees.  And for three years after that, many Senate Democrats argued that this precedent of an up or down vote should be applied to all appointments, including Obama's Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland.

They didn't land a punch. Now Senate Democrats are vowing to use, well, the last option of obstruction that's available, the filibuster. Now, currently, only four Democrats are promising to oppose the filibuster, and that means that such a filibuster is highly possible and Republicans will be left with one option, to invoke the nuclear option or the constitutional option and extend Harry Reid's 50-vote threshold for the first time ever to a Supreme Court nominee.

We're going to have an up and down vote on Judge Gorsuch, and this week, Judge Gorsuch he will be confirmed as the next associate justice of the Supreme Court. And you know, that really is a victory for the American people. This last election, as you know, was in many ways a referendum on what sort of justice would replace Justice Antonin Scalia.

For six years Republicans have been promising the American people, if you elect us we will get this done. And I think we have got to get the job done.  It took Obama 14 months to pass ObamaCare. The House bill was on the floor just 18 days. And 18 days was not long enough. And we can get this done in a way that actually fixes the problem. If you look at the members on both sides within the party, I'm spending virtually every moment night and day meeting with House members, meeting with senators, meeting with the administration trying to get people to yes. And people want to get to yes. Conservatives want to get yes, moderates want to get to yes, and we can get this done.  And Sean, I'll tell you, the central test for success is going to be whether we drive down the cost of premiums. We need to make health insurance more affordable so people can afford to get care for their families. If we do that, we will have succeeded. If we don't, we will have failed.

81,CRUZ," I think that's exactly right. And the players want to get to yes. If we set our goal, how do you lower health insurance premiums? There are a lot of tools, and we know what those tools are. The most important is addressing the ObamaCare insurance mandates. Under ObamaCare there are a dozen mandates that are the prime drivers for premiums skyrocketing.  House bill just repealed two of those 12. It left 10 of the 12 ObamaCare mandates in place. That doesn't make any sense because it makes health care unaffordable. There are other tools we have, things like enabling people to purchase across state lines, things like association health plans. ",3,648.0,114.0,guest,67.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-03

We're meeting frequently, and I'm doing everything I can to help lead the fight for President Trump and all of us in Congress to deliver on the promises we made to the American people.  We have a historic opportunity. I think in 2017 we are poised to do for big things -- to repeal ObamaCare, to past fundamental tax reform, to see major regulatory reform, and to confirm a strong conservative to the Supreme Court. If we do those four, 2017 is a blockbuster year. And so I'm spending my time rolling up my sleeves, trying to get the job done. You're right, in the last two weeks President Trump signed two bills I authored, one the NASA authorization bill which puts our space program on a strong and growing platform going forward, and then number two, a bill that enable states to require drug testing for unemployment benefits.

Now, tonight, we'll expose the Obama administration's sabotage, and that is tonight's very important ""Opening Monologue."" All right, we want to take you through this step by step because it's a huge scandal. Now, it started last month. Remember President Trump, he sent out a tweet accusing the Obama administration of surveilling him during the election. Now, since then, we've been peeling away all the layers of the president's claim with the help of the investigative reporting from people like Sara Carter and John Solomon. Now, first, Sara and John uncovered the existence of an FBI investigation into a server being utilized at Trump Tower. They also discovered that a FISA warrant that allowed federal officials to capture Trump team communications existed prior to the president taking office. Then they revealed that high-ranking officials with direct access to President Obama may have had access to unmasked federal surveillance of Trump transition team members! This is all very important. And they may have briefed the president about this information. Then on March 22nd, House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, he revealed that he had seen reports that prove that President Trump and members of his transition team were, in fact, unmasked and that the intel had nothing to do with Russia! Now, last week, we also uncovered video from March 2nd. Dr. Evelyn Farkas, very prominent Obama administration official, served in the administration only until 2015, encouraging her former colleagues and people on the Hill, get as much intelligence as they can about the Trump team before they leave office.

So it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy, that the Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about their -- the staff -- the Trump staff dealing with Russians, that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we would no longer have access to that intelligence. So I became very worried because not enough was coming out into the open, and I knew that there was more. We have very good intelligence on Russia.

Joining us now, from the American Center for Law and Justice, Jay Sekulow, the host of ""Justice with Judge Jeanine Pirro,"" and of course, the host of the brand-new show ""You Are the Jury"" on FOX, Judge Jeanine Pirro. All right, so I'm trying to lay the history out here. Give me any scenario under which Susan Rice, national security adviser, would specifically request raw intelligence unmasking -- let's say the intelligence was legitimate against Russia, China, Iran, doesn't matter. OK, but Americans incidentally are caught up in a call. There's no warrant to listen to them. It's supposed to be minimized. And their names are never supposed to be revealed.",1,1263.0,210.0,host,27.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04

She would pass a lie detector test. She's told so many stories, she couldn't -- she can't tell one from another! But here's the most significant aspect of this. What she said to Andrea Mitchell was not a denial of the unmasking, you noticed.",1,355.0,65.0,guest,40.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04

58,SEKULOW," Number two -- so then you look at what laws are being implicated here. And there are multiple felony counts. But let me give you one simple one. I mean, if she put this in motion -- and this is what everybody needs to understand. But for Susan Rice unmasking this -- if she didn't do this, none of this would have happened. She did it. She put this whole issue in play. If she was working with others, knowing that they were going to distribute it, wink and a nod or however she did it, that's a conspiracy under the espionage statutes. So it's very, very serious. And I'll tell you something.

63,SEKULOW," Well, of course it -- look at the -- look, we -- we -- Judge knows this. She's a judge. I've tried a lot of cases for over 37 years. You look at the timeline here. As the intelligence increased against the president and his associates, what starts to happen? It becomes more frequent. So this wasn't an incidental accident. Oh, my goodness, I want to know who USA 1 is, U.S. person 1. And it's President Trump or President-elect Trump at that point, or one of his associates. But then she wants more. And then as it gets closer, it's more. So here's the political question. Why are we saying it's OK to be spying on -- and I don't want to even call it surveillance anymore, spying on the president-elect of the United States? Why is that OK?",1,742.0,141.0,guest,48.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
64,PIRRO," Well, it's certainly not OK. And you've got the making of a false statement. You've got espionage. You've got violations of the FISA Act. But I think what's significant here is the fact that if Obama knew about all this, nobody seems to care. And this goes right to the timeline until it looked like, Oh, my God, they're taking him seriously. And now what we need to do is -- we got to stop. We got to get the dirt. We got to pass it around.

111,HANNITY," All right, as we continue with Laura Ingraham -- here's, in my mind, where this is going, that we have incidental intelligence supposedly, but really, they were using national security as a ruse to really get to Trump surveillance, in other words, that there was an orchestrated effort to surveil candidate Trump and President-elect Trump and his transition team and unmask them, and in the case of General Flynn, leak the intelligence. Is there any other plausible theory, hypothesis you have short of that?",3,509.0,85.0,host,91.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
112,INGRAHAM," The veneer of incidental coverage here seems really flimsy. Again, the sources I talked to say that doesn't matter. They say it was incidental, it makes it sound like it was nothing. You still have to go through the normal protocols in order to unmask these individuals. You can't do it in pick and choose and try to troll the raw data and the raw files for any morsel you think might implicate Trump or any associates in the future. Again, when you are an outgoing administration after a really tough election battle and the partisanship and the rancor and animosity was as high as it was from the Obamas to Trump and vice versa, and with Susan Rice's old history on Benghazi, the fact that she wasn't going to get confirmed, she wanted to be secretary of state. She was never going to be confirmed. That's why they put her at the National Security Council. All of this adds up to a very murky scenario. We just need to know more. We need to know more information. I don't think it stops at Susan Rice. I think focusing on Rice may be the wrong pathway here.",3,1060.0,198.0,guest,92.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
113,HANNITY," But standard operating procedure according to every single intel source I have would require that if it was incidental that minimization occur, that they don't reveal the name of the American. They don't unmask the American. And certainly you don't leak the name, leak the intelligence, which, by the way, is raw intelligence, otherwise you are violating any sense of privacy. And you used the term very early on. That would make America a policed state. Correct?",3,464.0,78.0,host,93.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
114,INGRAHAM," Yes. That's a felony. And there is a written record. No one from the I.C. community, the intelligence community, would ever do the unmasking and give that information on a verbal order. It just doesn't happen. There have to be written protocols that are followed. Those written protocols have to be there. They have to be there somewhere whether in a ledger or some other log. And claiming executive privilege here would indicate to me that the president actually spoke to Susan Rice.

130,HANNITY," She probably talked to Rice's mom. Anyway, how else do you get that report? Here with reaction, the author of the upcoming book ""The Smear, How Shady Political Operatives and Fake News Control What You See, What You Think, and How You Vote,"" Sharyl Attkisson, and former spokesman for the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Ric Grenell is with us. All right, Sharyl, so for eight months the news media, the same people that we know colluded with the Clinton campaign during the election, the same people that never vetted Obama, they have been running wild with a Russia, Trump campaign conspiracy story. There's no evidence to date that I have seen. If you have seen it, share it with us. Imagine if this was Donald Trump and he's leaving office and in the process of him leaving office, Donald Trump sets in motion a way to surveil the incoming president or then candidate of the opposition party. Do you think the news media would be treating it the same as they're doing it now?",4,976.0,176.0,host,105.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
131,"SHARYL ATTKISSON, ""FULL MEASURE"" HOST"," I don't. And I agree. I haven't seen evidence of Russia collusion with the Trump campaign, and I have spoken to former top Obama intel officials who say they haven't seen evidence of that either. And I do think there's a very disparate treatment by the news media in general between the two allegations, one of which seems to have no public evidence to prove it. The other, the discussion that's happening now about Susan Rice, does seem to have at least some credible evidence that you can check out behind it and yet is being treated with some proper skepticism, but I would say in many cases over the top skepticism as if it couldn't possibly be true or that there couldn't possibly be anything wrong with it.",4,713.0,130.0,guest,106.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
132,HANNITY," Now we do know certain things at this point, Sharyl. We know that surveillance in fact did take place. Incidental, perhaps, whatever, but surveillance did take place. Now she didn't even deny in the interviews today, although two weeks ago, Susan Rice, the media seems to have amnesia. She said she didn't know anything about this. She revealed in this interview today that in fact she did know, and in fact unmasking of Trump officials did take place. But she defended it and said I didn't leak the information. Just because she says so doesn't make it true. After all, she did spread a lie about Benghazi on five separate morning showing, did she not?",4,654.0,116.0,host,107.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
133,ATTKISSON," She did give completely false information about Benghazi on numerous occasions as did the Obama administration. And I think if you look back, this is my opinion based on the evidence, you'll see a pattern that involves surveillance, whether it's whistleblowers, political opponents, journalists and other people that occurred under the Obama administration, maybe has occurred under other administrations as well. But we know factually that it occurred in an unprecedented way under the Obama administration, and I think if you put it all together on a timeline it starts to paint a picture, instead of isolated events and accusation, a pattern of behavior.",4,658.0,105.0,guest,108.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
134,HANNITY," Ric, I think Sharyl is referring to our own James Rosen. I think she's referring to what happened with Tea Party groups and the IRS. And we have an admission. Why would she specifically seek out raw intelligence of -- whether or not it was legal surveillance, incidental pickups of Trump and his transition team or his campaign, and why would she want an unmasking of those individuals for what possible reason, other than being political?",4,440.0,77.0,host,109.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
135,"RIC GRENELL, FORMER SPOKESMAN FOR U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N."," Yes. Look, the national security adviser does have the ability to request an unmasking of a name. They get intelligence and the name is redacted, you don't see it. And they begin to say, hey, I need to know who this person is in order to implement some sort of policy. The problem here, Sean, is that Susan Rice did this specifically just for Trump officials. She did it during the transition. She did it with high frequency all the way through the transition after Trump was elected. And then she widely disseminated the unmasked names. That's where I think she got caught.",4,575.0,104.0,guest,110.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
136,HANNITY, Wouldn't that be a felony at that point?,4,41.0,9.0,host,111.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
137,GRENELL," Well, she released these names to other people at the NSC and the State Department who had clearances, so that wouldn't be illegal to do that. But the only reason to unmask a name is so that you can see it and decide, hey, do I need to do something with this, implement some sort of strategy or tell someone else? To have the name unmasked and then widely disseminate it to other people inside the State Department, that is pure politics. There is no question in my mind and others in the State Department who believe that this information was widely disseminated so that it would be leaked. And as we know, someone did leak it. Susan Rice claims that she didn't leak it. But it just doesn't hold water for someone so political like Susan Rice, who's been caught too many times spinning, to widely disseminate an unmasked name. There is no reason to widely disseminate that, and she did. And the people at the State Department began to say, wait a minute, why are we getting this unmasked name? There's no reason for it.",4,1021.0,188.0,guest,112.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
138,HANNITY," To get to this raw intelligence, there is a record every time you go into a secure area. There would be a record of every single thing that she was looking for and saw. Correct?",4,178.0,36.0,host,113.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
139,GRENELL," Absolutely. When she opens up a cable, if she forwards that information, if she prints it, it's all recorded. There is a long list of that. We can tell exactly who received this information of an unmasked name. They could go back and find it. It is going to be difficult to find who leaked it, but we will know who was widely on that list and received the unmasked name. This is a political problem for her. And clearly doing it during the transition indicates that she was doing this against her political enemies. And, to me, we've got to get to the bottom of it. Rand Paul is exactly right about an investigation.",4,617.0,116.0,guest,114.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
140,HANNITY," Basically, Sharyl, I'll give you the last word, we're talking about spying on an incoming president under the guise of national intelligence. That, to me, I can't think of any possible scenario why this information would have been unmasked or revealed. I just can't, except for political purposes.",4,298.0,49.0,host,115.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
141,ATTKISSON," Intelligence officials under the Obama administration that I was in communication with alerted me a couple years ago in relation to my own computer intrusion case that they felt there was a lot of mischief going on inside intel agencies, that intelligence was being used in a way that they said it never had been before. These are people who have been there for decades, and they were extremely concerned about the patterns they saw.",4,434.0,76.0,guest,116.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04

147,RICE," You know, Andrea, let's see what comes. I'm not going to, you know, sit here and prejudge. But what I will say is that the investigations that are underway as to the Russian involvement in our electoral process are very important, they're very serious, and every American ought to have an interest in those investigations going wherever the evidence indicates they should.

149,HANNITY," Here with reaction Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. Senator, so that was a nice pivot on her part to talk about Russia. We've had eight months of conspiracies, no evidence at all. But she contradicted, as we pointed out earlier in the show tonight, what she said two weeks ago, ""I don't know anything about this."" And she's unmasking the identities of Americans caught up in incidental intelligence gathering and unmasking who these people are.",5,440.0,75.0,host,121.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
150,"SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY."," I didn't get a ""yes"" or a ""no"" from that answer that she gave. But the question I would ask Susan Rice is she came before Congress, did you discuss with the president that you were unmasking Trump transition officials? In what world would it ever have been appropriate for White House staff, White House political staff, to be unmasking conversations, highly classified and private conversations with Trump, General Flynn, and others? I see no world in which that would be appropriate. She needs to be made to answer for this. This is not a benign thing because it gives a black eye to the entire intelligence community if they're gathering up these private conversations and if they're going to be released to the media. This is a big crime and we need to get to the bottom of it.",5,782.0,141.0,guest,122.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
151,HANNITY," I agree with you. And more and more I'm getting convinced based on the evidence that's coming out that they used the ruse of this is legitimate intelligence gathering, but it seems that real intelligence gathering was spying on Trump and spying on then candidate Trump, and then spying on Trump, the president-elect Trump. And it went on for a long time.",5,355.0,63.0,host,123.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
152,PAUL," And there really is no excuse. There was a great article in National Review by Andrew McCarthy where he talks about who are the investigative arms? If someone were investigating a Russian tie, would it be the White House doing the investigation? Would it be Susan Rice's job? No. It would be the FBI, the NSA, or the CIA, but it would in no world be Susan Rice's job. So I think it's pretty important that we understand that millions of Americans are caught up in this web of intelligence collection. Millions of Americans' phone calls are caught up. And we can't allow them to look at Americans' phone calls without a warrant just because they disagree with us politically. This is very, very dangerous to our republic.",5,721.0,129.0,guest,124.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
153,HANNITY," I really agree. Because the issue of privacy, then America becomes a police state. Let's be honest here. If private confidential information is being revealed and unmasked and then leaked, then there is no such thing as privacy.",5,229.0,39.0,host,125.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04
154,PAUL," And I have been asking for reforms to this for a long time because these are the backdoor searches that many of us are concerned about. And I think there need to be reforms. For example, if they are listening to a conversation with another branch of government, the legislative branch, they need to hang up. They need to not be eavesdropping. It's not that they shouldn't just unmask our conversation. They should not have the president, or the executive branch should not be allowed to eves drop on the legislative branch's private phone calls.",5,546.0,96.0,guest,126.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04

156,PAUL," When I sit down with the president I do feel we have a kinship and I do think understand each other. We are obviously different individuals. We have some differences. We haven't been in the same place on this health care bill. But I do think he wants the same thing that I want. And that is that we want to repeal Obamacare. This has united Republicans for six years. The initial bill did not do that. I think the bill is getting closer. And I think we should thank the House Freedom Caucus for actually not bowing down and not just taking any old bill. The House Freedom Caucus has fought tooth and nail and taken a lot of barbs from a lot of establishment Republicans, but they're making the bill better. and so I think there's a chance that we can get to a good bill, but we should thank the House Freedom Caucus for that.",5,826.0,159.0,guest,128.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-04

40,HANNITY," Oh, you don't like the facts, just claim racism and sexism. Now, President Trump, he's not letting the media define this narrative. And earlier today, he said, quote, ""It's such an important story for our country and the world. It's one of the big stories of our time."" So here's the challenge. Will the partisan destroy press media treat the story with the importance it deserves? Will they continue to weaponize and politicize national intelligence, reveal the names of innocent Americans when there is no warrant to spy on them? Will they ever get to the bottom of who classed -- who released and classified (sic) information and intel about Michael Flynn? Will the media -- how's this? -- will they ever apologize for ridiculing President Trump over his surveillance claims now that he is proven right? My message is clear. ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, all of the -- their friends at the national print media, The New York Times, Washington Post -- it's time to realize that your level of partisanship and hatred for the president has now gotten away and totally clouded your judgment in what is now one of the biggest scandals in American history! Now, maybe you do something right for once. Maybe admit you're biased. Maybe apologize to the American people. Maybe apologize to the president because your veil of unbiased journalism is a sham!  Don't hold your breath. I'm not expecting the apologies. Joining -- or the corrections. Joining us now from the American Center for Law and Justice, Jay Sekulow, from Circa News, Sara Carter.

As a journalist, I mean, my job is to be a watchdog and to investigate and to be a watchdog on the government and on agencies and on the -- you know, with regard to the military, with regard to the Justice Department. And it's also to be a voice for the voiceless. It's not to be partisan. And what we've seen here with our investigation should raise alarm and should continue -- we should continue these investigations. It's not fair to the American people when they are not being served by the media. We're supposed to be the fourth estate. We're supposed to be part of those checks and balances. And when we don't do that, we fail our own system and we fail the American people!",1,726.0,137.0,guest,32.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05
42,HANNITY," Jay, two weeks ago, we know that Susan Rice -- I don't know anything about this. But then she admitted to the unmasking. Why -- can you think of any circumstances why Susan Rice, national security adviser, would need to unmask a Trump transition team member or a candidate or a part of the candidacy team of Donald Trump?",1,322.0,60.0,host,33.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05
43,"JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE"," Well, the reason is politics. I mean, and whatever she says -- you know, her denials fall flat, number one. I mean, who's going to believe Susan Rice? I said yesterday she's the liar chief here. I mean, so if you look at just the facts that we know and know about the -- she's acknowledged now the unmasking, that she was the principal that authorized and asked for the unmasking. You ask yourself the timing of this is not just bizarre, it's the real evidence! So this was -- other than politics, what could this possibly be, because between then and now, nothing has happened. No information has gotten out or that any other intelligence agency has said that there's been any collusion between the Trump campaign, Trump campaign officials and the Russians. In fact, to the contrary. So the president was right! He used the phrase -- and he undersold it. He said, you know, wiretaps, which is kind of the vernacular of surveillance. It was much more than wiretaps evidently, it was electronic surveillance. And Sean, I just want to call it what it is. They were spying on him and his incoming administration. That's what it appears to be. And the media ignoring this as if it does not exist or dismissing it because there's nothing that Susan Rice could possibly have done that's wrong -- she would not pass the character witness test if you were putting her up in a trial.",1,1375.0,248.0,guest,34.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05

By the way, just like she lied on five Sunday shows when she said a spontaneous demonstration where the demonstrators just happened to have mortars and RPGs in their back pocket at the time, so they decided to take them out just because they felt like it. But she only admits to the unmasking, Sara. She doesn't admit to leaking the intelligence. That is directly related to your reporting because since 2011, they relaxed the rules as it relates to unmasking. So really, it made it easier to spy and look at the names of those people that were picked up through incidental intelligence that we don't have warrants on. Right or wrong?",1,733.0,131.0,host,37.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05
47,CARTER," And this is -- right. And this is why it is so important as a journalist that I continue to investigate this. And this is why it's so important that other news agencies continue and begin to investigate this because one of the things we have to figure out, was our intelligence weaponized? Was this part of a political espionage?  And you know, Sean, she may not get charged with anything. And that's absolutely true because the rules were so relaxed -- and people have to understand this. The rules were so relaxed that all she had to do was make that request to the NSA and say, Due to national security matters, I need to see this information.

Did President Obama, members of his administration knowingly surveil President Trump and members of his transition team and incoming opposition party? We continue with Jay Sekulow and Sara Carter.

55,SEKULOW," You know, with regard to Susan Rice, Sean (INAUDIBLE) legal thing, I would look at the conspiracy statute under the Espionage Act, 793F, because it makes it a felony if you conspire with someone. So the fact that she did not, possibly, do the actual release, she did the unmasking, but she did not put in place, so to speak -- she didn't release the -- leaked the information to the press and elsewhere, that's not the end of the story.  The question is, number one, but for Susan Rice's actions, these leaks would not have happened. That's number one. Number two, did individuals she speak (ph) with or have contact with or dealt with -- did they put in place a series of events that led to the leaking and that Susan Rice was fully aware of? I would start looking at the Espionage Act, the conspiracy, of course. You know, leaking confidential information is a felony, as well. But this is a -- this is the typical situation a prosecutor would look at and say, Is there a conspiracy of multiple people engaged in action which resulted in the crime? Each individual person could have had their share of it. They didn't have to do all...",2,1138.0,210.0,guest,43.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05

59,SEKULOW," Well, I hope the grand jury is already empaneled, number one. I don't know that, but I would hope that's the case. So that's clear that a grand jury should be empaneled and the FBI should do a real investigation. Look, James Comey engages in selective disclosure of his activities. I mean, that's clear.

63,CARTER," I actually do, Sean. And I think this goes right down to the civil liberties of Americans. I think that's why this is such an important topic and a reason why the House and Senate need to investigate. And remember, Director Comey is investigating the Russian hacking of the U.S. election, and that encompasses everything else. And a lot of those FISA intercepts with Michael Flynn came from that side. But if we look at what happened with Susan Rice, I certainly think we need to know what she was looking at, why she was looking at it. And she's not in charge of any investigation, Sean. That is not her purview. That is not her job. She is more the managerial person, the national security adviser. So why was she looking at this?

I think you heard some snippets about that today. I was dragooned into service on the Benghazi select committee for two years. That committee's purpose was to take down Hillary Clinton's numbers, but one of the central figures the Republicans went after and after and after was Susan Rice. And after two years, they could find nothing that Rice did wrong. In fact, the only thing that Susan Rice did was go on Sunday morning shows and repeat what the intelligence committee (sic) best assessment of the early hours of Benghazi was.  That was consistent with what we were hearing, what Susan Rice was hearing. And that's all they could find, which was perfectly appropriate on her part. So what it is they have about Susan Rice they like to go after her, I don't know.",3,923.0,167.0,guest,65.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05

She said she knew nothing about it, and then yesterday, she admitted she knew everything about it. And she also lied back in 2012 on the five Sunday shows after the Benghazi terror attack.  There's no need for the Republicans to have to paint her as anything. She's a known liar! But instead of focusing on Rice's outright lies on the Trump surveillance, Schiff is now changing the subject.  Now, maybe it's time for him, Adam Schiff, to recuse himself from this Russia investigation. So tonight we asked Congressman Schiff to be a guest on this program. He hasn't responded yet. Shocking.

104,CROWLEY," Yes, and I agree with Bill on this. And there's a reason why Congressman Schiff is out there trying to deflect from the real story. What I'm hearing is that this case is moving toward a special counsel on a Watergate level scale. And the reason is because the congressional investigators can't get to the actual intelligence documents. The intelligence community, the agencies have locked the door on the investigators in terms of getting to the bottom of all of this.   The FBI, which is also running a parallel investigation, also may in fact be compromised. They may be involved in this matter. Why? Because Director Comay came out and said that they had been investigated in the Trump campaign and the Trump folks since July. They can't be running an investigation without surveillance, right? So the FBI may in fact be caught up in this matter as well, meaning that the Republicans may in fact suggest the idea of a special counsel. Everybody hates the idea and it's a terrible solution, but it may be the only one. ",3,1022.0,183.0,guest,86.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05

115,HANNITY," That was Susan Rice only two weeks ago when she told PBS she knew nothing about the surveillance of the Trump transition team and members and the president-elect. In a shocking turn of events multiple sources now confirming that Susan Rice did know about the surveillance and was in fact responsible for the unmasking of Trump officials.  Earlier today when asked by The New York Times if he thought Susan Rice had committed a crime, the president responded, quote, ""Do I think? Yes, I think.""  Joining us now with reaction, deputy assistant to the president, Dr. Sebastian Gorka. All right, you know a thing or two about intelligence but you also know a thing or two about if somebody two weeks ago, ""I don't know anything about this,"" and then it's revealed she is doing the unmasking, she's got herself a huge credibility problem. But beyond that, what is she saying here by admitting unmasking? ",4,900.0,159.0,host,94.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05
116,"DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, AUTHOR, ""DEFEATING JIHAD"""," I think, Sean, you've accurately identified how the story is falling apart. If you compare what she said two weeks ago, if you compare just the difference in her statements in the last 36 hours, there's clearly something that is not being openly discussed or disclosed here. If you follow the discussions, the writing of people like Andy McCarthy and others, there's the whole issue of FISA without FISA. So the potential for politically motivated use of the intelligence community to spy on individuals without the adequate warrants being obtained or the adequate permissions being followed and simply using the authority she had as national security advisor to unmask individuals, and then add to it eight days before the inauguration saying we're going to just be able to share this incredibly sensitive signals intelligence intercepts with thousands of more people across government. You put all the pieces together, and you see it's not just smoke. There's actually flames behind the smoke. ",4,997.0,163.0,guest,95.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05
117,HANNITY," What you are describing is the weaponizing, if you will, the politicizing of our intelligence agencies, and it would have to have been done by the top people. As you know, I have deep respect for those in intelligence. They put the lies on the line for us regularly. Their job is imperative in a world that has this much evil in it. But if you are going to use raw intelligence and unmask people that are political opponents, I mean, to me this sounds like the beginning of a police state. Am I overstating that? ",4,514.0,98.0,host,96.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05
118,GORKA," It's at least a banana republic. The weaponization of the security services is what you expect in a banana republic and a police state, or an authoritarian state. And let's look at one more piece of evidence. These individuals are politically appointed. I am politically appointed. I serve as a commissioned officer of the president, so did she. So we understand that. But you're supposed to be a professional. I challenge your viewers right now to go to her Twitter feed and read her tweets after January the 20th and read her colleagues Ben Rhodes and Colin Kahl, K-a-h-l. You will see who these people really are. The mask was taken off. Just three weekends ago Colin Kahl used the word ""purge"" with regards to people like myself and Steve Bannon and the other people in the White House who they think should not be there. ""Purging"" is the kind of word that Maoists use. That's the kind of word that was used to get rid of people that you politically disagree with perhaps even in violent ways. So these people have unmasked themselves, Sean. ",4,1047.0,187.0,guest,97.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05
119,HANNITY," But Dr. Gorka, it should be the type of thing, as I understand, to even have access to this information, this process of unmasking. That it is in a secure area, that you are escorted in, that every single bit of the raw intelligence that you are looking at should be recorded, all of this should be available to the American people. Why is it not being released in the sense that we know -- did she only asked for the unmasking of either candidate Trump, president-elect Trump, the transition team, members of his cabinet? Did they only act in this case, which would prove that it's all politicized and weaponized? ",4,616.0,113.0,host,98.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05
120,GORKA," Look, the president has been explicit here, Sean. We're going to allow the mandated authorities, the congressional committees to do their work. We're not going to do witch hunts. That's what the left radical, progressive political elite does with their enemies. So we're going to let the system deal with this as it should.  But again, your guests, I listen to your radio show as I was coming in to the show today. You had a former operative talk about how it's not rocket science to engineer a network analysis of telephone calls, who is calling who. If you want to attack me or Steve Bannon or Steve Miller or Kellyanne Conway, you say, oh, they regularly call their nephew in Canada. That's a foreigner. I don't need the same kind of intelligence or authorities to intercept a foreign call. And then you start to find a way to unmask all of these conversations so that you can make political profit.  That's a very, very tenable theory, and that's the kind of thing we have to find out if it was really happening, because if that's the case, that is weaponizing intelligence for political purposes against your other party.

125,HANNITY," Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So Susan Rice is once again in hot water. Nothing new for the former Obama national security advisor who became infamous in 2012 for blatantly lying about the Benghazi attacks on five Sunday morning shows. Now that one of his top officials is once again fending off claims of impropriety, where's President Obama? Why isn't he defending his former national security advisor?  We recently actually reached out to former president Obama to join us on this program, but, surprise, surprise, he declined the invitation. Joining us with reaction, FOX News contributor Lisa Boothe and conservative author, commentator, Michelle Fields. Michelle, I get that Obama is not good to comment on it, I understand. But from the perspective of what Susan Rice said two weeks ago, knowing she lied on those five Sunday shows, why would anyone take anything she says at this point seriously?

126,"MICHELLE FIELDS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," Yes. Look, it's very suspicious that she went on PBS and said that the unmasking never happened. And it's also suspicious the leaking of the Trump official names that were unmasked. However, there is no one that's suggesting other than the president that what she did was illegal. Is it not illegal as of yet. I think that right now we don't have all of the information that we need, and so I think that's why he's probably not coming out there. Obama is probably rejoining his time retiring. He's out on the beach, vacationing, he doesn't want to get involved in this. ",5,571.0,105.0,guest,104.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05

128,"LISA BOOTHE, COLUMNIST, WASHINGTON EXAMINER"," Yes, and Sean, I think that context is really important, that President Obama and the Obama administration did change those rules so that information could be more widely and easily disseminated across the government. But Sean, it is a big problem if the Obama administration essentially weaponized U.S. intelligence to spy on a political opponent. That's what seems to be shaping up here. And if that's in fact what happened, we have big problems on our hands here.  This is an administration that has problems with the truth. It's not just suspicious. Susan Rice has already discredited herself in a matter of weeks just since March 22nd alone. This is an administration that also lied -- ",5,692.0,119.0,guest,106.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05

136,HANNITY," Guys, nobody can hear you.  Here's what Sara Carter, who has been really on top of this. I've also interviewed a lot of people within the intelligence community and people with CIA backgrounds, and they all tell me the same thing. Raw intel is so sensitive and not corroborated. Remember, to surveill an American citizen you need a warrant. So if we incidentally in the process of the NSA doing their job they pick up an American, there's a process called minimization where you don't reveal who the American is and you minimize what information they are saying unless they are reporting a crime of some kind. And usually the standard operating procedure, Michelle, is that you write ""an American,"" you don't reveal their information. Why is she seeking a reveal, unmask just on Trump people. That doesn't seem odd to you? ",5,824.0,145.0,host,111.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05
137,FIELDS," I do think it probably is odd at the national security advisor if you're getting a report that's talking about foreign officials talking about White House officials who are going to be coming into the White House. Therefore she may have needed to unmask more information to understand the report more clearly. But we don't know. Like I said, we don't have enough information to figure out whether this was political. It's possible that it was. ",5,445.0,78.0,guest,112.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05
138,HANNITY, Let's play a word game here. What other reason would there be that she is looking for the unmasking only as it relates to the Trump transition and maybe candidate Trump? What other possible reason could there be --,5,215.0,40.0,host,113.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05

140,BOOTHE," What's been reported, Sean, is the fact that a lot of this information had little to do with national security interests. That's the question here is the motivation behind this. If, in fact, she was doing this, this absolutely has problems. Sean, we already know for a fact that the Obama administration has abused this sort of spying intel already on James Rosen as well as the Associated Press. So there's already been instances of abuse by the Obama administration.",5,469.0,81.0,guest,115.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-05
141,HANNITY," There's more than that, too, because we know that the IRS was used as a weapon against conservative groups leading up to the 2012 election to kind of suppress their effectiveness. But what's so serious about this is if we take this to its conclusion, and now that we know she unmasked these people and then we know she lied about it, what was she trying to hide two weeks ago, Michelle?

That was earlier this week.  Joining us now from the Pentagon tonight is Jennifer Griffin with the very latest -- Jennifer.",1,402.0,69.0,host,1.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
1,"JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX CORRESPONDENT"," Sean, I think what's notable from the president's statement tonight is that he pointed out that Shayat airbase, which was targeted by these 50 Tomahawk missiles, was the site where they believe that the chemical weapon was assembled, the sarin gas agents, the agents are put together before they are weaponized, put on board that Sukhoi 24 that took off and flew those 120 miles to the Khan Sheikhoun village where they bombed those families, those children, women and Chicago who were sleeping in their beds.  And it was those images of children suffering to breathe that seemed to have really particularly affected President Trump. And what I'm told here at the Pentagon, is that discussions, high-level discussions have taking place for the past 48 hours. The Joint Chiefs met in the Tank this evening to discuss the final military plan.  This was a limited military strike on that one base. But Sean, remember, this was 50 Tomahawk missiles, each of 1,000 pounds warhead, landing on this one base, runways, aircraft. It is an airbase that has been used by the Russians in the past. We saw, in fact, images from a year ago where there were Russian helicopters and warplanes at that base.  This was a message to President Bashar Assad that chemical weapons, the use of chemical weapons against one's own people would not be accepted by the United States of America.  We have received a statement from Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham praising the president's action tonight, saying that the American people should back him, and that, in fact, this was a sign of leadership, a tactic that should then be turned into a strategy, Senator John McCain saying repeatedly today that he believes that the U.S. military should take out Bashar Assad's air force so that he can no longer terrorize his own people -- Sean.",1,1820.0,316.0,guest,2.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
2,HANNITY," All right, Jennifer, I want to go to one issue here because the U.S. intelligence community said with high confidence they believe, of course, the attack was carried out by the Syrian government aircraft consistent A, with eyewitnesses that saw the winged aircraft launch the attacks and groups like al Nusra, the al Qaeda group in Syria, and ISIS don't have that fixed aircraft -- fixed-wing aircraft. So this was with very high confidence that, in fact, it was the Assad regime. And if we go back under the Obama administration, Assad and his government agreed to disband the chemical weapons and their capability in 2014, so that obviously didn't happen.",1,658.0,112.0,host,3.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
3,GRIFFIN," It's very clear, and we have been hearing from chemical weapons experts that, in fact, and Western intelligence sources, that, in fact, what is most clear in these recent days and weeks is that President Bashar Assad did not do what he said he was going to do and what the Obama ad administration said had happened, which is that he did not get rid of all of his chemical weapons.  It was largely assumed at the time that most of -- there were about 1,000 tons of chemical weapons that, remember, that were taken offshore. The U.S. And Russia actually cooperated at that time in 2013. The Cape Ray (ph), the USNS Cape Ray, was part of that removal of chemical agents. But it's very clear that Bashar Assad kept some chemical weapons, and those agents were stored, were told by the president tonight, at this Shayat airbase that was targeted about 120 miles from the site of the sarin nerve gas attack 72 hours ago, Sean.",1,921.0,170.0,guest,4.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
4,HANNITY," All right, Jennifer Griffin, thank you. And earlier this week, as the president had said with King Abdullah of Jordan, this crosses many, lines, beyond the red line, many, many lines, and of course, expressing his, well, thoughts about the loss of life and the use of this. Clearly, I think the president's goal to prevent any further mass casualty of civilians, sending a message to the rest of the world that this is not negotiable.  Joining us now live tonight from Jerusalem is John Huddy -- John.",1,502.0,90.0,host,5.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
5,"JOHN HUDDY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT"," Well, Sean, at this point, we're waiting to see what Israel's response is going to be. Obviously, Israel shares intelligence with the United States, and Israel has carried out almost on a daily basis or continually air strikes on Syrian targets, in particular Syrian convoys, armed convoys going to Hezbollah, and that's been a concern obviously here in Israel. Also, the other concern is Iran's involvement in Syria. So you know, really, what we're waiting for is the Israeli response to this, the intelligence aspects, and you know, some kind of response from Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister.  But you know, all of this -- you know, in the Golan Heights, Israel borders Syria. You know, certainly, there's always cross-border fire, you know, going into Israel. So all of this is a concern. It is a factor that's being looked at. And obviously, Israel's military, the Israeli air force, the IDF, Israel Defense Forces are on high alert at this point, Sean.",1,970.0,164.0,guest,6.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
6,HANNITY," All right, John Huddy in Israel tonight, thank you for joining us. Joining us now live from Mar-a-Lago, Florida, where the president is tonight is our own John Roberts. John, if we go back to this press conference earlier this week, the president did say this crosses many lines beyond a red line, many, many lines.  And we saw tonight I guess with this first military action very much in keeping what he said, we would not telegraph these things will be happening. And also, a very effective president in his statement tonight going on about this deadly nerve agent that choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children. And it was a slow and brutal death for so many What's the latest from Mar-a-Lago?",1,712.0,129.0,host,7.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
7,ROBERTS," When you look at the way that that was written -- and I expect that Steve Miller, who writes most of his speeches, had a hand in turning (ph) that, as well, when he said, No child of God it should ever suffer such horror. I mean, it's difficult not to have the world on your side when you're responding to something like that. And you see that the suffering of these children -- and Sean, that's just a video that would bring tears to your eyes regardless of whether you're a parent and you have your own children, when you see young children suffering like that, babies as well -- and the president specifically brought up the fact that there were babies who were involved here, as well, you just -- you wonder how does something like that ever happen?  It was clear when he was speaking with King Abdullah of Jordan yesterday there in the Rose Garden that he had been deeply, deeply affected by the pictures that he had seen. Add to that the fact that he had been very critical of President Obama for drawing of red line, and then when Bashar al Assad crossed it doing nothing about it, that the president said yesterday, it's crossed a number of lines, including red lines for me. He must have felt compelled at that point to do something about it.  But keep in mind -- and former a military leader said this earlier tonight -- that punishment is not strategy. So you can punish Bashar al Assad for doing what he did on Tuesday and making those people suffer so horribly, but you've got to have a strategy to back it up.  We saw Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, articulate the beginning of that in suggesting that the United States needed to build a coalition to defeat ISIS, to establish some sort of political process, and then have Bashar Assad to step aside. Well, that has been said before, where we have to defeat the enemy, and then you have to stand up a political process to get rid of the person who's the cause of the problem in the first place.  It hasn't worked out so well in the past, so it could raise questions, Sean, as to how it will work any better this time around -- Sean.",1,2104.0,399.0,guest,8.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
8,HANNITY," Well, John, I would just add to what you're saying here -- number one, it was in keeping with his campaign promises, and that is not to telegraphed military action. Number two, there's no indication the president has any inclination at all to go in and be an occupying force.  But certainly, this is a red line in the sand, that if Syria continues to attack innocent men, women and children with these weapons of mass destruction and slaughter innocent people -- this has been a seven-year civil war with mass atrocities, and the world for the most part has not done anything, I think this certainly sends a message to the entire world tonight that America is back and war crimes like this will not be tolerated.",1,713.0,130.0,host,9.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
9,ROBERTS," Yes. And I think, Sean, you could say that the message to Bashar al Assad tonight was, If you want to lose everything that you've got and be left pretty effectively defenseless, just keep on going the way that you're going because if we can take out one of your airbases, we can take them all out. We'll just move more ships into the region and fire more cruise missiles at you.  Now, in terms of telegraphing, the president has said on many, many occasions he didn't like the way the previous administration said, We're going to attack X target at X time on whichever day, and we want to let you know about it long, long in advance, maybe even months in advance when it came to the fight against Mosul, which was an example that he cited again and again and again. He wasn't going to telegraph what he was going to do.  We should point out, though, that the turnaround time for this, Sean, was very quick. This happened on Tuesday, and Thursday night, we're firing missiles.  So the president also showing tonight, though, that he is ready to swiftly take decisive action. He made up his mind that something had to happen. He went to Jim Mattis and he went to H.R. McMaster and said, Give me your best plan, said, I like it, go with it.",1,1238.0,235.0,guest,10.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
10,HANNITY," Yes. It seems to me that it's very clear goal was to prevent any further mass casualties. In many ways now, I would say the ball is now in President Assad's court.  Interesting coming on the heels of the president meeting with General el- Sisi the president of Egypt, and meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan and recently with a crown prince of Saudi Arabia, and of course, a very close relationship with the prime minister of Israel. Seemingly a new coalition has emerged in the entire Middle East waiting for their response tonight. John Roberts, stand by at Mar-a-Lago. We'll get back to you in a little bit.  Joining us now with new information is our own Jennifer Griffin once again -- Jennifer.",1,701.0,127.0,host,11.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
11,GRIFFIN," Sean, we've just gotten details from the Pentagon about those Tomahawk missiles that first landed at this Shayat airbase at 8:45 PM Eastern tonight. We understand the total number of Tomahawk' fired was 59 Tomahawks. Those two U.S. destroyers, the USS Porter and USS Ross, could carry up to 70 missiles, we were told. They have now fired 59 at this one airbase.  We're also told that should expect soon imagery, aftermath imagery from that airbase at Shayat. That is near the town of Ohms. It's about 120 miles from where the sarin gas attack occurred.  We also expect imagery released by the Pentagon of the flight path of the Russian -- sorry, excuse me -- the Syrian plane, the Sukhoi 24 that took off from the Shayat airbase and flew and dropped the sarin gas bomb on it that village 72 hours ago. The Pentagon to release that imagery soon.  We're told that this was -- the Pentagon is describing it as a proportional strike. We also are told that the Pentagon warned the Russians multiple times about this strike prior to the Tomahawk's landing at this airbase. They did so through a hotline that is established between the what is known as the CAOC (ph), the command center in the Middle East the U.S. -- that the U.S. uses, and Latakiya (ph), which is the base used by Russia inside Syria.  So there were multiple warnings to the Russians, commander to commander. Remember, General Joe Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, has met with his Russian counterpart recently in Turkey to establish and reestablish that hotline in the event of this kind of incident.  We also are told, Sean, that there were Russian forces at this base of Shayat until recently. It's not clear whether they were still there tonight. But again, the U.S. military did warn through that hotline Russian forces that they were going to carry out this Tomahawk strike today -- Sean.",1,1866.0,334.0,guest,12.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
12,HANNITY," There were interesting comments by one Russian diplomat earlier this week saying that their support is not unconditional as it relates to Syria and Assad, said (ph) after the attack. You had a great description earlier of these 18-foot-long 2-feet-wide thousand-pound Tomahawk missiles and their slow path (ph) trajectory. Can you explain that again for those that are just joining us?",1,386.0,62.0,host,13.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
13,GRIFFIN," Yes, Sean. In fact, remember the Tomahawk missile, a cruise missile was introduced, was first introduced during the Gulf war, the first Gulf war. And these are essentially flying telephone poles, if you will. They are fired from Navy destroyers, and they fly at about 500 miles per hour. So you can see them with the naked eye when they're flying.  They're about 18 feet long, two feet wide, and you can imagine that if they were -- once they were fired from the USS Porter and USS Ross, which were in the eastern Mediterranean, it could take up to 30, 45 minutes before they actually landed because they can be fired from 1,000 miles away. So those destroyers could be quite some distance away.  We also understand, Sean, that, you know, they can -- those two destroyers can carry up to 70 missiles. They've now fired 59. To resupply, we're told those Tomahawk missiles are stored at Suda Bay, which is a U.S. base in Crete, Greece. So those destroyers would have to resupply at this point in order to continue if there were any follow-on attacks.  Now, we understand that this is a limited attack, a proportional attack as the Pentagon said. It is designed to send a message to Bashar Assad, but also to the Russians that the U.S. has said that they are willing to work with the Russians possibly to fight against ISIS, that, you know, we have 1,000 U.S. troops on the ground in Syria preparing to help forces, Kurdish forces and others, other Syrian forces that the U.S. has trained to take Raqqa, which is the ISIS capital.  So this was designed to send a message to Bashar Assad to stop using chemical weapons, to never use chemical weapons again. He was a signatory in 2013 to the chemical weapons treaty, suggesting he wouldn't.  But another point, Sean, is that tonight, there was a meeting at the U.N. Security Council that was indecisive. And in prior administrations, I believe it would be safe to say that while the U.N. Security Council debated issues, a resolution on Syria and the chemical weapons attack, that a White House or an administration would have waited for those debates to finish. And tonight, we were told that the U.S. wanted a vote on the resolution. Russia was blocking it. They expected Russia to block the resolution in the end, as they have seven times in the past. And so this president did not wait. This president ordered a unilateral air strike against Syria to send...",1,2408.0,434.0,guest,14.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06

16,HANNITY," Obviously, there will be no -- this is to prevent further mass casualties and attacks. And a message has been sent. Before before I go to General Jack Keane, I wouldn't doubt that there are politicals out -- politicos out there that would make hay over the fact, knowing that at this particular airbase in Syria, that Russian soldiers were there, that they were tipped off. Here we go. We've had eight months of this -- this Russian conspiracy, so I wouldn't be surprised if that happens. But that would be standard operating procedure, would it not?",1,551.0,98.0,host,17.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
17,GRIFFIN," I think in a civilized world, that is what one does, military to military. In fact, it's notable that the timing of the Tomahawk air strikes would be at a time when there would be the fewest amount of people at that airbase. So this is designed to send a signal, to send a message. It was not designed to inflict casualties per se.  There are likely casualties at the base, but we'll be getting more details about that. But again, in -- you know, from a military perspective, it was the right thing to do to use this hotline that's been established between the two militaries to explain that we are not at war with Russia.",1,623.0,119.0,guest,18.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06

20,HANNITY," And also to add to that, Rex Tillerson, the sectary of state, said, clearly, Russia has failed in its responsibility to deliver on their commitment to stop these kind of attacks. Either Russia has been complicit or simply incompetent on delivering its end of that agreement. So clearly, strong statement and actions against Russia in this strike tonight. Jennifer Griffin, thank you. Stand by. We'll get back to you in just a few minutes. Joining us now live from Washington is General Jack Keane. General, militarily, this is a very big message that should be heard well beyond Syria tonight. What's your reaction to that?",1,624.0,106.0,host,21.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
21,"GEN. JACK KEANE, U.S. ARMY (RET.), FOX MILITARY ANALYST"," Well, definitely, you know, particularly, it's a major setback for Russia. Listen, they've enabled this regime. They have used their penetrative bombs to bomb underground hospitals. That's a war crime. They have largely conducted air strikes against the Syrian people themselves, just like the Assad regime has been doing.  And the fact of the matter is that they've vetoed a seven U.N. resolutions where the U.N. has tried to assign accountability to the Assad regime for this kind of criminal behavior. Setback for Putin here for sure, and the Iranians, as well, but the Iranians don't care.  Putin cares a little bit more about his image than the Iranians did. Other factor is, we know based on the three visits from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan that President Trump has absolutely revitalized the historical and traditional relationship that the United States has had from President Roosevelt up until President Obama. He has revitalized that relationship.  And he -- I am convinced now that he will get incredible cooperation out of the Sunni Arabs. The other thing -- he sent a loud message to the Iranians in the first month of his administration that, I'm not going to tolerate your trampling on the interests of the Middle East and taking advantage of using your proxies to do that and also developing ballistic missiles. I'm going to stand in your way from accomplishing that.  This is an incredible message that should've been sent many years ago by the Obama administration. Cross the chemical red line in 2013 was not just about dealing with retribution for a heinous act. It was taking advantage, Sean, of the opportunity to destroy the entire Assad air power which would have shifted the momentum against the regime and likely would have brought it down. We don't know that for a fact, but it was a likely possibility. ",1,1837.0,316.0,guest,22.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
22,"SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST"," General, let's get your thoughts on the world reaction tonight. North Korea is watching tonight, the Iranians are watching tonight. The Russians, as Rex Tillerson said, have been so ineffective and maybe even complicit earlier today, they are watching tonight. What is the message? How is this going to be received, that America is back after seven years of war crimes and death and misery and the use of these weapons, that it will no longer be tolerated, that the goal of this is to prevent any further mass casualty of civilians, that that will now be nonnegotiable with United States of America? ",1,601.0,105.0,host,23.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
23,KEANE," I think the president has been sending some messages since his inauguration. And I think the way the world reads him, there's all the campaign rhetoric to be sure, and some of it was not predictable in terms of what his actions would be as president. But I think when they look at him they see a strong, decisive leader who has had some success in leadership, and he sort of does what he says.  And now we see this act taking place where he said this is a heinous act and I'm not going to tolerate it. I'm good to act on behalf of humankind and do something about it. He's sending a message to the Chinese. He's telling the Chinese that, listen, the North Koreans are trying to weaponize intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the rhetoric is they will use them against my country and my people. Don't push me into a corner where I have to use a military option to deal with them. That would be horrific. That would mean a war on the Korean peninsula.  But at the same time, I cannot permit them to launch a missile against the United States. I think he'll get the Chinese attention for sure as a result of that. It's not rhetoric. We've had rhetoric for eight years with passivity and no action. Now he's taken a very limited action but it sends an incredible incredibly strong message to our adversaries in the world who are paying attention, believe me, Iran, China, Russia, paying attention.

25, KEANE," And the rogue state of North Korea, they are all paying attention to this. Listen, it's not a panacea for all of our problems to be sure. Not one military strike on one evening is going to change the world. But it is going to tell the world that we have a decisive president who is going to act on behalf of the U.S. national interests and the interests of our allies when he believes that's at stake. And that is an unequivocally loud, clear message. ",1,453.0,88.0,guest,26.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
26,HANNITY," All right, and thank you, general. We'll get back to you later in the hour. Thanks for being with us. Joining us now from Washington is Bret Baier, the host of ""Special Report"" here on the Fox News Channel.  Bret, you were making a point earlier with our own Shep Smith, Sunni Arab nations, the king of Jordan, the president, General el-Sisi of Egypt, the crown prince and of course the Israeli prime minister joining and creating a new coalition here. It seemed that because of all the news and this news cycle that the relationship has changed dramatically, especially with Jordan and Egypt now that we have a new president. What impact do you think this has based on their meetings earlier this week? ",1,705.0,128.0,host,27.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
27,"BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST"," Dramatically changed, Sean, I think you can say that without a doubt. I interviewed president el-Sisi just the other night from Egypt, and he talked extensively about feeling confident that he can work and Arab leaders can work with this president. And I asked him specifically about Russia and how they got involved in such a foothold inside this region. And I said, do you think the vacuum left by the Obama administration enabled Russia to take a greater foothold in your region? And he said, quote, ""In fact many things over the last four years occurred and caused many, many problems. That's a fact. The region is paying a very heavy price for that, not just in Syria, the entire region is paying a price."" And asked if he thought he could turn it around with or without the U.S., he said ""It can't happen without the U.S."" So I do think there is a different sense about the coalition, Sean.  But to the point that General Keane was just making, this does protect strength, it does project strength not only in the Middle East which answers to strength greatly as we've seen in the past, but also to China and North Korea in that issue. ",1,1143.0,210.0,guest,28.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
28,HANNITY," And also Russia, right, Bret? I mean, a lot of people might go off on an issue that we have a relationship where they were given a heads- up, but on the broader side of this, they were also told by our secretary of state that they might, a, be complicit, b, be incompetent as it relates to resolving the issues involving Syria and especially the chemical weapons issue. ",1,371.0,71.0,host,29.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
29,BAIER," That's right. And you had this off-camera briefing that's been going on down in Mar-a-Lago with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, just getting notes about it from the pool in which Tillerson says this was a very deliberate process and examination of options, that the president made the right choice. No conversations prior or since with Moscow, however continuing that there was a de-confliction, with military de-confliction they defer to the Pentagon, normal channels open for de-confliction as there a number of Russians at this base. I do want to point out one thing, and that is to your point earlier about a candidate who campaigned against waging war who as president changes that 180 degrees. It seems like the events in Syria had changed how President Trump had looked at it. Obviously as civilian Trump he tweeted a number of things back in 2013 when President Obama announced the red line. There is pushback within the party, Sean. Senator Rand Paul tweeting ""While all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked. The president needs congressional authorization for military action as required by the constitution. Our prior interventions in this region have done nothing to make us safer, and Syria will be no different."" So there are a lot, as you know, Sean, of Trump supporters who could buy into what Senator Paul is saying tonight, but you have the president who was acting based on -- ",1,1476.0,249.0,guest,30.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
30,HANNITY," We saws in the last couple of days a president when he said this crosses many, many lines, beyond a red line, many lines. And then in his statement tonight, almost a very emotional statement by him about how Syrian president, dictator Assad launched a horrible weapons attack on innocent civilians using a deadly nerve agent, choking out the lives of helpless men, women, and children, and how it is in the vital national security interests of the U.S. to prevent and deter the spread of deadly chemical weapons. I don't think anybody could deny that, but it also is in keeping with his promise not to telegraph military action. There is no indication at all tonight of an idea of an invasion or occupation. It's to send a message. And I've got to believe that that message was probably received loud and clear in Syria and wherever Assad may be hiding out this evening. ",1,872.0,157.0,host,31.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
31,BAIER," And in Moscow, definitely. But you have to concede that the message for President Trump is clearly different than civilian Trump in August of 2013 when he was tweeting President Obama, saying don't get involved in Syria, don't do it, don't get drawn in, focus on America, and that was after chemical weapons attack back then. So it was the same choking of kids and fathers and mothers in 2013. His thoughts about it have evolved, you have to concede that. ",1,457.0,83.0,guest,32.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
32,HANNITY," I do concede that. I see the tweet that you are referring to, and that is true. Also consistent, though, with his decisive action, but yes, you're right on the tweet. Bret Baier, ""Special Report,"" thank you.  John Roberts, he just got of the briefing with Secretary of State Tillerson and the national security adviser, McMaster. John, what is latest there? ",1,359.0,64.0,host,33.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
33,"JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT"," I'm going through my notes here, Sean. First of all, H.R. McMaster, the national security advisor, said that this was aimed at Bashar al-Assad's capacity to commit murder with chemical weapons. This was taken in the middle the night in a way, and the targeting was done in such a way to minimize casualties, particularly third-party casualties which could be read as Russians because there are some Russian forces who were embedded here at these airfields. And he very specifically said that the missiles were targeted to avoid hitting the stockpiles of Sarin gas that were housed at that airbase. So this was to take out the ability to deliver this gas, probably to put a lot of holes in the runways there as well, but to take careful steps to avoid hitting those stockpiles of the chemical weapons.  Here is the deliberative process that they went through. There were initial consultations with the president about what happened in Syria, about the nature of the attack and what was used. The NSC then last night met to deliberate a number of options. They told the president about that this morning before he left. He had some more questions about that. That's when this afternoon the national security advisor and the secretary of state met with him at Mar-a-Lago to answer those questions. They went over a number of options. Some of the options, and they didn't get into the details, weren't quite as palatable as the one that they took tonight  So the president weighed those options and decided to act. According to both the secretary of state and the national security advisor, quote, ""This demonstrates that this president will act when governments don't behave and clearly indicates,"" Sean, ""that he is willing to take decisive action.""  The secretary of state again said that seeing the scenes of what happened there in Syria after that apparent chemical weapons attack, and it was apparently Sarin gas that was used, which is particularly horrible, really kind of changed his views how horrible these weapons are.  Then asked Secretary Tillerson what the diplomatic calculation was about all of this, because there are so many different players involved. There's Russia, there's Syria, there's Turkey, there are the Kurds, there's Iran as well. He said that expected that every one of those players with the exception of Russia, Iran, and Syria would probably applaud what was happening, and then went into a lengthy explanation of what he hopes to do in the future. And that is to build a coalition to defeat ISIS, to bring regional groups together, to stabilize the area, and then try to set forward some sort of political process that could end up with the replacement of Bashar al-Assad as the leader of Syria. Sean?",1,2734.0,469.0,guest,34.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
34,HANNITY," Obviously the president did change his point of view, especially if you look at tweet from a number of years ago. But we've got to this morning, too, not every military action is a full-fledged war here. And I think the goal is very obvious to prevent any further mass casualty of civilians. And it was clear for the president giving his statement tonight, and we will replay that. This had an emotional impact on him because of the long suffering and the death of innocent men, women, and children that were targeting here.  We have reactions coming in, John. Syrian TV calling this an act of aggression. Senators McCain and Graham and Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton and Bill Nelson and Bob Corker all supporting the president's action. Then Democrat Dick Durbin, ""Any further action would require scrutiny of Congress,"" similar statement by Senator Ben Cardin. But obviously this is a very different reaction and clearly a red line that actually means something. John, we'll get back to you in a few minutes, John Roberts down at Mar-a-Lago tonight, thank you.  Earlier tonight, after this news broke that the U.S. had in fact watch these airstrikes at this air base in Syria, the president did explain his decision to take this military action in retaliation to the government using chemical weapons against its own people, including men, women, and children. Here's what he said earlier. ",1,1389.0,240.0,host,35.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06

36,PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP," My fellow Americans, on Tuesday Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians. Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women, and children. It was a slow and brutal death for so many. Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. No child of God should ever suffer such horror.  Tonight I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in the vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the chemical weapons convention, and ignored the urging of the U.N. Security Council.  Years of previous attempts at changing Assad's behavior have all failed and failed very dramatically. As a result, the refugee crisis continues to deepen and the region continues to destabilize, threatening the United States and its allies.  Tonight I call on all civilized nations to join us in seeking to end this slaughter and bloodshed in Syria and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types. We ask for God's wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world. We pray for the lives of the wounded and for the souls of those who have passed. And we hope that as long as America stands for justice then peace and harmony will in the end prevail. Goodnight, and God bless America and the entire world.

38,HANNITY," ""No child of God should suffer such horror."" And the president goes on to say ""Tonight I call on all civilized nations to join us in seeking the end of the slaughter and the bloodshed in Syria.""  Joining us now live from Washington is Senator Marco Rubio who put out a supportive statement earlier tonight. Senator, your reaction to the president's actions here? ",1,364.0,66.0,host,37.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
39,"SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA."," It was the right decision for a number of reasons. Number one, Assad had signed an agreement not to have chemical weapons. It was an agreement that the Russians and the United States were signatories to end and a part of. They also signed the convention not to have weapons, and then they had a U.N. Security Council resolution on them as well. They have violated that and therefore there needed to be a consequence for that. Someone needs to enforce it. Russia is not going to enforce it. They're helping them. And therefore, that was number one. Number two, come I think it's important to remember there are hundreds of Americans stationed in that region very near to that place, and this guy is using Sarin gas. It could ultimately be used against our own troops. And that cannot be allowed to stand. So it is in our national security interests.  Number three, I hear a lot of talk, and I'm not saying you but others that this is a symbol or message. It certainly has a messaging component. But he struck a military base that was used not just for chemical attacks but potentially for future chemical attacks. And so it had a strategic objective that was very clear, and he dedicated significant resources, 59 Tomahawk missiles, to destroying a particular airbase. That is how you conduct military attacks. You have an objective and you dedicate the resources to achieve it, and the armed forces of the United States, as they always do, did so.  So the president had the legal authority to act, the moral authority to act, and, quite frankly, the military strategy to be successful at it. It was the right decision that he made. ",1,1633.0,294.0,guest,38.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
40,HANNITY," I agree. The Pentagon just put a statement, senator, Russian forces were notified in advance of the strike, using the established de- confliction line, this is something you know a lot about. Can you explain it? ",1,213.0,38.0,host,39.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
41,RUBIO," Obviously there are military to military contacts in the region with the Russians and others, and the reason why you do that is not some conspiracy. I've been as tough on all that as anybody else. It's simply because their objective was not to kill anybody. Their objective was to destroy a facility so that they couldn't fly the planes to conduct more attacks.  The way that they are using these chemical weapons is they are dropping them from the airplanes, and that is the airfield that they are flying those attacks from. They've conducted chlorine bombs attacks from that not airfield and that conducted the Sarin attack from that airfield. And so the objective of this mission was not to kill Russians. It was to destroy an airbase so Assad could not use it in the future. And so that is an appropriate thing to do. It has nothing to do with some sort of nefarious conspiracy theory that some might come up with --",1,921.0,168.0,guest,40.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
42,HANNITY," Senator, we'll save the conspiracy theories for the mainstream media because they live and die by them, eight months of conspiracies with no evidence. But on a serious note, senator, whenever military action is taken, you have to prepare for potential consequences or the reaction of others. In anticipation of this, what would you say that our military is preparing for at this moment in terms of Syria's reaction and in terms of Russia's reaction? ",1,451.0,77.0,host,41.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
43,RUBIO," First is the potential targeting of our troops in Iraq and in Syria, that's number one. That's the first thing I would anticipate. The other is some sort of Russian stepping up their air campaign against elements on the ground. Of course they have done a special forces amount already.  But I also think that the consequences of not acting would have been very severe. Not acting would've probably led to more chemical attacks. They could have inadvertently at some point even targeted American troops or American interests in the region with Sarin gas.  The other point that I would make with regards to all of this and what was going on there was at the end of the day what is the point of all these resolutions and all these agreements that the United States is signing onto, because people forget back in 2013, 2014 the Russians and the United States entered into this agreement that the Syrians were not going to have chemical weapons. They have chemical weapons. They've been using chlorine bombs and now they use Sarin again, and this is nothing but legally an effort to enforce, those requirements. The Russians aren't going to enforce it. They're helping them. This is important. And can I say one more thing, Sean. I think it was evident yesterday anybody who saw the press conference, the president standing next to the king of Jordan, he was deeply moved by what he saw and was he was exposed to.

45,RUBIO, Absolutely. And that's something that can't be ignored. I said that earlier today. He clearly was impacted by it. And I think that that's an important consideration here as well. ,1,180.0,32.0,guest,44.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
46,HANNITY," One last question on Russia which has been supporting and propping up and assisting Assad regime, Rex Tillerson, our secretary of state, called out Russia earlier saying they failed in their responsibility to deliver on their commitments especially as it relates to these weapons and either Russia has been complicit or incompetent in delivering that end of the agreement. That to me is a clear sign that this administration was willing to take on any consequences as it relates to both Syria and Russia.  And I also think the big message here tonight and the takeaway tonight is this is a message to the world that they want to prevent any further mass casualty of civilians, and I would say the message is that's nonnegotiable. Is that how you interpret that? ",1,763.0,134.0,host,45.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
47,RUBIO," Obviously, look, I think the objective tonight was the destruction of that airbase. But if you want to know who's getting a message tonight in regards to all this, I think if you are in North Korea and you see this tonight and you start to wonder whether these are people you want to be messing with. I think if you are Iran, you're starting to think about whether these are people you want to be messing with. And obviously I think if you are Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin, you realize that things have changed. And in fact there are things that you are doing that are against the national security interest of the United States. We're not going to spend two weeks looking for some letter. We're going to be action to protect our interest. That's a big change from what we've had over the last eight years. ",1,814.0,152.0,guest,46.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
48,HANNITY," Senator, thank you for your time tonight, we appreciate it.  Joining us now is former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich. Mr. Speaker, your reaction to the president's actions tonight? ",1,208.0,36.0,host,47.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
49,"NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," I think there are a couple of very big takeaways. First, Donald Trump really loves children, he really loves babies. You could hear it in his voice tonight. And contrary to what Bret Baier said, being president of the United States, feeling the weight of the world, the very fact at the very end he said ""God bless the world,"" I've never heard a president say that. This guy was touched deeply, emotionally because he loves children. He sees it as his job as a parent to try to protect children, and I'm sure that he was just deeply troubled that as president he couldn't protect them. Second, this is an amazing week. The president of Egypt comes in, the king of Jordan comes in, they have conversations. You don't think they were talking through what to do in Syria? And it is an amazing moment, the Chinese premier is here, and he is wondering how serious the country is, the United States is. So after dinner, Donald Trump proves how serious the United States is. So the Chinese tomorrow have a whole left to digest when they listen to Donald Trump talk.  Lastly, we had eight years of a very articulate community organizer who did not have a clue about how to be president of United States. We have now had three months of the guy who knows how to be president, and I think he just proved it in the Ronald Reagan tradition, decisive, surgical, effective use of American power to do something to begin to hurt the Syrians. And to say to them, if you do this again I'll take out two or three more airfields. ",1,1512.0,282.0,guest,48.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
50,HANNITY," Mr. Speaker, maybe inadvertently, maybe Barack Obama in this horrific Iranian deal was able to create a coalition that nobody maybe even anticipated a decade ago, and that is that it brought Saudi Arabia, the Israelis, the Jordanians and the Egyptians into a new coalition. I think very few people have paid attention. ",1,320.0,55.0,host,49.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
51,GINGRICH," I think it's more than that. I think what Barack Obama proved for eight years is when America is weak among the world is unmanageable and dangerous. And so virtually every rational leader on the planet is eager to have a strong, decisive American president because then, you heard it said by el-Sisi, the president of Egypt, you heard it said by King Abdullah, the head of Jordan, if the United States does not play a decisive leading role worldwide, then it can't be done. I think what you're seeing is Donald Trump rise to the occasion, being prepared to actually be president and lead the world on behalf of the United States, and putting America first but recognizing that having lots of allies in a good sound neighborhood is a lot better than being alone in a jungle. ",1,775.0,141.0,guest,50.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
52,HANNITY," Is one of the messages tonight that there's no longer America leading from behind, America's leading in front and the world is getting a message tonight that America is back? ",1,176.0,32.0,host,51.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
53,GINGRICH," It's not a laughing matter, but probably if you were a Syrian or a Russian around that airfield right this minute, you wouldn't think we were leading behind. You would think that we had decisively responded, exactly what he had to do, don't give them a speech, don't create a red line, just hit them very hard. And then after you hit them explain to the world what they just saw. ",1,381.0,73.0,guest,52.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
54,HANNITY," That is really in keeping when you think about it. I thought one of the best things the president said during the campaign was you don't telegraph your military action all of the time. By the way, a military strike such as this is not a full-fledged war. I take issue with what Senator Rand Paul said. I don't think the president has any intention to invade or to occupy, but I do believe he had an intention of sending a message that if you are going to unleash these weapons of mass destruction against women and children, they are to be consequences. What is North Korea's reaction, Russia's reaction, what is China's reaction? What is the Iranian reaction tonight in your view? ",1,683.0,125.0,host,53.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
55,GINGRICH," You know, the Russian reaction in 1981 when we shot down the Libyan aircraft was that there was a new sheriff in town. I don't think of Donald Trump of Manhattan is a sheriff, but maybe there's a new police chief in town. And he is prepared to do what it takes.  And I think this is a very important day, but the week is important. You're going to have a conservative Supreme Court justice, you're going to have a serious meeting with the Chinese. You had very successful meetings with Egypt and Jordan, and you just demonstrated to the world that you are serious about protecting people and you are serious about doing things that are decisive. ",1,647.0,121.0,guest,54.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
56,HANNITY," I want to go back to my earlier question because I don't think the media paid enough attention. It seems like King Abdullah of Jordan and the president just hit it off. I don't think I've ever seen the king give more praise to any other leader than he did to President Trump. The same thing with General, President el-Sisi of Egypt. He recently met with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, and obviously said great words of praise for Prime Minister Netanyahu. ",1,460.0,85.0,host,55.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
57,GINGRICH," By the way, he got exactly the same treatment from president of Afghanistan who said that Trump is so much more helpful than Obama that it's night and day, and he's thrilled to have Trump leading because he feels Afghanistan has a dramatically better future with Donald Trump.  Now, ""The New York Times"" doesn't want to put together as part of their first 100 days of story how many world leaders are now saying they like working with Donald Trump and they trust him and they believe he's a serious man. So it's a remarkable turnaround. ",1,538.0,99.0,guest,56.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
58,HANNITY," Mr. Speaker, how would you respond? I look at the Pentagon statement and I look a little bit on my Twitter account when I've got moments here, and I read the Russian conspiracy theorists that have had no evidence but keep advancing a phony narrative for eight months would say the Russians were notified because we have a de-confliction line. ",1,344.0,62.0,host,57.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
59,GINGRICH, Of course the Russians were notified. People who are surprised that the Russians weren't notified are idiots. ,1,111.0,19.0,guest,58.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
60,HANNITY, I'm not the conspiracy theorist.,1,33.0,6.0,host,59.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
61,GINGRICH," I'm just saying blanket for our entire audience who are listening to you and me talk right now, if you run across a tweet from some guy who is shocked we told the Russian military we're coming in, get out of the way. We didn't call the Russian military and say, gee, could we come in. We called them and said -- we probably didn't call them. McMaster might have called his counterpart. ",1,387.0,75.0,guest,60.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
62,HANNITY, It was military to military. ,1,30.0,7.0,host,61.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
63,GINGRICH," Right. And he might well have said we are coming in, get out of the way. Don't try to stop us, don't get in the middle of this thing, because we're going to roll over you if you do. I think that's a pretty healthy signal. ",1,223.0,48.0,guest,62.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
64,HANNITY," I think it's a great signal, and I think the secretary of state couldn't have been stronger in his wording that Russia has failed in their delivery on their commitment as it relates to the Assad regime which they have been propping up. And they say either Russia has been complicit or incompetence in delivering on their end of the agreement. ",1,344.0,63.0,host,63.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
65,GINGRICH," So as people on this Thursday evening contemplate the first 100 days of Donald Trump, you have a very strong secretary of state, a very strong secretary of defense, a very strong set national security advisor, and a president who is stronger than all three of them. That's not a bad deal. ",1,290.0,54.0,guest,64.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
66,HANNITY," I think 50,000 pounds of Tomahawk missiles being dumped on one air base is going to say something. I don't see the Syrians reacting to this except to stand down. ",1,163.0,32.0,host,65.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06
67,GINGRICH," Unlike the Iranians, Assad does not have the capacity to wage war outside his own territory. He's losing ground steadily in his own territory. I would not be at all surprised in the near future to see a military coup take him out because he's much weaker than his father. He's lost over half the country, and they generally think he's an idiot. And I think there's a good chance Assad is going to be deposed. ",1,410.0,78.0,guest,66.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-06

0,"SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST"," And welcome to ""Hannity."" And this is a Fox News Alert. Just a little over 24 hours ago, President Trump sent a message that reverberated around the entire world that Syrian president Bashar al Assad's use of chemical weapons against his own people will not be tolerated, and the United States of America is once again willing to back up its words with brute force. Now, President Trump ordered a tactical Tomahawk missile strike against an airbase in Syria, the very same base that was used by the plane responsible for this chemical attack that killed dozens of innocent men, women, and yes, children. And according to reports, the U.S. action in Syria was highly effective, destroying around 20 Syrian warplanes and other crucial pieces of their infrastructure. And now as the dust settles, the Trump administration is now turning up the heat on Russia, the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, calling them, quote, ""complicit"" or, quote, ""simply incompetent"" in the Syrian chemical attack. Joining us now with more live from Mar-a-Lago, where the president is tonight, is our own John Roberts -- John.",1,1104.0,185.0,host,1.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07
1,"JOHN ROBERTS, FOX CORRESPONDENT"," Sean, good evening to you. And I'm told by press secretary Sean Spicer that the president is very pleased with the execution and the response to last night's cruise missile attacks against that airbase in Syria. The White House believes that in this particular case, the military performed, quote, ""magnificently."" Now, the big question is, what happens next? In terms of keeping the pressure on Assad, the United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley said today that the U.S. could take further action. She hopes it doesn't come to that, but sending a very, very strong warning to President Assad to say that, If you misbehave again with something like you pulled on Tuesday, we could potentially hit you again. And Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, said late today that he is about to announce more sanctions against the Syrian regime in order to try to stop these attacks, and not just the chemical attacks, Sean, but all of these attacks against Syrian civilians, hoping that by depriving people of being able to do business with Syria, that will put further pressure on the regime. Now to Russia because another one of the big questions is, what happens with the United States' relationship with Russia, Rex Tillerson saying this afternoon that he is disappointed by Russia's response, saying that it looks like they are still willing to go all in to back Bashar al Assad, reiterating that he's disappointed, but not surprised. We had statements from Dmitry Medvedev, the prime minister, Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister, the spokesman for Vladimir Putin all condemning the attack. But I am told, Sean, that there's a lot of public bluster going on here. And that include sending that Russian frigate through the Bosphorus into the eastern part of the Mediterranean, but that through the official diplomatic channels, there hasn't been a whole lot of blowback from Russia over this.  So they've got two tracks here. They've got the public posture, telling their populace that they're strong, that they're going to be talking about this in very strident terms with the United States. But then on the diplomatic side, it seems like they're much more muted in their response.  We'll get a greater sense next week of exactly what the relationship with Russia is in regard to this and where it might be going forward when it Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, meets with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Moscow -- Sean.",1,2435.0,411.0,guest,2.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07
2,HANNITY," You know, John, it's very interesting because we know that Russia earlier this week said their support -- this was after the chemical attack against men, women and children -- that they said their support for Bashar al Assad was not unconditional. So they kind of distanced themselves a little bit from this attack, or at least attempted to.  We are now getting pictures of the war room inside of Mar-a-Lago from last night, the secure war room that they set up there. And we'll put those up on the screen for our audience. But there's an interesting back story because the president was dining with the head of China, the premier of China, at the very moment those missiles were in the air. And I'm hearing the president had to lean over and tell him what was going on. Do you know anything about that?",1,804.0,148.0,host,3.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07
3,ROBERTS," Yes, well, here's the tick-tock sort of the final day because there were four NSC meetings that led up to the decision to take action in Syria. The last one came at about 4:00 o'clock at Mar-a-Lago. That's when Rex Tillerson, H.R. McMaster, and James Mattis, defense secretary, sat down with the president and said, OK, we've answered all of the -- we've got the answers to all the questions that you want have to have answered because the president apparently had a lot of questions in the run-up to all of this. They said, Here's three options. We weren't told what the other two options were, but one of them we believe was do nothing. We don't know what the other one was, or we can hit this base. And so the president made the decision at about 4:00 o'clock. Then he went into his meetings with Xi Jinping. And the two of them were having dinner there at Mar-a-Lago as the missiles were in the air.  And just after the president got confirmation, Sean, that those missiles had begun hitting their targets at that airbase, he turned to Xi Jinping and said, I just want to let you know we've taken military action against Syria. Here are the reasons why. And according to the White House, Xi Jinping at least indicated to understand what the president was doing, though in an official statement from the Chinese foreign ministry, China has said that they're urging peace on all sides and to try to not provoke anything that would increase tension in the region -- Sean.",1,1473.0,268.0,guest,4.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07
4,HANNITY," Understood. All right, John, interesting back story. I know you worked a lot of long hours. Thank you for your great coverage.

Catherine, That's what the latest?",1,335.0,57.0,host,5.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07
5,"CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX CORRESPONDENT"," Well, Sean, military intelligence is investigating whether Russia had a role in the chemical weapons attack and tried to destroy evidence with a second air strike to cover up the crime. A drone belonging to either Syria or Russia was seen over the rebel-held town after the sarin gas attack Tuesday. It returned later that day, this time at the hospital where the victims were being treated, and a short time after that, the hospital was bombed. Based on this Defense Department document released today, there is no doubt Syrian government jets carried out the chemical attack. The red dots there on the right track, their flight path showing the jets were over the town twice in a nine-minute period when the sarin gas was unleashed.  Another reason the plan came together quickly and seamlessly -- the U.S. has target plans on the shelf for Syria's six main airbases. These plans were developed a few years ago so that President Obama could deliver on his red line pledge. Today, a senior administration official said the punishing air strikes may not be over.",1,1063.0,184.0,guest,6.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07

10,HANNITY," All right, Catherine, when we talk about these air strikes, from what I heard, all 59 Tomahawk missiles -- and remember, they're 18 feet long, 1,000 pounds of ammunition, two feet wide from a range of about what, 600 miles in some cases pinpoint accuracy, all hit their targets.",1,279.0,50.0,host,9.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07
11,HERRIDGE," That's right, extremely accurate. And just to emphasize for people at home, we have such good intelligence about these airbases. It's so granular in nature, we know exactly where the jets are, where the helicopters are, the maintenance facilities. And it was from these intelligence streams that we knew they had chemical weapons stored at that base. So in many respects, the clock was already ticking for the Syrian president, and we were waiting for him to make a mistake, Sean.",1,481.0,82.0,guest,10.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07

19,"LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX PRODUCER"," Well, hey, Sean. Here's what we know. Just hours after those two U.S. Navy destroyers fired 60 Tomahawk cruise missiles into Syria, the Pentagon noticed that a Russian warship armed with (INAUDIBLE) caliber (ph) cruise missiles had gone from the Black Sea through the Bosphorus straight into the Aegean sea. That happened this morning.  The Russian frigate Admiral Grigorovich is expected to enter the eastern Mediterranean this evening. U.S. defense officials tell me the Russian warship is heading toward the USS Ross and Porter (INAUDIBLE) the two destroyers that conducted the Syrian strike. The Navy has been watching the ship, monitoring its movements. Russian state media said today this is a routine transit to the Syrian port of Tardis, which Russia leases. Just yesterday, there were no Russian warships in the eastern Mediterranean, Sean. We asked this question when it became obvious the U.S. Navy was preparing a missile strike.  Now the eastern Mediterranean is a little more crowded. Now, Sean, these two guided missile destroyers can hold 70 Tomahawk cruise missiles. I'm told just a short time ago, one of those destroyers is presently steaming to an undisclosed location in the Mediterranean to rearm -- Sean.",1,1228.0,200.0,guest,18.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07

I thought this strike ordered by the president was very measured, very precise, had a very limited rationale because of the use of chemical weapons, but very effective. And I think the message that it sent around the world to adversaries, potential adversaries, China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, well beyond Syria, something that needed to be heard, and I think it's going to change a lot of calculations. I don't think you can underestimate the reverberations that we're going to see from this.",1,568.0,96.0,guest,20.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07

What do you make of -- I mean, in your capacity as a former U.N. ambassador, here's the president of the United States. He's having dinner with the premier of China and has to lean over probably during dessert and say, By the way, I probably need to give you a head-up, I just launched a 59 Tomahawk missiles at Syria because they killed innocent men, women and children with chemical weapons.

23,BOLTON," Well, it's enormously important because we know that North Korea's nuclear weapons program was right at the top of the agenda in their bilateral meetings. And what Trump basically said is when a country like Syria undertakes solemn commitments in the chemical weapons convention and the famous John Kerry deal that we thought eliminated or at least the Obama administration thought eliminated Syria's chemical weapons -- when countries violate those commitments, there are going to be consequences. So when Donald Trump raises the North Korean nuclear weapons program today, Xi Jinping knows that unlike the last eight years, he's talking to somebody who's prepared to take action--",1,683.0,108.0,guest,22.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07

They were wrong. They were dead wrong. We saw the impact this past Tuesday, dead children lying in the street and many others suffering and bleeding and dying! Now, my question is this. What if Obama and Kerry and Susan Rice were as wrong on Iran and the deal that they made and their capacity to make nuclear weapons as they were in Syria and Bashar al Assad and getting rid of chemical weapons?",1,633.0,118.0,host,25.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07

They were sure of it, just like they're sure that Iran has stopped its efforts toward deliverable nuclear weapons, just as they could cut a deal with North Korea. This is the kind of lesson I think for the new Trump administration. When you sit down across the table with the Russians, with the Iranians, the North Koreans, they may agree with what you want.

30,HANNITY," All right, let me -- last question, Ambassador, because we have this very public posture by Russia, and then we saw Russia pull back a little bit earlier this week when they said their support for Syria was not unconditional. Many ways, it seems like they're doing a little saber- rattling, but behind the scenes, they do not want to take on this issue of Syria and the United States. Didn't they have the capacity to put up their missile defense system last night and they didn't do it at this very air force base?",1,516.0,96.0,host,29.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07

They're not concerned with the humanitarian aspect, but they know now they've got a problem. The principal Russian interest here is protecting their naval base at Tardis, their airbase at Latakiyah.  You know, I think they'll stick with Assad as long as they can. And they would only replace him with somebody who would allow them to stay there.

In other words, the United States of America is back, and that is tonight's ""Opening Monologue."" All right, so in response to the Syrian government using chemical weapons against innocent men, women and children last night, well, President Trump ordered the launch of Tomahawk cruise missiles to destroy the airbase where this attack was carried out from. Now, in doing so, the commander-in-chief is sending a resounding message to you, the American people, and the entire world, America is back. Syria, North Korea, Iran, Russia, China and the rest of the entire world saw a very different United States of America last night. Instead of weakness, we now have strength. Instead of appeasement, capitulation, we now have decisiveness and leadership. Timidity has been replaced by bold action. Now, this is a far different cry from that of the Obama administration. You want to see how profound this difference is? Just take a look at Syria. Remember back in 2012 when then president Obama -- remember? He drew the red line in the sand with Syrian President Ashar al Bassad (sic), and this is what he said way back then. Take a look.",2,1353.0,230.0,host,41.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07

55,HANNITY," President Obama, John Kerry, Susan Rice all said the same thing, Assad had gotten rid of all his chemical weapons. But guess what? They were all dead wrong! Now, unlike his predecessor, President Trump -- he acted swiftly, decisively to stop the Syrian regime from using chemical weapons ever again.  And by the way, here's our final thought. The Obama administration -- remember the horrible deal they made with Iran? They claimed that, in fact, it'll prevent the rogue regime in Tehran, the mullahs of Tehran, from developing a nuclear weapon. Here's a question to ponder. What if they're wrong about that, like they were wrong about Syria and Assad getting rid of their chemical weapons? Joining us now with reaction, conservative commentator, our friend, Monica Crowley, former spokesman for the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Ric Grenell.  Ric, let's just ponder that question for a second. What if they told the world that they drew a red line and they didn't act because Assad got rid of his chemical weapons? What we saw on Tuesday -- they didn't get rid of their chemical weapons. What if the deal they made with Iran that they say will prevent them from getting nuclear weapons -- well, let's say they're wrong there, too, which would not surprise me.",2,1259.0,219.0,host,47.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07

OK, well, we know the Iranian deal is this bad that we have billions of dollars that we transferred so they can continue spinning those centrifuges.

That's when he made his statement that this crossed many, many red lines.  And add to that meeting the crown prince, a reset of the relationship with Prime Minister Netanyahu, and this emerging alliance against Iranian hegemony in the region, they're -- this is a very different world order emerging, where it seems to be the North Koreans, the Iranians, the Syrians and Russia isolated from the rest of the world!",2,689.0,121.0,host,55.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07

The U.S. Navy, they launched 60 tomahawk missiles, 59 of the 60 hit the target with only one landing in the sea. The tomahawk missile is a very effective choice for a strike like what we saw last night. It is a precise weapon. It can be fired up to 1,000 miles away.  Joining is now with more is the host of ""War Stories,"" our friend Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North. Colonel, we have the images, 59 out of 60 targets, pinpoint accuracy, all missing on purpose the chemical weapons that were stored at that air base.

79,"LT. COL. OLIVER NORTH, FOX NEWS HOST"," Let's start with the idea that if you want to send a message you can send flowers, but if you want to send a message that matters, send cruise missiles, and that's exactly what the president did.  The good news about all this is no U.S. casualties. I remember well what happened when we did this to Muammar Qaddafi back in the 1980s and President Reagan launched. We didn't have this kinds of missiles in the quantities that we now have them. And we launched an F-111 with two airmen. That didn't happen last night. The targets that were struck were all pinpointed well before they were launched. The GPS coordinates were plugged into them, and those missiles were ripple fired so that there was about a four minute span between the time the first missile hit and the last missile hit. And as you pointed out, one missile misfired and went into the sea.  The bottom line of this is that Vladimir Putin now knows that if he wants his stooge Bashar al-Assad to stay alive he ought to get him out of Damascus and make him Eddie Snowden's roommate in Moscow. They deserve each other.",3,1080.0,200.0,guest,66.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07
80,HANNITY," Colonel, when you look at the accuracy here, they've got 1,000 pounds of munitions, each and every tomahawk missiles 18 feet long, two feet wide, flying at low altitudes, 600-mile attack here, and 59, they took out 20 aircraft in this attack. It is almost precision perfect. ",3,276.0,49.0,host,67.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07
81,NORTH," It was. And Sean, one of the things that's important because there's a lot of back chatter right now about whether this was a legitimate target. Shayrat airfield was a legitimate target. It's all military, it's over revetments, aircraft, ground support equipment, a fuel farm, air traffic control radars, and Syrian aircraft, as you pointed out. The bottom line of it was this was a proportional attack in a vital national interest of the U.S., an effort to deter the Syrians or in fact others from doing this kind of chemical attack again. And that means it was not only legal and it was not unconstitutional, it was the right thing to do and the right time to do it. ",3,670.0,122.0,guest,68.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07

83,NORTH," I think the collateral damage or the unintended consequences as one of our sister, I guess they're not even relatives, but another network is now talking about, it appears to be the only unintended consequences is limited to the small handful of Trump bashers in Congress. Shamefully one of them is U.S. senator from Virginia, Tim Kaine. He ought to have known better.  There's very positive consequences of this. The Moscow, Tehran, Damascus troika of terror is coming to a close. It's going to get unraveled. And other than Pyongyang, Vladimir Putin doesn't have any friends that matter.

The United States will not stand by when chemical weapons are used. It is in our vital national security interest to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons.

99,HANNITY," That was the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley earlier today saying the U.S. is prepared to do more in Syria if necessary. After the government of course used chemical weapons against men, women, and innocent children in the wake of last night's military operation, Sara Carter is reporting, quote, ""After the U.S. missile strike directly on Syria on Thursday night, U.S. officials confirmed to Circa News that intelligence agencies are watching closely for a possible retaliatory strike by the Lebanon based Hezbollah against U.S. interests overseas.""  Sara Carter with Circa News joins us now, as well as the author of ""Besieged,"" retired Brigadier General Tony Tata. Let's start, Sara, with you. Of course whenever military action is used you have got to contemplate what the potential consequences are. But I've got to believe Hezbollah, if they are going work against the United States in their interests, they too know what strike would be coming their way.

I just got off the line with some Free Syrian Army contacts, and I asked him the same questions that I posed to U.S. intelligence today, and they said, yes, they are very emboldened by what happened, the Free Syrian Army is. They are very emboldened, and they have a lot of respect for President Trump.  But they did say there is a concern on the ground and they are monitoring it very closely that Iran could use Hezbollah to launch a retaliatory type of strike in an attempt to try to embarrass President Trump or try to redirect his push against Bashar al-Assad. So this is very significant. It's something we really have to keep an eye out for. I think the U.S. military as well as U.S. intelligence, and that also includes Iraqi military, they're going to keep a very close eye on this as well, Sean. ",4,819.0,153.0,guest,82.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07
101,HANNITY," Sara, I think what Colonel North is saying is also true, and that is he calls it the troika of Moscow and Damascus and Tehran, that they are very isolated now in the world. We know Iran has been fighting all these proxy wars using groups like Hezbollah and others. But there is the new emerging alliance of the Jordanians, Egyptians, the Saudis and the Israelis to prevent Iranian hegemony in the region, whatever alliance they might have with Russia or Syria and Assad, right? ",4,479.0,87.0,host,83.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07
102,CARTER," Yes, absolutely. And that's the push to try to stop this Shia crescent that was evolving over the last eight years. They really felt emboldened, the Iranians, the Russians, Bashar al-Assad. I mean, they were conducting chemical weapons attacks. We know based on evidence that those chemical weapons were not dispersed or not pushed out of Syria. We know that they are still there.  And there's a lot of other significant steps that the United States could take. I mean, if Bashar al-Assad continues. If the Russians continue to push, there are other airbases there that don't have Russian presence that they could take out. There is Hamas airfield and there's also Dumar (ph) airfield which a strategical, that could be something that we see in the future. ",4,758.0,131.0,guest,84.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-07

104,"BRIGADIER GENERAL TONY TATA, (RET) ""BESIEGED"" AUTHOR"," Yes, roger that, Sean. We've got to the greatest fighting force in the world, but what we have to really take a look at is President Obama's ignorance of the Iran deal. Within a year of the Iran deal, Hezbollah has now 20,000 active-duty fighters, 25,000 reserve fighters, 160,000 new missiles, and they are weaponizing unmanned aerial vehicles with biological and chemical weapons.  This is a very real threat that is funded by President Obama's Iranian deal. And so I was glad to see Ambassador Haley actually exert leadership on behalf of President Trump so that these collective security arrangements are only as strong as their primary leader. And to get all the laggards moving forward, Ambassador Haley is actually exerting leadership on behalf of the United States to try to do something because our vital interests are threatened. Obama should have read his own national security strategy were a world order based on the rule of law and eliminating chemical weapons are part of that strategy.

Jay, we know this is going to come for the first time in a couple of hundred years.

Don't forget, of course, that he's the one who changed Senate precedent so that you only needed 51 votes for cabinet picks in order to help Barack Obama. Now that has been an aide to Donald Trump as president. And then Chuck Schumer busted the door wider open, you're right, with this unprecedented filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee.

But first, the Trump administration kicks off a very important week on foreign policy. Russia and Iran are both warning the United States that after last week's Tomahawk missile strike in Syria and after calling out the Russians over the Syria chemical weapons attack, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson gets ready to head to Moscow in what is shaping up to be a major showdown. Plus, in response to North Korea and their aggression, the U.S. Navy has sent a strike group to the region to show major force on our part.

1,"BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT"," Sean, among the Syrians we've spoken to here, there is an overwhelming sense of gratitude both towards President Trump and the U.S. administration. But it is always tinged with a sense that maybe not enough has been done, and they point to the fact that Syrian jets have continued to bomb the very town that was gassed just last week.  Over the weekend, the Russians release video of the Shattayat (ph) airbase which was hit by the Tomahawks as if it were back in order. But today, Sean Spicer said that was merely a stunt and that 20 percent of the Syrian air force had, in fact, been destroyed.  Fox News has also spoken to survivors of the chemical attack, reunited with surviving family members.

5,HALL," The Tomahawk strikes, though, made Iran and Russia very angry. They do not want to see another sheriff on the block. And President Rouhani of Iran said any more strikes like this would be considered a red line for them, and next time, they would retaliate. Meanwhile, images today emerged of the 75th Ranger regiment deployed in northern Syria, a spokesperson for the U.S.-led coalition saying that they were sent there to deter any possible new aggression and ensure that all parties remain focused on delivering that lasting defeat to ISIS. And certainly, President Assad and his allies, Russia and Iran, are posturing. They're pretending that nothing has changed here, but nothing everything has changed. And Trump's actions have meant that the very tempo of this conflict on the ground is different.

11,EDSON," The White House says if it see that type of attack in Syria again, it holds open the possibility of further U.S. action, this as the Russian government in turn is condemning the United States for the attack last week on Syria, calling it a violation of international law. In a teleconference this morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, quote, ""The U.S. side thus has demonstrated a complete reluctance to somehow cooperate on Syria and take into account each other's interests and concerns."" The Russian government says it could partner with the United States to fight terrorism, though (ph) said the United States is diminishing those chances with anti-Russian rhetoric coming out of Washington.

13,"JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT"," Sean, we're told the USS Carl Vinson will not be near Korea before April 24th. The president ordered the aircraft carrier group to reverse course and head to South Korea after meeting the Chinese president, but it's not clear that this show of force has any real teeth behind it.  On board the USS Carl Vinson are fighter jets, but they would pose little threat to North Korea's air defense systems. Remember, the U.S. has 33,000 American troops in South Korea, and North Korea has artillery trained on U.S. positions and South Korea's capital with its population of 25 million people. They are all within easy striking distance of North Korean missiles. The USS Navy cruiser and Navy destroyers traveling with the Vinson are capable of launching Tomahawk cruise missiles similar to the ones fired into Syria last week. Those could easily strike North Korea's ballistic missile launch pads, or take out the sites associated with Kim Jong-un's nuclear program. But the question is, what would come next. Military experts tell me this is not Syria. The White House is concerned that Kim Jong-un plans more missile tests to coincide with the upcoming anniversaries marking the birthday of his grandfather and the founding of the communist state's army, April 15th and 25th respectively. The Pentagon also sees signs the rogue communist regime is preparing another nuclear test. It carried out two just last year. It's important to remember, Sean, that the U.S. Navy always has one boomer (ph) or ballistic missile submarine on alert in the western Pacific. There is a great concern -- a deal of concern here at the Pentagon that North Korea may soon have a intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the U.S., Sean.",1,1722.0,290.0,guest,10.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-10
14,HANNITY," All right, pretty scary. A lot going on in the world. Jennifer, thank you, as always.  And joining us now with reaction, author of the best-selling book, ""Treason,"" former speaker of the House, FOX News contributor Newt Gingrich.  All right, Mr. Speaker, so how does Donald Trump now respond to the saber- rattling, Rouhani saying this is their red line in Iran and Russia now actually going as far as to say that -- and warning President Trump if he hits Syria again, that this -- where -- we are one step away from war. What should the response be from the Trump administration?",1,581.0,107.0,host,11.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-10
15,"NEWT GINGRICH, R-FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," Well, I think the response is pretty straightforward. If this happens again, we're going to hit them again. If you want to get in the way, then get in the way. But if you look at any correlation of forces in the area, the Russians can't possibly sustain their naval power and their air power in Syria and in the eastern Mediterranean area against the United States. It would be an absurdity, and Putin would end up being humiliated. Now, he could then escalate above that, but you know, we went through the entire cold war with saber-rattling but not firing on each other. And I don't think they're going to fire on us now.  The fact is, we have crossed the line. The president crossed this line. We are not going to tolerate Assad continuing to use chemical weapons. If Assad doesn't use chemical weapons, my guess is everything will calm down. If he does use chemical weapons, I think we're going to hit him again. And if the Russians get in the way, they're just going to get hit as part of the process.  As for the Iranians, they are listed every single year by the State Department as the leading sponsor of terrorism in the world. So what's new? They say ""Death to America."" They mean ""Death to America."" You know, at some point down the road, they may try to do something. But again, they would run a much bigger risk of massive American retaliation than their capacity to inflict harm on us.",1,1400.0,260.0,guest,12.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-10
16,HANNITY," All right, let me move then to a more unstable leader in the case of North Korea. And I mean, really unstable, as we've reported in the past. But that instability means he's unpredictable in some sense. So with America now showing some use of force, China now showing some involvement in the region, what do you suspect is going on there? And will the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un -- is he going to do anything that we need to respond to?",1,445.0,85.0,host,13.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-10
17,GINGRICH," Well, first of all, remember the last report. If we have a Trident submarine somewhere in the western Pacific, that has probably at least 48 nuclear weapons on it. So the capacity to eliminate North Korea is pretty real. That would be horrible, and it's certainly not something we want to do or are going to do, but in terms of a real deterrent, that submarine is a much bigger deterrent than the aircraft carrier.  What the aircraft carrier does is it signals visibly to all of our allies in the region who see it on TV and it says, Hey, the United States is here. We're not backing down. We're not going to desert you. But if you look at Seoul, 25 million people, all of them living with range of North Korean artillery, you really don't want to end up in a situation where Kim Jong-un goes crazy. I think the Chinese are going to apply pressure to him. We're going to apply pressure to him. I think, frankly, the best result in both North Korea and in Syria is to somehow get the military to replace the dictator. In both cases, you'd have a more stable and more rational government. But this is very, very risky stuff because the world really is risky.",1,1157.0,218.0,guest,14.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-10
18,HANNITY," Well, the world is an evil place and we have evil dictators. But it seems to be a Damascus, a Tehran problem, a Moscow problem. And then separate and apart, we have North Korea. All right, we had been assured by John Kerry, then secretary of state -- we had assurances from the president, assurances from Susan Rice that there were no more chemical weapons, and that Barack Obama's red line in the sand made them get rid of all of them.

25,GINGRICH," Well, let me -- let me start and distinguish the two.

Now, I'd I love the conversation in Moscow, where he asked them, you know, Were you duped because you're incompetent, or in fact, were you were complicit here? There's not a third answer here.  But the three people you described -- you know, there's an essay that's on Google -- people who are watching us can go and pull it up -- by Nasim Taleb (ph), who wrote ""The Black Swan."" It's called ""Intellectual yet idiot."" That portrait that you just painted, those three people -- I have never seen a clearer statement of intellectuals yet idiots. These people had big words. They went to fancy schools. They supposedly knew a lot. They're very articulate. They are totally out of touch with reality, and you now have such vivid proof.  Of course the Iranian deal is bad. These folks -- none of these people are in any way in touch with the real world. They live in a fantasy world and they're surrounded by a news media which protects them and Hollywood stars who protect them and people who make a living playing out lay fantasies on the screen get with them and tell them how wonderful they are for their political fantasies. And then they go see fantasy professors who tell them how terrific their policies are.  This stuff is all a perfect example of what Taleb meant when he wrote ""Intellectual yet idiot,"" which I recommend highly to our entire audience.",1,1571.0,285.0,guest,20.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-10

36,HANNITY," President Trump kept his word, he put an originalist on the U.S. Supreme Court to replace Justice Antonin Scalia. Now, what the mainstream media will not tell you and what Trump's will never admit, that this is just one of the presidents many accomplishments. Let's take a look at the list. Now, the president is busy brining back jobs, making phone calls to companies day and night. He's gutting Obama-era regulations, and the president has said he could eliminate up to 75 percent of government rules and regulations. Bye-bye! Now, the president has also ended the war on coal by repealing red tape from the Obama administration.  He's reduced illegal immigration, border crossing has plummeted since he became president and took the oath of office.  Now, the White House is fighting back against sanctuary cities. The president is taking a tough stance against places that shield illegal immigrants.  He's drafted a plan to defeat ISIS.  The president has also imposed a five-year lobbying ban to drain the swamp.  The Trump administration sanctioned Iran over the missile program and put the rogue regime on notice.  He's responded to Syria's use of chemical weapons by approving a Tomahawk missile strike.  President Trump created a task force to reduce crimes. He signed executive orders to protect police officers. He signed executive orders to target drug cartels.  Now, while the president is enacting his agenda every single day, now, there's still plenty of work do and things to be done, but we'll put those things on the side of the screen.  Failing to repeal and replace ObamaCare, that was a big misstep. Republicans need to learn from their mistake here. Now, we've said repeatedly on this program the GOP leadership in Congress should have built consensus, they should've passed around the bill before they introduced it. And there is good news, though. The health care bill is not dead. Republicans are moving ahead on a massive tax reform plan.  But it is so critically important that they get all sides involved from the beginning behind closed doors, come up with plans to get bills that will pass. Now, the Republican leadership needs to come together, pass the president's budget so we can reduce spending, shrink government, rebuild the military, and get all of these things done so Americans get back to work. And there's the issue of the alt-left propaganda destroy Trump media, breathlessly, daily reporting on infighting in the White House and their staff. Now, who knows whether or not the press has blown that out of proportion like everything they cover, but the reality is, to me, it's irrelevant. Whoever President Trump wants to have around him, he's going to have around him. Their job, if you work for the president, is to put his agenda in place, serve him, serve the country, do your job.  But the bottom line is this. There are many people and factions that want to see this president fail. Now, he's right on the right track at this time, and all he has to do to succeed to be popular and to win over votes in the coming elections is to keep his promises to you, the American people. And the people that will help him do that are the ones that should be around him.  Joining us now with reaction, former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. To me, it's simple. Keep your promises. He has a pretty long list in a fairly short period of time that he's checked off. I am disappointed that after eight years of saying ""repeal and replace,"" they didn't have a bill ready that had consensus. I think they'll get it done, but they made it harder than they should have.",2,3601.0,635.0,host,26.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-10
37,GINGRICH," Sure. But let's put a couple of things here that you touched on. I think the swearing in of Justice Gorsuch today -- it's a huge victory for conservatism, big victory for the president. And if you think back to what the alternative would have been with Hillary Clinton, what an enormous difference. If you want a reminder of how big a difference the election made, imagine who she would've been swearing in and how radical that person would have been.  But second, let's be fair. Mitch McConnell really deserves a lot of credit. While the House Republicans were floundering, he very aggressively, very calmly said over and over again, Judge Gorsuch is going to become Justice Gorsuch. I will figure out a way to get this done. It is going to happen. He changed history. It was a very courageous thing to do. It was the right thing to do.

Today, The Washington Post gave Rice four Pinocchios over that claim, and yesterday former deputy secretary of state Anthony J. Blinken who served with Rice in the Obama administration contradicted his former colleague, telling ""The New York Times,"" quote, ""We always knew we had not gotten rid of everything, that the Syrians had not been fully forthcoming in the declaration.""

Look, let me just get the telescope back just a little bit and take a look at what this president, President Trump inherited from the Obama administration in terms of national security and foreign policy. Whether it was the rolling disaster that still is ongoing in Libya, the phony red line in the sand after Assad used sarin gas the first time, or whether it's the hidden stores of sarin gas that turned up to be used again last week, or that were supposedly destroyed, the Russians were working with us on.  Or think about this in terms of an existential threat, the Iranian-North Korean nuke weapons ICBM joint venture that now has I think the world, correctly, concerned. And all of those have been lies from the previous administration, Sean. This is a pattern behavior. It goes well beyond just one woman.

How is that working out for you? Think about what this president has to deal with. And on top of it, all the other things that are happening around him, the difficulty he's having getting people confirmed for positions. I went back and I looked. By the time the Reagan administration had been in office 78 days, they had all but a handful of positions completely filled that required some kind of confirmation. The Congress of the United States, the Senate of the United States, just a minority of it, has been slow rolling this whole thing.  I am glad that Neil Gorsuch is going to be the justice of the Supreme Court. But there are dozens of positions that have to be filled that are important to the national security of this country.

These are weapons decided to kill, barrels filled with explosives, shrapnel, oil and nails dropped on town squares and hospitals. They are devastating. They have killed tens of thousands of people. And if Assad wanted to find a better way of antagonizing the U.S. on this day, he couldn't have found one.

But when you drop gas or bombs or barrel bombs -- they have these massive barrels with dynamite, and they drop them right in the middle of a group of people -- and in all fairness, you see the same kids, no arms, legs, no face. This is an animal.  I will tell you that when I looked at the pictures, especially when you see them on television, and you see these beautiful kids that are dead in their father's arms or you see kids gasping for life and you know it's over -- it's over for them. They're hosing them down -- hundreds of them -- when you see that -- I immediately called General Mattis. I said, What can we do? And they came back with a number of different alternatives. And we hit them very hard. Now, are we going to get involved with Syria? No. But if I see them using gas and using things that -- I mean, even some of the worst tyrants in the world didn't use the kind of gases that they used. And some of the gases are unbelievably potent. So when I saw that, I said we have to do something.",1,1180.0,237.0,guest,19.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-11

27,HANNITY," All right, Maria, obviously the president was very emotionally moved by those images. But also, if you paid close attention to his campaign rhetoric, he wants to fight terror, he doesn't want occupation and he didn't want troops on the ground. He seemed to reiterate all of that to you in that interview.  Give us some more background and color as to what he was also saying.",1,376.0,69.0,host,20.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-11
28,BARTIROMO," Well, you know, president Trump knows exactly who the evil actors are in the world. I was very impressed in terms of his knowledge of what's happening in that part of the world and who is behind it. Look, the truth is, is that many generals, and you know, military people out there know that former secretary John Kerry did advocate doing something, limited military action in Syria. But President Obama time and time again rejected it. He did not want to do any military strike in Syria.  President Trump saw those pictures, saw what was really happening on the ground and moved. And that's why he had broad support all around the world for those moves. I will say this. The sound bite that you just ran, when he said, Look, this is an evil man and Russia is backing an evil person -- that was in response to my question to the president asking him if, in fact, our relationship, the U.S. relations with Russia has been damaged by this move. He said, I don't know. But I will say this, this is an evil man and Russia is backing an evil person. So I would say to you, as Rex Tillerson meets with Mr. Lavrov tomorrow in Russia, he has more leverage. He goes into that meeting with more leverage because the world agrees with President Trump in terms of what he just did. He made it very clear he does not want to get in some long-term entanglement in Syria. Having said that, he is going to take an action, make a move when he sees this done on humanity. So that's where he stands. He would not commit to, you know, what happens next. And we know that because he's never going to tell you exactly where -- what he's thinking and -- and -- and you know, put the plans out there on the table.  But he definitely felt strongly in terms of this was something that he needed to act, the U.S. needed to be up front on.",1,1812.0,348.0,guest,21.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-11

But he's got our Navy ships right there so that North Korea understands we are here, we are ready, and we are not going to sit back if, in fact, there are atrocities committed. So that's the bottom line! And I think it's so interesting that he launches those military strikes while he's with the president of China.

127,HANNITY," That was the attorney general Jeff Sessions earlier today in Arizona where he toured the U.S.-Mexico border and ushered in a new era of border security and law enforcement. The Trump administration has had a tough job ahead of them. According to Pew Research and their center, half of all 2014 federal arrests were for immigration related offenses.  Joining us now with details on the administration's plan to enforce the border is Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Attorney General, I've been down to the border probably about 12 or 14 times. I've been there when criminals are arrested, I've been drug warehouses, helicopter, horseback, boats, all-terrain vehicles. I've seen it up close. I've seen tunnels dug up from Mexico to San Diego. What exactly is going to change, and how quickly will it change? ",3,806.0,136.0,host,101.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-11
128,"JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL"," It's already changing. Can you believe that we've had the lowest number of entrants at the border in 17 years? This is a direct result of Donald Trump's strong, clear leadership. It has an impact. The most important thing for us is to send a message to the world that the border is not open. Please don't come. You will be apprehended if you do come, and you will be deported promptly. If you're a criminal, you will be prosecuted. If you assault our officers we're going to come at you with a ton of bricks. This is the kind of message we need to send. It's already being sent. It's having a dramatic impact so far. I knew strong presidential leadership, unlike the wishy-washiness we've seen in the past would impact the flow, but not as much as we've seen already. The numbers are down 70 percent since President Obama left office. It's a really remarkable achievement. ",3,874.0,160.0,guest,102.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-11

",3,296.0,57.0,host,103.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-11
130,SESSIONS," I know he's going to battle for that and I believe he will get funding for the wall, I can't imagine Congress to deny him that. It doesn't have to be every foot of the entire 1,700 border, we know that. But a wall, a barrier multiplies the ability of our border patrol and customs officers to be effective. They tell me that and I know they've told you that in the past. ",3,372.0,75.0,guest,104.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-11

132,SESSIONS," So this is the way to go. If we follow through on this, we can secure this border. It will be a historic thing and is something that the border patrol and our ICE officers and our customs people are really excited about. You remember, they were so frustrated they eve even sued Obama leadership and endorsed Donald Trump in this election. I think their morale is up and I think that's a part of our success, too.

134,SESSIONS," We're going to go after the sanctuary cities first and foremost. We're going to urge them to protect the safety of the people in their cities. Do not release dangerous criminals into the community when the law says they are to be deported. And there are a lot of things that we can do that will help protect safety in this country. And we are going to stay at it. We are going to back up our law enforcement officers. We are going to prosecute those who assaulted them. We're going to prosecute the people they catch in court, and we are going to send a message that the criminality is over. ",3,593.0,114.0,guest,108.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-11

And when ""The Washington Post"" and ""The New York Times"" both have to admit that this has become something of a pattern with her, and specifically as it relates to Syria, you know it's now gotten to be a bit much.  You do wonder at some point, Sean, why was there never -- why was there never any price to be paid for going out on those Sunday shows and telling untruths after untruth? The Obama administration never really held pretty much anyone to account. What did they fire, Van Jones. That was pretty much the only person they ever fired. They reassigned other people in the State Department.  But Susan Rice always had a get out of investigation, get out of jail, get out of accountability card.

And that was part of his outgoing memo to the president. In April of 2016 it had been written about that it wasn't all that clear that they had been able to remove these stockpiles. Even on the facts as they are publicly reported, Susan Rice either just isn't paying attention or doesn't care about the truth. On the other stuff we know she just decided to take one for the team.

158,HANNITY," Welcome back to ""Hannity."" It is now the viral video causing outrage all around the world. A man bumped from an overbooked United Airlines flight was forcibly pulled from his seat and dragged right down the aisle by security officials after he refused to leave the plane and his assigned seat.  After nearly two days of widespread ridicule and noticeable decline in United stock, earlier in the day the company's CEO finally issued an apology, writing in part, quote, ""I deeply apologize to the customer forcibly removed and to all the customers aboard. No one should ever be mistreated this way.""  Joining is now with reaction, Salem nationally syndicated radio host Larry Elder, Fox News contributor Mercedes Schlapp. This is the dumbest thing, this is so dumb. Listen, so they offered another ticket, a free ticket. If you have no takers, then you go four tickets. You go eight tickets, eight tickets and a four-star hotel, eight tickets a four-star hotel and $5,000 pending. Now they're going to have to pay millions, Larry, because this guy is going to sue the pants off them, and their stock is in the tank. How could you be that dumb? That's what I'm trying to figure out. ",5,1181.0,208.0,host,124.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-11
159,"LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL SYNDICATED HOST"," Tell me about it. It is so easily solvable. All you have to do is jack up the goodies to get the four people off the plan. And by the way, what I'm hearing, Sean, is that they weren't overbooked. They wanted to bump four people off to put four United personnel on who had to go to the next location. That's really what happened.  But in any case, this has been an absolute disaster. The stock is down one percent. The CEO apologizes and then sends a statement of support to the employees and then apologizes again. I'm sure they have a crisis consultant. Apparently they are not listening.

If you offer enough to get incentives to give people a reason to get off that flight, take another flight, you offer them seats to anywhere they want to travel, maybe pay for their hotel, maybe give them spending money, at some point I'm raising my hand and say I'll take that deal.

Let the price go to the market. At some point four individuals would have said, you know, I can see grandma tomorrow. I can make this trip a little bit later on. I don't have to be in tonight.

168,SCHLAPP," But Sean, United Airlines made several mistakes. One is you normally make those offers before the passengers board on the airplane.

Secretary Tillerson emerged from his meeting saying it is a low point between the U.S. and Russia on their relationship and there is a low level of trust between the two countries. They cannot even agree on fundamental facts. The Trump administration is arguing that it is Bashar al Assad, his regime in Syria, responsible for a chemical attack against its citizens there last week. Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister here, says that's not the case. He says he wants an investigation to figure out who is responsible. We asked Lavrov if that investigation comes back and says that Assad is responsible, what would his posture towards Russia be -- Russia to Syria be. He said he refuses to speculate.

And I think you know where I'm going with that. The president talking at length about the need for member nations to get on board, to pay their fair share. He also talked a great deal about Russia. He said it was probably unlikely that the Kremlin knew in advance of that deadly gas attack perpetrated on the Syrian people by the murderous dictator, Bashar al Assad.

First of all, he wants the members to pay what they owe to help build what NATO can be as a security bulwark again. The second thing is to keep in mind, even as NATO expands, adding Montenegro today, he doesn't want that to become the focus. He wants a relationship with Russia, albeit right now, it's certainly strained, especially when you consider not just what you heard today in Moscow, but also when you consider what happened in Syria and election meddling, just to name a couple of other issues.",1,656.0,120.0,guest,9.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12

It seems like, you know, the world is beginning to discover here there's no more bleeding from. Our relationships now been (ph) reestablished with countries in Europe, certainly with Israel. There won't be any more Iranian deals. And America is not going to wait and lead from behind.  I sense the world's having a tough adjustment.

14,"SARA CARTER, CIRCANEWS.COM"," Well, I agree with you there, Sean. And I think that there was a lot of misinformation, I mean, from the very beginning with regard to President Trump and Vladimir Putin. I mean, I remember the stories coming out showing President Trump and Vladimir Putin like they were buddy-buddies.  But I can tell you from the sources that I had, people that are Russian analysts, people that are very close to people in the Kremlin and in the United States, people who were advising both Trump and also Hillary Clinton. Vladimir Putin had no idea how President Trump was going to react. In fact, he was in a state of panic, they said. He would constantly contact the Russian ambassador, trying to figure out, How is President Trump going to react to our policies overseas in Syria? How is he going to react to our policies with Iran? So I think for -- for -- for so many people, there was such a misconception regarding President Trump and Vladimir Putin, and now we're seeing that what those analysts were telling me was right. I mean, I think it played out fully. They didn't expect President Trump to do what he did, and I think he made a very poignant and decisive decision. And it was a decision that is accepted throughout the world by most people. I know there's a controversy as to whether or not he should have gone to Congress, but it certainly made it -- he made a decision, and it was a decision that does not lead from behind but certainly from the front.",1,1458.0,270.0,guest,11.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
15,HANNITY," You know, certainly, if, you know, Rex Tillerson and the president are talking about Putin and Russia being complicit or incompetent, one or the other, it doesn't sound like the president is deeply compromised having colluded with the Russians to defeat Hillary Clinton that that would be something they would ever say as this bizarre conspiracy theory now, Jay, has been -- been -- you know, that narrative has gone on for eight months.",1,438.0,75.0,host,12.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
16,"JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE"," Yes. So the conspiracy theory is I just that. It's always been, in my view, a faux, a false narrative. And now you've got a decisive action coming out with the president the United States, and you compare that with eight years of leading from behind, as Sara said. But I think more importantly, and what I think is really having the impact here is the president is exercising the muscular power of the United States both in its diplomacy and in its military capabilities.  And they're not -- by the way, those are not two mutually opposites. I think you can be -- you know, Disraeli famously said that you could just -- diplomacy was a form of war. And what you're seeing right now is a diplomatic maneuver going on in Russia right now between Secretary Tillerson and the foreign minister of Russia, that is strong from the United States perspective.  The Russians are trying to figure out how they're going to deal with this. And what the president is trying to do -- and I think he's done a really, very, very good job here, a great job -- is he understands that there was a very dangerous nexus between Russia, Iran and Syria.  And the president, instead of just letting it mature so that you'd have this strong Russia with Iran on the role to a -- on the way to a nuclear armament basically -- without any question, that's where they were heading -- this president comes and says, You know what? We're not only hitting a pause, we are taking back our role as the leader. We are taking our role as the director of how these things are going to play out, and we're not going to allow the Russians to use proxies!",1,1615.0,304.0,guest,13.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12

18,CARTER," You would think, based on what those in opposition to the president have been saying. You would think that would definitely compromise him and he wouldn't have made this decision. This is certainly a decision that Vladimir Putin did not expect. And you know, Sean, for the last eight years, I mean, during the Syrian civil crisis and this civil war, there was so much confusion coming out of the Obama administration. I and tell you, talking to intelligence sources that were on the ground in Syria, on the ground in Iraq, they didn't know which way was up, and neither did people that belong to the Free Syrian Army. Nobody knew what was going on. Were we there to take out Assad? Were we there to go after Islamic State and ISIS and al Nusra and al Qaeda? What was the deal?

You're not going to be able to -- these governments are not going to be able to push around the United States and know that when there's a red line, we're just going to ignore it, as happened in Syria.

39,HANNITY," And welcome back to ""Hannity."" So after eight years of timid, weak and feckless leadership, America is now back on offense. And as a result, we're are seeing major adjustments from both our allies and our enemies. And that's tonight's Opening Monologue."" President Trump is now orchestrating a very profound and dramatic shift in how America leads on the world stage. It continued earlier today when the commander-in-chief held a joint news conference with NATO's secretary general while the president talked about member countries contributing their fair share of money to joint security, and he pushed for a stronger focus on the issue of terrorism. Also today, after the Trump administration has repeatedly condemned Russia over the Syria chemical weapons attack, well, the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, he was in Russia meeting with his foreign diplomatic counterpart and with Vladimir Putin. And in response to the growing threat of North Korea developing a nuclear weapon, well, the president has ordered what he is calling an armada to the region in a major show of force. Here's the bottom line tonight, It's very simple for the world to understand: There is a new sheriff in town, and the world is beginning to take notice. Now, I'm calling it the ""Trump Adjustment Syndrome,"" because after eight years of weakness and appeasement, well, the world is not used to seeing strength and the U.S. now is leading from the front and not from behind. And global leaders have grown accustomed to America not saying, for example, ""radical Islamic terrorism"" and America cutting deals with rogue nations, the number one state sponsor of terror like Iran, and the flat-out betrayal of one of our closest allies, Israel. Instead of taking a tough stance with Russia from the start, like what President Trump is now doing, the world was used to and saw Hillary Clinton offering to reset relations.

59,HANNITY," Barack Obama, he gave Russia space to operate. And guess what Vladimir Putin did? He took full advantage and ended up walking all over him. But now that President Trump has restored American leadership on the world stage, well, countries are having a hard time adjusting, and he's making guys like Putin, Kim Jong Un, Bashar al-Assad, radical mullahs in Iran, a little bit uneasy. Now, it's time for them to realize that the old ways of doing things is over.  Now, soon enough, they'll understand very clearly America's back and this landscape is now changed. And President Trump, he's also showing that in some cases, America has a moral obligation and duty to act in the world. That's why he responded to Syria's use of chemical weapons with a targeted and proportional military strike. Now, I know his actions in Syria is causing some saber-rattling and this criticism of what America's role in the world should be. But to those of you who disagree, let me ask you this question: Should America, the United States of America, sit on the sidelines while innocent men, women and children are gassed to death with chemical weapons? Should we really let what happened there, you know, keep going on? Or should we try and use America's might to stop evil in our time? Now, President Trump made the right decision. He drew a line in the sand with Syria and letting Assad know that the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated. So to the detractors out there, the commander-in-chief, he's made it clear: There will not be American boots on the ground -- that was a campaign promise -- in Syria or anywhere else for the time being.  Now, take a look at what he told our friend, Maria Bartiromo.",2,1695.0,303.0,host,46.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12

This is a seven-year civil war, we're not going to solve all those problems. But if America doesn't lead and take a moral stand, who will? Joining us now with reaction, the deputy assistant to the president Dr. Sebastian Gorka. You know, Dr. Gorka, I have friends of mine, very well- intentioned, and they are not happy that the president used force here. And I said to them, you know, if we allow Bashar al Assad to use chemical weapons against men, women and children, this could develop into a modern- day Holocaust.  I don't want boots on the ground. The president didn't put boots on the ground. I don't want an occupation. The president's not occupying. But he did draw a line and said, We cannot allow this moral boundary to be crossed. To me, that's the right thing to do. Your answer.",2,960.0,176.0,host,50.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
66,"SEBASTIAN GORKA, DEPUTY ASST. TO THE PRESIDENT"," You're absolutely right, Sean. This is one of those key instances where the moral imperative overlaps with the national security interests of the United States. We didn't ride in there just to do good. We rode in there because Susan Rice lied about the chemical weapons. Russia lied about the chemical weapons. They were used against women and children. If we allow that to happen again, it would be a blight upon values this nation has stood for since 1776. At the same time, Syria is where ISIS has established its caliphate, along with Iraq. We cannot permit these weapons to be used in that theater because sooner or later, somebody else could get hold of them. The president was explicit. We're not invading. This isn't 20 -- this isn't 2003. This isn't even 1991.

One of the most important sponsors is Moscow. Right now, I can tell you inside the Kremlin, they're making a very simple calculation. How much longer should we support Assad in Damascus because it may reach a point where it is no longer in Vladimir Putin's interests to do so.

But we know that the communist -- Chinese communist newspaper, their international paper, actually said there is a bottom line here as it relates to China's relationship with North Korea. They recently sent back coal that they'll now be importing from the United States. They're willing to talk about trade negotiations and adjustments. But I think the most important thing is the editorial in that -- in that the Chinese Communist Party paper actually said they will launch their own attacks on North Korea's nuclear facilities.

We're expected to believe that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin get together and they plan the mass murder of children to make some kind of point that there are no longer best buddies. Really?

119,MORGAN," I watched Chris Matthews talking about him being the Romanovs, the Trumps. He ended up by saying, not just comparisons to the Romanovs who were this royal family in Russia for 300 years. He said ""And we know how that ended."" I'll tell you how it ended. The Romanovs all got slaughtered at the start of what became the communist Soviet Union. They were slaughtered with guns and knives in a most brutal and disgusting matter. And whatever your view of the Romanovs, that's not really a comparison I don't think anyone in American media should be making about the Trump of family. What are we supposed to deduce from that comment? That somehow Jared, Ivanka, and Donald are all going to be murdered by communists? ",3,713.0,128.0,guest,96.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
120,HANNITY," They're attacking his 10-year-old son. They're attacking his wife, they are attacking Ivanka, they're going after women. To me it is just a new low.

121,MORGAN," I take issue. I'm not going to agree that journalism is dead, but journalism at the moment is going through a very strange phase in America where a lot of people are pinning their mast to a pure anti-Trump agenda. The guy won a free democratic election. There is right now absolutely zero evidence linking Donald Trump to any collusion with the Russians. ",3,356.0,65.0,guest,98.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12

138,HANNITY," That was President Trump during his interview with Maria Bartiromo where he addressed the ongoing crisis in Syria and slammed Vladimir Putin for his support of president Bashar al-Assad.   Joining us now, the host of ""Mornings with Maria"" on our sister network, the FOX Business Network, Maria Bartiromo, and Piers Morgan stays with us. Piers, said something, we all know the president, we've known him for years. And when you're with him, do you see the guy that I see, which is fun, smart, engaged, wanting to succeed? He does not like failing at all. He wants to win, he's serious about that. Is that what you see?",4,618.0,111.0,host,109.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
139,"MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK"," Absolutely. And I see real authenticity, and that's what people want. And that's what you want in the White House. You don't want a politician. So I think what he has been able to do in terms of being himself, bringing an authentic persona to the White House, has been very valuable, frankly. No, I agree with that. ",4,317.0,60.0,guest,110.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
140,HANNITY," I thought you got a lot of news out of him, especially on Syria, with all the conspiracy theories which we were talking about Russia, it's kind of interesting he's taken on Putin to such a high degree, and if Putin had the goods on him I doubt he would be doing it. ",4,267.0,55.0,host,111.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
141,BARTIROMO," For sure. I was saying in the commercial break, this whole narrative about Russia started at the Democratic National Convention because it was clear based on all of the emails that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was in the tank for Hillary Clinton, trying to take Bernie Sanders down. She gets pushed out. On day one of her conference, her convention, so what are they going to do? They completely changed the conversation. Don't look over here. Look over here. So they start creating this narrative about Russia, and they have just been riding it ever since. It's working for them. ",4,578.0,101.0,guest,112.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
142,MORGAN," It's a farcical thing at the moment, isn't it, where you've got Tillerson over there being as tough as he could possibly be with Vladimir Putin. You've got almost everybody around Trump being the same, and yet people are still trying to push a narrative that he's his poodle. This is not how poodles behave. I know people who have got pet poodles. They don't bite everybody. ",4,376.0,69.0,guest,113.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12

146,HANNITY," Talk about the authenticity, though, he doesn't hold back. He was with the secretary general of NATO today, and he was like you guys have got to pay more. And he said again, you guys have got to pay more. And I thought those were good things on his part.  But let me move forward to the Syria issue. I actually have friends of mine who are at odds with me. I think if you see moral depravity and evil in your time, I don't want America to be the world's policeman, I don't want an occupying force. But I do believe America should be using moral power and authority. ",4,567.0,113.0,host,117.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12

149,MORGAN," Well, I got issues about that. I think when we voted against taking air strikes Assad the first time after that red line was crossed. This all goes back to Obama. But really that showed America at the weakest I've seen America be perceived around the world in a very long time. Trump has restored a sense that America's military power will be wielded when it feels there is depravity, as you put it. ",4,401.0,76.0,guest,120.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
150,HANNITY," Do you agree with my monologue from earlier where I'm suggesting the world is going through a little adjustment period, not leading from behind, leading in front, America once again reestablishing its position in the world. ",4,225.0,38.0,host,121.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
151,BARTIROMO," Yes, 100 percent. Just the fact that he took this move tells everybody that the era leading from behind is over and the U.S. is a superpower and will in fact ask if they see, if the U.S. sees atrocities. The problem is, what happens next time? We're not expecting Assad not to use chemical weapons. ",4,300.0,58.0,guest,122.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12

157,MORGAN," I think he put a big warning sign right down there. He said to Assad, if you want to keep using sarin, this is what you are going to get, and it's going to get bigger and bigger if you keep doing this. That is I think the role of the United States.

171,TRUMP," We're going to have a much better plan than Obamacare, which is failing. Tax reform is going to be tough but it won't be as tough as health care. Health care is very, very difficult.  Health care is going to happen as some point. Now, if it doesn't happen fast enough, I'll start the taxes. But the tax reform and tax cuts are better if I can do health care first.  I'm going to build a wall 100 percent. In fact we have hundreds of bidders. We have many, many designs. I've seen ten of the top, but I want to see more. We are looking at designs and we're going to be making a decision very shortly. ",5,601.0,122.0,guest,138.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
172,,(END VIDEO CLIP),5,,,,,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
173,HANNITY," That was more of President Trump in his exclusive interview with Maria Bartiromo where he doubled down on this promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, tackle large-scale tax reform, and of course build a wall on our southern border.   On this show we have long promised to hold Washington accountable. Congress needs to step up, catch up to the speed of Trump and get something accomplished. It's infuriating.  We continue with the host of ""Mornings with Maria,"" host Maria Bartiromo. This was such a wide-ranging interview, a lot is contingent on health care first because there's $1 trillion in savings that goes right into the economic plan that he's going to lay out. That's a big deal, that's a big piece of that puzzle. ",5,728.0,129.0,host,139.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
174,BARTIROMO," It's a huge deal, Sean, because the truth is that President Obama put all of these taxes in the Affordable Care Act and raised $1 trillion. So President Trump wants to overturn that so he has $1 trillion to start with to begin to pay for the tax cuts. So that's why these two things are locked together.  The problem is some Republicans do not want to be feeling like they are playing hostage on tax reform to health care. Paul Ryan has been consumed with a health care act. Obviously they are knee-deep in this. We'll see. ",5,525.0,101.0,guest,140.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
175,HANNITY," My criticism is they didn't share the bill with leadership, didn't share the bill with anybody. They didn't build consensus. You've got moderates, you've got the study group, you've got the Tuesday group, the Saturday drinking group, you've the Freedom Caucus. I'm making up the Saturday group.",5,295.0,48.0,host,141.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12

177,HANNITY," But all these different factions, and I don't think they can do this in the future. They've got to build consensus behind closed doors, no intramural fighting on to cable television. ",5,184.0,33.0,host,143.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
178,BARTIROMO," There's no doubt about it. And I worried that they are going to face a similar battle when it comes to the tax reform package because the truth is there a lot of things that people are disagreeing on. Number one, border adjustment tax. My opinion? Not going to have it, no border adjustment tax and the tax reform plan.   Number two, deductions. I got an email from one of my sources on the Hill who said to me, Maria, I saw your interview with POTUS, and I'll tell you right now, I cannot support eliminating the property deduction. And I cannot support eliminating the state income tax deduction. These are some of the things they're going back and forth about, so they've got to get on the same page. ",5,705.0,134.0,guest,144.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
179,HANNITY," The other thing, there was a story yesterday that some Republicans don't want to fund the border wall. Democrats are threatening to shut down the government. When they get back on the 24th they've got four days. They will probably go with a continuing resolution I suspect. They have four days before they face a government shutdown. It would be better to bring back Congress, pass the health care bill next week, show America they are actually working. ",5,455.0,80.0,host,145.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
180,BARTIROMO," Absolutely. The problem is that the truth is President Trump does not have any support from the Democrats. And that's really a sad thing. They are really, truly obstructing his cabinet and obstructing his agenda. ",5,214.0,37.0,guest,146.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
181,HANNITY, He doesn't have half his government that needs confirmation. ,5,62.0,11.0,host,147.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12

183,HANNITY," Don't you agree, though, it's kind of inexcusable. The Republicans, they wanted the House in 2010, they got it, the Senate in 2014, then they get the White House. They weren't prepared for repealing and replacing? It's inexcusable.",5,232.0,39.0,host,149.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
184,BARTIROMO," That had no plan. It's ridiculous. Seven years they've been telling us they're going to repeal and replace, it's crazy. And they should have actually repealed, then they would have gotten more support. But we'll see. I think it does take time.",5,244.0,43.0,guest,150.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
185,HANNITY," I'm hearing there's a lot of progress. I think their down to one issue which has to do with waivers. Not the community rating, that's been resolved.",5,149.0,28.0,host,151.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12
186,BARTIROMO," Right. And so I think something will happen. I think they recognize this is a one opportunity, they have a window, that window was quick to close quickly. ",5,156.0,30.0,guest,152.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-12

General, thanks for being with us tonight. Indeed, quite a busy week, especially as it relates to U.S. foreign policy, national security and a number of different geopolitical fronts. What do you think now, if you can compare and contrast for us the juxtaposition from President Trump's approach to foreign policy and how it differs from the previous administration?",1,540.0,87.0,guest,10.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
12,"GEN. JACK KEANE, U.S. ARMY (RET.), FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST"," Yeah, we're seeing a dramatic change here. President Obama and President Trump are facing the same security challenges that are on a scale we have not seen since the end of World War II and the rise of the Soviet Union. President Trump has definitely made a statement that he wants America to exercise global leadership. And he is acting decisively and responsibly, with a moral underpinning to it. And I'm absolutely convinced he's come to the conclusion when America is exercising this global leadership, the world and America is a safer place.  And when that leadership is weak, as it was during these last eight years, in my view, and when we disengage from the world, we embolden our adversaries and we weaken the relationship with our allies to the point that they start making bad decisions.

14,KEANE," Yeah, that is the way it normally is. And the last eight years, it was not that way. Recall three secretary of defenses all had challenges with President Obama in the execution of their duties-- Secretary Gates, Secretary Panetta, and Secretary Hagel was fired over it. The issues were the same, micromanaging the military.  What President Trump has said-- Listen, when we're involved in conflict operations in Iraq, in Afghanistan, other places where we're already there, already committed, what you do with your forces are your decisions. How you use air power is your decisions. How you maneuver forces, those are your decisions. You don't need to get our permission, and we're certainly not going to second-guess those decisions.  What gets-- what-- the result of that, Kimberly, is that we actually make better decisions. And the fact is, the forces are more effective because they can adapt to an enemy that is changing as the days go by. And when you're able to do that and you don't have to ask permission, we're very responsive in getting on top of that enemy. So all of those leaders out there truly applaud that decision to give them the authority and the responsibility to exercise their duties. They love what's happening here.",1,1241.0,213.0,guest,13.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
15,GUILFOYLE," Yeah, and we saw that just, you know, this week now with Afghanistan, and get your reflections on the decision to use that bomb in the area that they used it in. It seems to me this was a smart move strategically, too, and also a little bit of a wake-up call to Pakistan.",1,272.0,55.0,guest,14.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
16,KEANE," Oh, yeah, absolutely. Listen, what we were doing there-- this is ISIS, the Khorasan group in Afghanistan. There were several hundred in a safe haven and caves there, bona fide safe haven. A major lesson we learned out of 9/11-- we permitted the al Qaeda to have a safe haven, by the way, not too far from where the strike was, for a number of years. And by permitting them to do that, we got 9/11, that disaster and that horrific event. That is a major lesson learned. When we find radical Islamists in a safe haven or sanctuary, we have got to pounce on them. And that is what Nichols (sic) did, the general in charge over there. He recognized that-- they tried to do it with infantry forces, took casualties. If I keep doing that, the casualties are just going to rise. What's the biggest thing I can do to take this thing down? Air Force had an answer for him, and he made the right decision here.  He broke the back of that safe haven that ISIS has in Afghanistan. And that's good news for the people of Afghanistan certainly and the Afghan military and also for us because ISIS is an out-of-region organization. They are after Western civilization's values, and they intend to do everything they can to destroy it. So when we find them in a safe haven, we've got to destroy them.",1,1285.0,240.0,guest,15.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
17,GUILFOYLE," Absolutely. And a lot of this traffic back and forth across that border with Pakistan, this-- you know, this needs to stop, especially with the U.S. giving so much aid to Pakistan, as well. So let's talk a bit about North Korea. You know, a lot of people, eyes on North Korea for this weekend, very unstable place right now. What do you see as the U.S. role? What can President Trump do and also working in accord with the president of China, President Xi?",1,457.0,86.0,guest,16.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
18,KEANE," Yeah, well, a couple of things here. First of all, the strike carrier group-- their mission is really to reassure South Korea, reassure Japan that we have got their back, that things have changed. That's why Secretary Mattis has been out to the region. Secretary Tillerson's been out to the region. And obviously, President Trump has met with some of the key leaders from the region. So that's number one. Obviously, the strike carrier group sends a message to North Koreans and the Chinese, reminding them of the significant military options that the United States has in its toolkit here. And this is about as significant as it gets. Secondly, the phone call from President Xi on Wednesday night to President Trump following up to the Mar-a-Lago weekend bilateral meetings is incredibly significant. President Xi told President Trump that, I'm willing-- this was an hour-long conversation, longer because of interpreters, to be sure. But he told him that, I am willing to move in the direction of denuclearizing North Korea. That is a stunning statement! Three presidents prior to President Trump have tried to get the Chinese to do the same thing, 20-plus years of it, and it has failed miserably. If this turns into action and it's not just rhetoric, then President Trump has made a major, major geopolitical achievement to make the world a safer place. We have to see action behind those words.",1,1400.0,237.0,guest,17.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
19,GUILFOYLE," Absolutely. And that's one of the areas that many analysts feel is of greatest concern and threat to the United States, is that instability and that dictatorship in North Korea.  So where do you think, at this point now, President Trump should be focusing his attention because he's got a lot of irons in the fire? Syria-- what should we be doing about Bashar al Assad?",1,370.0,68.0,guest,18.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14

22,KEANE," The regime is solidified and consolidated. Now, we got to be honest about it. The Russians and the Iranians have propped up Assad. The Alawite regime is not going anyplace, anyplace. And all the rhetoric that we're going to find a political solution-- it's not happening.  Assad may be a liability personally because he's reckless, and Putin would trade him out for another Alawite leader, also a thug, I would assume, and we wouldn't make much progress. But bringing that situation to an accommodation where the Syrian people are going to feel good about it, it's not going to happen. We're going to go focus on ISIS. That's what we should do. We should defeat ISIS in eastern Syria. We've got to get that done. Let's get that cleaned up. And then after that, we may be able to have some influence in the Syrian civil war. I don't believe we should get in the middle of it. I think that would be a disaster. But we have squandered the options, and it's tragic because we got 500,000 people dead.

Do you believe that the president is correct to rely on China so heavily with North Korea?",2,313.0,57.0,guest,33.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
42,"RIC GRENELL, FMR. SPOKESMAN FOR U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N."," Absolutely. I think China is the key here, and we haven't been successful in breaking through with China to get them to understand that this is an important issue for us. And it makes sense because China is not threatened by North Korea, so it's not a priority for the Chinese government. However, this meeting between Trump and Xi down at Mar-a-Lago I think was timed perfectly. And something happened that I have never seen in diplomacy in all my years, and that was Donald Trump made perfectly clear to President Xi that we are willing to use all the tools in the tool belt of the U.S. government in order to accomplish our foreign policy goals.  What he said to the president of China was this. You are going to get a better trade deal from us if you help us out on North Korea. Now, Kimberly, I've been inside the Security Council, sitting across from the Russians and the Chinese for almost a decade. And we U.S. diplomats usually are forced to make moral arguments. We say to the Russians, we say to the Chinese, You must do the right thing because it's what the international community says you should do, or it's in your best interests. We are not very good at linking commerce or agriculture or treasury and banking issues. Donald Trump has made it perfectly clear that in order for the Chinese to get a very good trade deal, which they care about, they're going up to do something on North Korea. That was a brilliant move and it happened to be something new that diplomats seldom, if ever, do.",2,1506.0,277.0,guest,34.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
43,GUILFOYLE," I mean, you just wonder about that because it makes such sense as kind of strategic diplomacy, bargaining to make sure, to say, if you want this, we have some mutual interests, but this is something that's important to us and we need you to step up in terms of exerting pressure. It seems like, Wow, why wasn't this done before? And why didn't the Barack Obama administration do anything to kind of further stabilize the area, that area of the region and with North Korea?",2,473.0,87.0,guest,35.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14

48,GRENELL," Well, let me-- let me put it this way. We can trust that China wants a really good trade deal, that they care about the economy. They're having a tough time when you-- when they look at a long-term economic plan for China. There are, you know, a lot of poor people in China. There's a lot of very concerning economic situations on the horizon for China. There are UNICEF, U.N. workers, inside China helping them feed their people.  So the one thing that we can be confident of is that China cares about economic issues, and therefore, when we tie those economic issues to the fact that they've got to help us on North Korea, then I think we're getting their attention. Don't forget, Kimberly, that after their meeting in Mar-a-Lago, President Xi went back to China and moved 175,000 troops to the Chinese border with North Korea.",2,830.0,151.0,guest,40.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14

63,"BRIG. GEN. TONY TATA, U.S. ARMY (RET.)"," Well, Kimberly, great to be with you. I really think the Trump doctrine is one of peace through strength. It's very Reaganesque. When I think back to Jimmy Carter and Reagan coming in and the hostages being held by Iran and not released until Reagan was sworn in, it's pretty much the same thing. I think all around the world, people are beginning to recognize that we are a powerful country. We're not passive anymore. We're not going to be bowing down to our enemies and apologizing. We're going to assert our strength.  And so Mick Nicholson, the general in Afghanistan, made a tactical decision to drop this mother of all bombs on this ratline that goes into Pakistan, but it has strategic implications. And part of the elements of power at play here--sure, we've got the military destroying ISIS in Pakistan and on the Afghan border, and we're also using information. That's-- that's you know, the big reason that this video is being released is because it's an information play to show the world what we can do, much like we did with the Tomahawks and the cruise missiles in Syria.  So lots of elements of national power at play, political, diplomatic, informational, military all coming together to have peace through strength. And we've got to fight our way out of this hole that the Obama administration dug us into.",3,1326.0,234.0,guest,49.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14

67,"MICHAEL WALTZ, U.S. ARMY SPECIAL FORCES (RET.)"," Well, I mean, I just wanted to add to General Tata's comment there. You know, there's been a lot of discussion on what message the cruise missiles, the dropping of the MOAB sends, and what's key is that the commander on the ground did not have to ""Mother, may I"" back to Washington to use the appropriate ordnance. And that sends a critical message to the U.S. military that your commander in chief trusts you. He recognizes that you are the best trained and equipped military in the world, and he's not going to have him or his staff second-guessing you from Washington.  There was story after story from Panetta, from Gates, from Hagel, Obama's secretaries of defense, of National Security Council staffers calling commanders in the field and second-guessing their strategy and their tactical moves. There was this kind of obsession with civilian casualties.  I can tell you as a commander, a green beret, we all understand the implications of that on the ground. I don't need Washington calling and asking me about that. And then you had pilots, as ISIS is charging across Iraq taking over the Middle East, and we finally engage our air force, and you have pilots coming back with their wings still on the bombs -- I'm sorry, bombs still on the wings, and 75 percent of sorties not allowed to drop because we had this obsession with zero civilian casualties.  And the irony there, as we all know, is ISIS went on and massacred tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of civilians. So I think the overall message geopolitically is important, but the message to the U.S. military that we are going to let you do your job and that the commander- in-chief is not going to be worried about strategy -- what success looks like -- some of that is still developing granted but the military is going to be allowed to do what it does best. And that we understand that diplomacy has to work hand-in-hand with military force in order for either one to work. ",3,1957.0,352.0,guest,53.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14

When the commander's intent is broad guidance that you want your subordinate commanders to execute, and you train them and then they go forward and execute your intent. The commander-in-chief's intent, President Trump's intent, is that we kill the enemies of this nation. They are threats everywhere. You look at Iran, you look at Syria, you look at Russia, you look at North Korea, you look at ISIS. Everywhere we're being turned we are being crowded by our enemies to whom we have apologized or given billions of dollars. And now we're trying to fight our way out of this thing.

And what I'm doing is I said to our very great secretary, he's really doing a great job, General Kelly, because you see the numbers where they're down 68 percent. Nobody has ever seen numbers.

87,GUILFOYLE," Joining me now is Fox News contributor Richard Fowler and former Pinal County, Arizona, Sheriff Paul Babeu. Gentlemen, thanks for being here, gentlemen. Lots of news this week, but first off to you, has the administration done a good job so far in terms of signaling that it is a new era and illegal immigration will not be tolerated, sheriff? ",4,345.0,62.0,guest,64.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
88,"PAUL BABEU, FORMER PINAL COUNTY, ARIZONA, SHERIFF"," Absolutely. Wow. What a strong, powerful message from Attorney General Sessions. Not just the words but followed up with actions. He is actually directing all U.S. attorneys to target and prosecute criminal illegals, those who are repeat offenders, continue to come into this country illegally, and hiring additional 125 immigration judges so this whole backlog could be solved and deport these criminals who really pose a risk to our entire community.  This is all after President Trump has actually taken executive actions and actually ordering the enforcement of the law. You have seen these executive orders roll out, and it ends catch and release, which was the rule of the day under Obama, and then also targeting the million criminal illegals throughout the country that law enforcement are going to work together to target them, to apprehend them, and then to deport them for good.  And then of course the signature is to build the great wall. The president himself has personally been looking, reviewing these plans. We know him as a great builder. And this is going to be done. These are no longer just promises, they're not campaign piece. We are seeing action, resulting evidence 70 percent now reduction in illegal entries crossing the border illegally. ",4,1268.0,212.0,guest,65.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
89,GUILFOYLE," A huge number drop. Richard, you have a lot to work with right there, so where do you want to begin? ",4,102.0,23.0,guest,66.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
90,"RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," A couple points. I think what we know for a fact is over the past 20 years we have seen a decrease in border crossing. We've had those research and studies from the border patrol. But beyond that point is we know this -- in President Trump's budget, he has allocated $51 billion to go to build this so called unpractical, unrealistic, and I would argue un-American walls. But this money is being taken away from American students who need textbooks in the city of Detroit or American citizen in Chicago who don't have heat in their classrooms because the department of education is taking a 14 percent cut.  So we have to really have a conversation with ourselves as Americans as to how we balance protecting our border, quote-unquote, and making sure that we are enriching our future. If we really want to, quote-unquote, make America great again, then let's invest in America's kids, let's invest in our greatest resource.  And I would go further to make one other point about this sort of Trump era and this Trump Justice Department. I don't ascribe to it because I find a lot of our policies to be taking our country backwards instead of moving us forwards as we should. We are a nation of immigrants, and we have 11 million of them here living in the shadows, and we need to do everything in our power to make sure that we deal with those undocumented immigrants and provide them a pathway to citizenship. ",4,1412.0,257.0,guest,67.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
91,GUILFOYLE," Richard, well stated, but we are also a nation of laws, and I worked as a prosecutor in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and I saw repeated abuses, the laws that were not followed. Dangerous things have happened in sanctuary cities like San Francisco, and what's wrong with actually enforcing the laws that are on the books currently, Richard? ",4,343.0,61.0,guest,68.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
92,FOWLER," I have no problem enforcing the laws that are currently on the books. And I have no problem with deporting people who are ax murderers, rapists, and child abusers. But what we see under Donald Trump's America is you're deporting people who haven't paid their traffic tickets. ",4,277.0,49.0,guest,69.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14

105,TRUMP," In the past few decades, political correctness, oh, what a terrible term, has transformed our institutions of higher education from ones that fostered spirited debates to a place of extreme censorship where students are silenced for the smallest of things. You say a word somewhat differently and all of a sudden you are criticized, sometimes viciously. We will end the political correctness and force a free and respectful dialogue.

107,GUILFOYLE," That with a flashback to then candidate Donald Trump promising to fight back against political correctness at America's colleges and universities and for good reason. This month alone we have seen protests at Notre Dame over a schedule commencement speech from Vice President Mike Pence because it's making some students feel, quote, ""unsafe.""  Also this month at California's Claremont Mckenna College, a speech by Heather McDonald was disrupted by Black Lives Matter protesters who physically blocked the entrances to her advents. And now at Duquesne University, some members of the student government association are working to block a Chick-fil-A from coming to campus out of concerns over, quote, ""student safety.""  So how can President Trump work to change this culture at America's universities? Joining us now from Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk, and Democratic strategist and director of research at Bustle.com Jessica Tarlov. Thank you both for being here with us tonight. Jessica, you look at the news cycle and you see these stories happening over and over again. And I guess the first question would be what causes this liberal groupthink mentality in higher education that seems quite pervasive, Jessica? ",5,1221.0,195.0,guest,79.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
108,"JESSICA TARLOV, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST"," I think of a lot of it obviously has to do with the professors themselves. We know the majority of professors are liberal, and I don't think actually there has to be anything wrong with that. I think what we need to get back to understanding is what the First Amendment is all about.  And I think that when you have protests at some of these speeches, that's fine, violence never fine. Maybe blocking the doors is going too far.  But the complication for me with all of this is that when it distracts from actual issues of hate speech or racism. We saw this last year in the big story at the University of Missouri. There were actual incidents going on. And then you had that professor who said we need some muscle in here. And a complicated issue and the national story became about her and not what was actually going on on that campus. So there is a middle ground and it's incredibly important that we listen to the other side here, but I think that has to start with the professors and also the national dialogue. ",5,1019.0,194.0,guest,80.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
109,GUILFOYLE," Charlie, it just seems to me you're supposed to get a great education in college, have an open mind, listen to other people's viewpoints, as Jessica is saying, but it's really what we're saying is this movement of stamping down diversity of thought and opinion to a groupthink that isn't healthy for America's youth. ",5,318.0,56.0,guest,81.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
110,"CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA"," That's right. And Jessica brings a great point. This actually does the far leftwing campus activists a disservice when they want to point out real hate speech on campus. Trying to bring a Chick-fil-A to campus is all of a sudden considered dangerous and unsafe? Are they worried that delicious chicken sandwiches are going to make students unsafe? Essentially they are saying is ""We disagree with the owners of Chick-fil-A. Therefore it should not be opened on campus.""  You bring up a great point about diversity. One of the students at Notre Dame that was protesting the potential visit for commencement speech for Vice President Pence, he had a sign that said ""Diversity is our strength."" I agree, but it should be intellectual diversity is our strength. Racial diversity is great, but we need to get back to being able to entertain ideas that you don't agree with. And our colleges are not fostering those discussions.  And unfortunately Notre Dame is one of the greatest schools in the country and it had students even given an audience to say we shouldn't have the vice president of the United States because we disagree with him. I don't think that's what college is supposed to be about. I think Jessica agrees with that. And I don't believe it's good for the country, it's good for the dialogue to continue to silence people you disagree with. On these campuses, there's no my diversity of thought, and I think it's a dangerous precedent to be set. ",5,1459.0,256.0,guest,82.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
111,GUILFOYLE," It really is. And I encourage people to go and speak at universities, Jessica, to have an open dialogue. I've spoken at Cornell and it was well received, better than poor Jesse Watters who was booted off campus. But it makes no sense to me. I come from San Francisco, very liberal, very open-minded place. U.C. Davis, I am familiar with the U.C. system. It wasn't like that then. This has gotten so out of hand that it worries me that we are sending our youth and they are coming out of college ill prepared to deal with the reality of life. Nobody's going to give you-- ",5,572.0,109.0,guest,83.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
112,TARLOV," You can't pick your coworkers. You're going to go and get a job and there are going to be people there who think things that are different from you. I know last year we also saw that Jason Riley was disinvited from UVA. WE had issues with Ray Kelly, former New York City police commissioner. I think that was at Brown.  The most useful thing that you can do, I believe strongly, and I come on here and I talk to people who are conservatives all the time because I think it's the best used of my time to put out my viewpoints and what I think is an arguably constructive, is to make sure that you show up and you present your rationality of your case so that they most amount of people can hear what you have to assay.  So go to those rallies, go to those speeches, raise your hand, get called on, submit a question, write a letter to the editor and papers. But don't get a violent and don't distract from this, because I think the liberals, and maybe this is not the far, far left, but we have important things to say about the dangers of the Trump administration and many of these policies, about what Mike Pence believes. You can pick them apart on policy, but it's really important to show up and be constructive about it, to move forward. ",5,1244.0,241.0,guest,84.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
113,GUILFOYLE," I think that such great advice. Charlie, what is your advice for kids out there, conservative students that want to go to university? ",5,135.0,25.0,guest,85.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
114,KIRK," So I am a big fan of students trying to go to schools like Hillsdale that are more conservative schools. But if you're a conservative don't be afraid to go to the very liberal schools and stand up to what you believe in. And be the champions of free speech. As Jessica noted, that's something that is not always being fought for today on our college campuses. And it's being eroded quickly.  And look, you have to be able to not just fight for what you want to say but also fight for things you might not want to hear. That's what free speech is all about. And what's going on on the campuses right now is that the administrators and the faculty are encouraging some very far left wing activist voices to silence conservatives.  And I pose a question to liberals on campus, if you're so confident on what you believe in, shouldn't you want more conservatives on campus so you can prove them wrong? Why try to shut them down? Why try to disprove them? Encourage more conservative voices and then show them why they're so wrong. Don't try to storm the stage, don't try to block the door, don't try to riot or do dangerous protests or even in the sense of Duquesne University, don't shut down a private business. I think that's so deconstructive of what college --",5,1262.0,235.0,guest,86.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
115,TARLOV," It totally is, but I think that it's also beholden to conservatives to play a part in this and to call out what is more towards hate speech. People in the alt right, I think it's important to distinguish what is just conservativism, a relatively safe ideology as it were, certainly in terms of the more mainstream Republicans -- to separate that from the Richard Spencers of the world. ",5,387.0,71.0,guest,87.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
116,KIRK," Chick-fil-A is not hate speech, though. So it totally delegitimizes these activists to say Chick-fil-A must be gone because it's hate speech. Vice president Pence because it's hate speech, Heather McDonald because it's hate speech. ",5,233.0,37.0,guest,88.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14

9,GRIFFIN," The GBU44 is the largest non-nuclear weapon the U.S. military has ever used in combat. Designed for the Iraq war but never used, tested in 2003, the MOAB is a concussive GOP-guided bomb that is pushed out of the back of a modified C-130 aircraft. Its blast radius is one mile wide. The Pentagon says the top general in Afghanistan didn't need to ask permission to conduct the strike. The target of the explosion was a series of tunnels near a Achin province in Nangarhar province 35 miles south of Jalalabad, where the U.S. has a base. On Saturday, an American Green Beret was killed by small arms fire in that part of Nangarhar province, Staff Sergeant Mark De Alencar of Edgewood, Maryland, part of an ISIS-clearing operation. The U.S. military says the strike today was not in retaliation for the Green Beret's death. The president announced yesterday after meeting with NATO's secretary- general at the White House that national security adviser H.R. McMaster is leaving soon for Afghanistan, and the top commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, testified recently, Kimberly, that he needs several thousand more U.S. or NATO troops for Afghanistan -- Kimberly.",1,1174.0,196.0,guest,6.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14

A monitoring group released satellite images that shows activity at a North Korean nuclear site. President Trump is calling on China to help defuse the situation, but says if Beijing fails to act, then the U.S. and its allies will.

That's what Assad calls anyone he doesn't like. They"" -- meaning the United States -- ""fabricated the whole story in order to have a pretext for the attack."" In an exhaustive presentation, the Pentagon went as far to put out the radar track of the Syrian jet that dropped the sarin bomb, and the U.S. the secretary of state doubled down on the charge in front of Assad's Russian protectors yesterday.

Part of the grand bargain to stave off a U.S. attack was Russia's assurance they would destroy all of Assad's chemical weapons, begging the question now, Kimberly, if the Russians intentionally left Assad with a chemical arsenal or were simply hoodwinked by their own proxy.",1,456.0,76.0,guest,10.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14

I think it's very interesting. You now have with General Mattis and with General McMaster real professionals who are giving the president serious military advice, exactly the sort of thing that Barack Obama always rejected.

25,GINGRICH," (INAUDIBLE) useful (ph). And by the way, somebody made a comment to me that was fascinating. They said if you want to take video of the foreign minister of Russia meeting with Hillary Clinton, meeting with John Kerry, and meeting with Rex Tillerson, it'll give you a real sense of how much real power Tillerson carries just in his bearing and his sophistication and his maturity because he's different than the other people that Lavrov has worked with. And I thought that was a fascinating commentary on what a great job Secretary Tillerson's doing for America.",1,562.0,97.0,guest,20.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
26,GUILFOYLE," Yes, fantastic. You see a lot of kind of feedback, people saying, you know, how they thought that he did. I thought it was very strong and decisive. And he showed no hesitation in bringing up directly to Putin and the individuals there all of the issues and problems that the United States has with Russia.  Wow, this must have been quite a surprise to all the people that thought that the president was going to so chummy with Putin and not be strong with Russia.",1,465.0,88.0,guest,21.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
27,GINGRICH," Well, look, I think if President Trump could find a way to do it, he'd like to be friends with Russia. ",1,104.0,23.0,guest,22.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14

29,GINGRICH," He doesn't -- and he doesn't have any great interest in going out of the way to start a fight, but he's not going to give an inch on things like gassing children, which I think really got to the president emotionally. And the fact is that Rex Tillerson, when he was the head of ExxonMobil had negotiated several multi-billion-dollar deals with the Russians. He knows how to deal with them. He's not afraid of them. He's not confused by them. And without being hostile, he was very direct.",1,489.0,90.0,guest,24.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
30,GUILFOYLE," Yes. Absolutely. And you have to be firm, and now we are getting to see exactly what kind of president Mr. Trump is. And he's being very true, it seems to me, to his campaign promises and being decisive and using the strength of the American military, which he has already shown a great respect for.  So I want to segue a little bit about North Korea. You know, a new report says that North Korea could be preparing a new nuclear test. And if they do, how should President Trump respond?",1,488.0,94.0,guest,25.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
31,GINGRICH," Well, the more fascinating question is what are the Chinese going to do? ",1,74.0,15.0,guest,26.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
32,GUILFOYLE, Yes.,1,5.0,2.0,guest,27.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
33,GINGRICH," The Chinese have moved 150,000 troops to the North Korean border. They have changed their purchases of coal and have tightened up on sanctions against North Korea. And they have said publicly that the North Koreans had better not engage in this nuclear test.  And remember, if it's an underground facility, what we just proved in Afghanistan was we have weapons which without going nuclear -- we have huge non-nuclear conventional weapons that could take out these kind of facilities.  So I think the Chinese are trying to say to him, Look, you got to President Trump seriously. This is not like the good old days. And you better be careful. So the first reaction ought to be, let's look at the Chinese, who, by the way, did abstain at the U.N. and President Trump was exactly right to say this was a major step in the right direction, when on the Syrian resolution, they abstained, leaving the Russians all by themselves as the only country voting no.",1,953.0,171.0,guest,28.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
34,GUILFOYLE," Absolutely. Now, do you think that it's -- you know, we can have this kind of confidence in terms of the relationship with, you know, the president of China and President Trump working together cooperatively? Because I think people are concerned because nobody seems to be able to control North Korea and Kim Jong-un.",1,318.0,55.0,guest,29.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
35,GINGRICH," Yes, and I'm not sure the Chinese can, either, so I don't think you can wave a magic wand.  But what was clear to me was that President Trump recommended that they go off by themselves, get away from the staff. They had a two-hour meeting the first day and another one-hour meeting the second day. And apparently, the chemistry was very good.  You may remember that Reagan did the same thing with Gorbachev when they first met. ",1,429.0,82.0,guest,30.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14

37,GINGRICH," He said, Let's go for a walk. Let's just get out of here, just you and me and the interpreter. I think that that does lead to a different attitude, a different willingness to work. I think that's what President Trump hoped he could do with Putin, and Putin has simply been too difficult to deal with to try to have that kind of a personal conversation. But I do think there's a possibility that we're on the edge of some serious progress with China.",1,450.0,86.0,guest,32.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
38,GUILFOYLE," Yes, absolutely. And I think you bring up such a great point because it's that interpersonal relationship, that dynamic and establishing that bond that it appears that President Trump successfully once again did with President Xi, that he can pick up the phone, call him, work cooperatively with open lines of communication. I mean, that's real leadership, and someone who's, you know, used to being an executive and making the decisions and establishing those relationships. I think we see if you agree, you know, that this is working very well for this new U.S. foreign policy with President Trump.",1,601.0,100.0,guest,33.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
39,GINGRICH," It's a tremendous potential. It went much better at Mar-a-Lago than I thought it would, and I think that the president deserves a lot of credit. I also think, frankly, that Ivanka's children, who are studying at a school where they're learning Mandarin -- I am told that it was a very big hit in China, the video of the children singing in Mandarin. And we shouldn't underestimate that people to people sometimes breaks through, where policy arguments don't. And they may have gone home with a better feeling toward that Trump family then they thought they would have.",1,569.0,100.0,guest,34.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
40,GUILFOYLE," Absolutely. Such a great point. I saw that video and I retweeted it. I thought it was fantastic. What an amazing way to connect with the people and make them feel welcome.  Mr. Speaker, always a pleasure. Thank you so much.",1,224.0,43.0,guest,35.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14

44,GUILFOYLE," Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Earlier today, the United States sent a big message to our enemies around the world after deploying what is called the, quote, ""mother of all bombs"" on an ISIS tunnel complex in eastern Afghanistan. So why is this one bomb getting so much attention?  Joining us now with reaction is the author of ""The Siege,"" retired brigadier general Tony Tata and retired U.S. Army Special Forces officer Michael Waltz. Gentlemen, thank you for being here tonight on such an important news day. General Tata, I'll begin witness you. Why was the mother of all bombs developed in the first place?

47,TATA," ... clear landing zones for helicopters. And this bomb explodes about six feet off the ground and sends all its energy in a 300-meter radius around. But what's really happening here is at the bigger strategic picture, Kimberly, it's almost as if for the last eight years, the lights have been off. The Trump administration has come in and turn the lights on. There's cockroaches everywhere. And now we have to do some kind of damage control to clean this up so that our vital interests aren't threatened the way they have been when we apologize to our enemies and ignore the threats that are out there.  And I know General Mick Nicholson very well. We worked together in Afghanistan, Kimberly. And Mick -- if Mick is dropping a MOAB on a known ratline into Pakistan to kill ISIS fighters, I know for a fact that that -- it was a valid target, one that we needed to drop on and close some cave mouths and drop some tunnels on some enemy. And this is a very effective weapon because all its energy goes out and kills the personnel that you're trying to kill. It doesn't go into the ground and get dissipated into the ground.",2,1123.0,208.0,guest,41.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
48,GUILFOYLE," Yes, and apparently, we'll be able to get -- hopefully, once they declassify it and they scrub (ph) it, we'll be able to get, you know, the video of that.  So Michael, what do you think about this in terms of the presence of ISIS in Afghanistan, and you know, just so many long years hard fought there in an area that is still so troubled and problematic?",2,356.0,70.0,guest,42.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
49,"MICHAEL WALTZ, U.S. ARMY SPECIAL FORCES (RET.) (on-camera)"," Well, that's right, Kim. And just to add to General Tata's point, you know, over the last eight years, all anybody in the region has heard is withdrawal, withdrawal, withdrawal. And that has caused everybody, including our enemies, to wait us out and to hedge against us. And you know, what I think we're seeing here is a completely different message, but I'm sure a lot of viewers and a lot of folks are saying, Wait a minute. This isn't what President Trump campaigned on. You know, we're going to be stuck in this forever war.  But I think we've learned now and I'm sure he is listening to his key advisers, Mattis and McMaster, that, you know, we -- we cannot turn our back on the region like we did in Iraq. We cannot have another Iraq. ISIS, al Qaeda, the Taliban will be resurgent in that part of the world, except it's going to be 10 times worse in that Pakistan, right next door, has 10 times the population and with nuclear weapons. On a tactical level, you know, if we had not sent in the MOAB, it would taken thousands of soldiers to clear those caves. And you know, we just lost a Green Beret this last weekend. I think it was absolutely the right move. And I'm glad to see General -- excuse me, President Trump giving his generals the authority to make the right operational decisions.",2,1300.0,243.0,guest,43.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14

And I promise you, if Mick Nicholson is saying, I've got a problem here -- and this is -- this is the same ratline that Usama bin Laden used to get out of Afghanistan into Pakistan, and I can tell you it's a real issue, you know, Kimberly, that we've got ISIS inside Pakistan because that tells you that the IS from Pakistan, the Intelligence Service from Pakistan and the Pakistan government is complicit here. And I've watched -- Mick and I have stood by each other watching grainy footage of Predators and the Pak military -- Pakistan military wave in al Qaeda and others through to attack our bases.

You know, what they're really trying to do is undermine NATO and undermine the United States in yet another theater.

72,GUILFOYLE, This is a Fox News Alert. The Mexican drug cartel member who is suspected of killing Border Patrol agent Brian Terry in 2010 was arrested yesterday in Mexico.  Joining us now with the very latest is William La Jeunesse -- William.,3,231.0,43.0,guest,61.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
73,"WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT"," Kimberly, tonight, we know more about the suspect, his alleged role in the death of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry, as well as his criminal history. So the arrest came around 2:00 AM Wednesday when a joint U.S.-Mexican police task force captured the suspect at a ranch in northern Mexico along the Chihuahua/Sinaloa border. The task force included Mexican marines, the DEA, and the U.S. Marshals Service. Heraclio Osorio-Arellanes was turned over to the Mexican attorney general. The U.S. is seeking extradition and he faces 30 years to life. Arellanes is a Mexico national. We have learned he was apprehended seven times by the border patrol and arrested once for a DUI before joining the rip crew that killed Agent Terry in the desert south of Tucson in December of 2010. Terry was part of the border patrol special ops unit that took a bullet beneath his vest and died at the scene. His death exposed the Obama administration's Operation Fast and Furious after agents found two assault style weapons at the scene sold under the U.S. program. In all, the Justice Department approved the sale of some 2,000 weapons to the Mexican cartels.  Now I am told that Arellanes is tied to the scene by DNA, and according to five others who are already in prison, he fired the shot that killed Agent Terry. Kimberly, back to you.

75,"LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK"," A disaster for the Obama administration, a disaster for the family of Brian Terry, for all Americans who care about our border security and law and order. This was a disaster for the Obama administration in retrospect now because what happens after two months of President Trump being in office? Another of Brian Terry's killers has been produced the government of Mexico. It's not accident. It took five-and-a- half years under President Obama for nothing to happen. And now suddenly they are producing the killers of Brian Terry. Justice is moving forward. And, by the way, the one suspect still at large I would wager would be caught very, very soon. ",3,655.0,113.0,guest,64.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
76,GUILFOYLE," So you think there is a direct link to President Trump being in and these accomplishments? This is one of the biggest things that he talked about as candidate Trump was border security and giving the power and the control back to the border patrol agents, protecting them so they wouldn't be penalized or prosecuted like they were under previous administrations. ",3,364.0,63.0,guest,65.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
77,DOBBS," At this time the president of the United States is supporting those who keep our borders secure and demands of Mexico that it be a responsible, mature partner in policing that border and securing it. And the Mexican government is responding. This is one example of it.  And I think you are going to see more positives like this as we go forward. Remember, how big is this? We are talking about it has taken almost seven years since Eric Holder at the attorney general of the United States lied to Congress, was cited for contempt of Congress, the only cabinet member in our history to ever be found in contempt of Congress. And we are now seeing, we hope, change that will mean partnership rather than opposition between the governments of Mexico and the United States and justice for the Brian Terry family, all border patrol agents and all Americans who care about this country and law and order. ",3,900.0,163.0,guest,66.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
78,GUILFOYLE," Absolutely. And it's almost just shocking and it is just appalling to me, a former prosecutor, that it took this long to be able to get these arrests and make this happen. But let's talk a little bit also about the president's immigration policy. We are already seeing, by the way, some are calling it Trump's the wall himself because there's been a deterrent effect and the numbers are really dramatically different than they were under President Obama in terms of people saying wait, maybe I better not come in here. ",3,520.0,93.0,guest,67.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
79,DOBBS," It's 70 percent fewer over each of the past two months. We are also seeing a president who is not afraid even as Speaker Paul Ryan says we won't be able to get funding for that this year, the president reminds Ryan who is president and says 100 percent certain we are going to have the wall. It's a change of attitude. Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the border yesterday saying this is the era of Trump and we will prosecute document fraud as felonies. We will prosecute criminal illegal aliens, and we will send them, deport them to wherever they come from. ",3,563.0,105.0,guest,68.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
80,GUILFOYLE," It's a great point about Jeff Sessions.

He stands with him strongly now. Together they are a formidable force, reversing much of the Obama administration's disastrous refusal to enforce immigration law and to secure our borders. ",3,364.0,60.0,guest,72.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
84,GUILFOYLE," Real quick, what about the wall? He's promised he's going to build this wall.

94,GUILFOYLE," Welcome back to ""Hannity."" During a panel discussion in Washington yesterday, former Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri admitted that members of the media lean to the left, but then claimed that due to their slant, they are harder on Democrats. Watch this. ",4,282.0,45.0,guest,80.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14

96,PALMIERI," I think most journalists are probably leaning more to the left than the right. Think about the kind of person that is drawn to do this as a career. They believe in government, they think politics matter, they like it, they find it interesting. They don't make a lot of money. That doesn't seem to concern them. But what I have found means that they come after us harder on what I describe as the crap. They come after us harder on the place intrigue, on the process, on things that really shouldn't matter.

98,GUILFOYLE," Joining me now with reaction is former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer. He was on the panel yesterday. And also with us is Trump transition executive committee member and founder of SkyBridge Capital Anthony Scaramucci. Gentlemen, thanks for being here with me tonight. So Air, I will begin with you. You were on the panel with her. What do you think, is there any substance to those claims that the press is tougher on Democratic administrations than Republicans? ",4,476.0,81.0,guest,82.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
99,"ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY"," Kimberly, first it's great to hear a Democrat acknowledge what Republicans have said for years, which is that the press largely comes from the left. But the notion of that that means they are harder on the left is nonsensical. Take the palace intrigue that she talked about. Have you ever seen more palace intrigue coverage and tougher coverage than on Donald Trump right now? ",4,378.0,67.0,guest,83.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
100,GUILFOYLE, No.,4,4.0,2.0,guest,84.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
101,FLEISCHER," I think the press gets credit for being tough on Hillary for her email scandal, and that was a scandal that was hard to overlook. They were tough on Hillary's husband for his Monica scandal, another scandal hard to overlook. But when it comes to day in day out coverage, the press so much harder on Republicans than Democrats, and they're triply as hard on Donald Trump as they are on everybody else. And they were soft on Barack Obama. ",4,438.0,82.0,guest,85.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
102,GUILFOYLE," Anthony, you have been on inside, part of the transition team. So you experienced it, felt it up close and personal. ",4,118.0,23.0,guest,86.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
103,"ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, TRUMP TRANSITION EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBER"," And I think to add to what Ari is you have a situation where there's a lot of personal assassination, Kimberly, because they don't like the policies of the right. And so what they try to do is identify who is a weak link or who could be slipping in favor, and then they do a massive pile on to see if they can knock that person out. Andy Puzder would be an example of that. The labor secretary designee, unbelievably talented guy, all of that was political rigmarole, totally unnecessary. And they characterized him in a certain way, and he such a gentleman that he stepped out of the process so that it wouldn't detract from the president of the United States. And so they are effective at this, unfortunately, and they do it all the time. ",4,742.0,140.0,guest,87.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
104,GUILFOYLE," Ari, what you think in terms of the communication and how that is going in terms of the Trump administration? The press after him every single day, looking for any kind of thing that can blow up. ",4,197.0,39.0,guest,88.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
105,FLEISCHER," I keep a file, I keep a file, and it's a bulging file that gets bigger every day of vivid examples that I think the press has done that illustrates the bias. Just yesterday ""Washington Post"" had story about Attorney General Sessions down at the border and how he wanted to crack down on people who are criminals coming into America. And the story conflated illegal immigration with immigration and talked about how Republicans wanted to crack down on immigration. And it quoted not one, not two, not three, but four people who are against what Sessions did. It did not have one quote of any expert or Republican supporting what the attorney general did. And nobody at ""The Post"" catches this stuff. And that's the bias in the newsroom that bothers me so much. ",4,761.0,137.0,guest,89.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
106,GUILFOYLE," Yes. It's tough to experience up close and personal, it's tough I think even for our viewers to see. ",4,102.0,21.0,guest,90.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
107,SCARAMUCCI," It is a blood sport. You have to have a really thick skin. I do give her some credit for what she said, though. She did admit to the bias. It is a very big bias, Kimberly, but I do think the Republicans have to take a ""no whining"" approach on this and just hit as hard as we can on the policies, because with the right communication, right communication strategies, I think we're right on the policies and we'll win the American people. And the president has done a great job of coming over the top and using Twitter, other devices in social media to relate directly to the people, recognizing that bias in the media. ",4,619.0,119.0,guest,91.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
108,GUILFOYLE," He's very effective, I think you would agree, in terms of his messaging and communicating and having that transparency, sort of a one-on- one relationship with the American people, but it's also out of necessity. ",4,214.0,37.0,guest,92.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
109,SCARAMUCCI," And he's also done something -- people now believe what Ms. Palmieri said about the media. It is very biased, very slanted to the left. And the president as a candidate and as president has done a very effective job of giving them more and more evidence every day. ",4,266.0,51.0,guest,93.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
110,GUILFOYLE," What about those in the Trump administration that have said essentially the press is the opposition party, that that is how difficult and contentious the relationship is? Do you agree? And if so, what can the Trump administration do to improve their relationship with the press? ",4,280.0,48.0,guest,94.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
111,FLEISCHER," A Gallup poll came out last week that asked voters whether they thought the press was favored towards the Democrats, the Republicans, and some 62 percent said the press was biased to the Democrats, some 22 percent said it's biased toward Republicans. So it's an uphill fight for Republicans at all times. And to some degree the press is the opposition party. Their role is to be the devil's advocate to whoever is in government, but like I said before, they were soft on Obama and very hard on Donald Trump.  Sometimes Donald Trump deserves it, though, and earns it, and I don't object to the press being tough on him. But when they are too tough, too oppositional, when they just can't stand anything he does, that's the real problem and that's where I fault the press for not even giving Donald Trump a chance in most instances.

112,GUILFOYLE, Anthony? ,4,10.0,3.0,guest,96.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
113,SCARAMUCCI," I would tell my fellow Republicans a ""no whining"" strategy, stick to great communication and understanding and explaining policies to the American people. We have so many devices now that can go right over the top, Kimberly. That's our best strategy and we have to use that to win the legislative and policy battles.

114,GUILFOYLE," He's definitely had a lot of accomplishments so far already in less than 100 days. Gentlemen, thank you so much for being with me.  Coming up, President Trump shows the world what leading from the front looks like and that he means business. Up next we will get reaction from Herman Cain. Stay with us.

116,GUILFOYLE," Welcome back to ""Hannity."" The days of America leading from behind are over. Earlier today President Trump sent a message to America's enemies after dropping the, quote, ""mother of all bombs"" on an ISIS installation in a remote area of Afghanistan. This is just the latest example of newfound American leadership. It has been a very busy week for President Trump. Watch this. ",5,377.0,65.0,guest,99.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14

118,TRUMP," We are sending an armada, very powerful. We have submarines, very powerful, far more powerful than the aircraft carrier, that I can tell you. I can tell you China will do much better on trade if they help us with North Korea. ",5,227.0,44.0,guest,100.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
119,UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE, And you think he knows that? ,5,30.0,8.0,guest,101.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
120,TRUMP," I think he knows that. I told him that, yes.  Frankly, Putin is backing a person that is truly an evil person.  The vicious slaughter of innocent civilians with chemical weapons including the barbaric killing of small and helpless children and babies must be forcefully rejected by any nation that values human life.  I thought we had to do something about it. I have absolutely no doubt we did the right thing. ",5,413.0,77.0,guest,102.0,1,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14

122,GUILFOYLE," And joining is now with reaction is former presidential candidate and Fox News contributor, Herman Cain. So after this week, how much leverage do you think that the United States has gained or lost with Russia when it comes to the situation in Syria? ",5,252.0,46.0,guest,103.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
123,"HERMAN CAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," I believe, Kimberly, that our leverage has gone up significantly because this president has demonstrated, as you said, we are going to lead from the front, not from behind. But secondly, it shows he is decisive and not afraid to act.  Now, this sends a second strong message to our enemies and our allies that this president and this administration is serious. Here's something that probably the liberal media is not going to talk about after this incident today in Afghanistan. They are not going to talk about the fact that the military probably already knew about these ISIS targets, but we had an administration to before that didn't want to do anything about it. Now we have an administration and a president that is willing to do something about it. ",5,757.0,134.0,guest,104.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
124,GUILFOYLE," You know, and this was consistent with the rhetoric during the campaign of candidate Trump that he would act on military intelligence, that he wasn't going to a person that would draw a redline and then do nothing. He is getting these Intel reports and acting decisively within the first 100 days of his administration. What kind of message as well does this send to North Korea? I want to talk about that for a moment. ",5,421.0,78.0,guest,105.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
125,CAIN," Unfortunately, it won't send a message to North Korea because they aren't listening. They aren't listening to the actions of the United States. They aren't listening to the rest of the world. They aren't listening to the United Nations, so it won't send a message to them.  But what it does do is it sends a message to the rest of the world that the United States is not going to tolerate things that have been tolerated in the past. To countries like China, it sends a message to them. Countries like Russia, even though they are in denial about what happened in Syria, it's going to send a strong message to him.  And here's the other thing, I hope it sends a strong message to Iran that if you try to taunt our ships again, the result may be a little different than just letting you taunt our ships and we do nothing about it. ",5,831.0,160.0,guest,106.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
126,GUILFOYLE," These recent threats, too, with North Korea, I am concerned, Mr. Cain, because, like you said, they don't listen. But there seems to be a little bit of an expectation that China's President Xi will in fact be able to do something about this, and you heard those comments from the president today that he had good expectation, a good relationship with him, and was hoping that he might be able to control North Korea. ",5,418.0,77.0,guest,107.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
127,CAIN," We have seen two examples already where China is listening and may be changing in order to try to put some impact on North Korea. First, North Korea sent some cargo ships of coal, their primary resource, to China, and guess what, China sent them back home. And then the second thing what happened with the U.N. revolution. Russia, they would not vote to put sanctions on Syria, but China simply abstained, which is another way of saying we are not going to tolerate their actions. So I happen to believe that China is showing signs that they will help us put pressure on North Korea, and that is a good thing.  And let me add one other point. The United States is not starting this stuff. The United States is simply responding to this stuff. And the same message goes to North Korea and Kim Jong-un. We aren't going to start a fight, but if they start a fight, then the United States under this administration will probably end that fight. ",5,942.0,175.0,guest,108.0,0,Fox News,Hannity,2017-04-14
