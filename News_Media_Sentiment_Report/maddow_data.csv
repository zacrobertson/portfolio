0,"RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST"," And thanks to at home for joining us this hour. There is a lot going on in the news right now. Today, we got a new United States Supreme Court justice, who many people will now call Justice Neil Gorsuch. But many other people will insist on calling him Justice Merrick Garland or some variety of that because it will never ever, ever, ever, ever be normal that Senate Republicans wouldn`t allow President Obama to appoint a justice to fill that seat on the court simply because he was a president from the Democratic Party that will never ever, ever be normal. So as far as I`m concerned, today, Justice Neil “Merrick Garland” Gorsuch got sworn in and the court is back to nine members. And the president is now established that henceforth in our country, no president will get to nominate Supreme Court justices anymore unless his or her party also controls the United States Senate that is the new standard in our country. But with Gorsuch/Garland being sworn in today, that is officially the way it`s going to be from here on out. Welcome to your new Supreme Court era in American history. Also today, the White House apparently scrapped its next big policy plan which was to redo the tax code after their face plant trying to repeal Obamacare and getting nowhere with that. Apparently, they are getting shy about big policy stuff. They are getting shy about trying to do a taxes overhaul as well. That is according to the “Associated Press” today. Congress is on recess this week. The plan to redo the tax code has been a convenient hook for constituents back home to berate their members of Congress that Donald Trump shouldn`t be allowed to change anything about the tax code as long as he hasn`t released his own taxes. So, we can all check to see if he`s making new tax policy that`s designed to help himself. But this president really does not want to release his taxes and apparently now he won`t be overhauling anybody else`s taxes either. The Republicans are giving up on that at least for now. Today, Defense Secretary James Mattis said that the U.S. missile strike on that Syrian air base last week, today, Jim Mattis said that that airbase strike destroyed 20 percent of the operational aircraft in the Syrian air force. Now, if you`re trying to keep track of this particular statistic, let`s be clear as to why it`s hard to keep track of this. So far, the administration has said that that strike, that missile strike last Thursday destroyed twenty planes at that one base. They`ve also said that it`s destroyed 20 percent of the planes in one wing of the Syrian air force. They`ve also said that it destroyed twenty percent of the planes that are actually operational in the Syrian air force and they`ve also said that it destroyed 20 percent of all the planes total in the Syrian air force. All of those things cannot be true simultaneously. Which of those things is true, who knows? But by tomorrow, the way this is going, they`ll presumably be telling us that that strike destroyed a hundred and twenty percent of all the planes in Syria. It destroyed twelve thousand percent of all the Muslim flames everywhere. You guys got to figure this one out. It`s been five days. Today, the deputy national security adviser lost her job. They are reportedly going to try to send her to Singapore instead, to be an ambassador despite her reportedly lobbying for a job that would keep her in D.C. This administration has not been around very long, but already, this is the second deputy national security adviser to leave. And, of course, the actual national security advisor left after only 24 days on the job. We`ve also seen a top White House communications guy named Boris, we saw him mysteriously get the boot a couple of weeks ago, and then we saw the deputy White House chief of staff mysteriously get the boot a little over a week ago, and that`s not even counting presidential advisor Steve Bannon getting demoted off the National Security Council last week, nor is it counting the six White House staffers, including the chief digital officer who got fired after failing their background checks. This administration isn`t even three months old yet, but it`s already shedding staff like water off a lame duck. Tonight, this hour, on the show, we`ve got the latest from Alabama with the political reporter who was absolutely tip of the spear when it came to the two came to this sex and ethics scandal that today resulted in the resignation of the governor of Alabama, Robert Bentley. We`ve also got a fascinating report this hour on why all the tornado sirens went off all at once in Dallas this weekend. Did you hear about that? The emergency warning signals all over Dallas all went off in the middle of the night on Friday night when they were not supposed to. Wait until you hear why that happened. That story is absolutely nuts and that is coming up tonight. We`ve also got a report tonight on the special elections that are going to be held tomorrow in Kansas and next week in Georgia. These are elections to fill the congressional seats of these two Republicans who got bumped up from the House of Representatives to take positions in the Trump administration. These are both red districts in red states, but the Republican Party is freaking out about the prospect that these seats might be at risk in Kansas and Georgia. So, we`ve got that story ahead tonight as well. There`s a lot going on. But I want to start tonight with an intriguing piece of news out of Spain. Now, this is an FBI story, but the FBI is officially not commenting on it. So, I will tell you at the outset, we are sort of left to our own devices in terms of figuring out exactly what this means but one of the ways we can start to do that is at this website. This is a website called “Spamhaus”, which sounds like a delicious idea for a downscale retro Hawaiian fast-food place. But Spamhaus, s-p-a-m-h-a-u-s., spamhaus.org, it`s basically an online international clearinghouse for information and news and statistics and leads about the ways that people use the internet to commit crimes and steal stuff. It`s about spam and hacking and malware and viruses, all the means that people use to mount online attacks. And they have done their best at Spamhaus to try to make the worst spammers in the world very famous. Obviously, this is the sort of crime that you can commit without anybody ever laying eyes on you but Spamhaus has done their best to try to create a – you know, FBI style most wanted list first for spammers. Quoting from spamhaus.org, “Up to eighty percent of spam targeted at Internet users around the world is generated by a hardcore group of about 100 known persistent spam gangs whose names, aliases and operations are documented in Spamhaus` register of known spam operations database.” And they post that explanation right along what is basically their version of the ten most wanted list. Quote, “This top chart of spammers is based on Spamhaus` view of the highest threat, least repentant, most persistent, and generally the worst of the career spammers causing the most damage on the Internet currently.” So, with their top list. And if you need a pop up your patriotic pride a little bit, you`ve been worrying that maybe the United States of America is not holding our own when it comes to this technically adept corner of the criminal underworld, rest assured turns out we`re doing great. Of the top ten worst spammers in the world, seven out of the of them are USA, USA. Two of the 10 are from Ukraine and there`s one guy in the list who has been on that list for a long time who is Russian. And this is the news – the Russian guy just got arrested. He is known online as Peter Severa or just Severa. He`s also known as Peter Levashov. And according to spamhaus.org, he is a, quote, “spammer who writes and sells virus spamming spamware and botnet access. He`s probably involved in the writing and releasing of viruses and Trojans. He`s one of the longest operating criminal spam lords on the Internet.” The reason this kind of criminal arrest is now American politics news is because one of the things that we`ve all had to learn in reporting and understanding the story of the Russian government hacking our presidential election last year, one of the things we`ve had to get familiar with in terms of how the Russian government, the Russian military, the Russian intelligence services mount those kinds of attacks, we have had to learn about the overlap in Russia between criminal hacking – you know, hacking for profit, hacking just thievery – the overlap between that and Russian government intelligence work. I mean, yes, America is still king of the world when it comes to online criminal activity – hacking, spam, stealing and stuff. But Russia is pretty good too, and over the years, an unusual thing has emerged in the Russian government. The Russian intelligence services, including their military intelligence service, they have moved beyond just trying to tap bright young computer science undergrads to enlist and join the spy services they have moved beyond that sort of recruiting of people into the intelligence services from the computer world, and they instead have moved into the criminal part of the hacking world. They have taken great pains to co-opt the most successful criminal hackers and spam artists operating illegally in Russia. Rather than prosecute them, instead they use them. They essentially piggyback on that criminal activity and take over some of that criminal activity for their own purposes in Russian intelligence. So, Russian criminal hackers are stealing personal data and financial information from, for example, tens of millions hundreds of millions of users of yahoo.com. OK, fine, that`s a criminal act. They`re doing it for profit. But Russian intelligence then uses that hack to specifically target individual journalists and opposition figures who they want to go after for political reasons, for government reasons. That`s the way it works. And with this guy who just got arrested in Spain that particular overlap between criminal work and intelligence work for Russia, that overlap is very, very clear with him. As long ago as 2012, there was open source reporting in Russia that he had crossed over from just being a famous criminal hacker to working for the FSB, working for the successor agency to the KGB. He was reported to be making the pitch to other hackers in closed online communication forums, asking other hackers to do work on behalf of the Russian government, on behalf of the Russian spy service. Also, his own online criminal activity was implicated in a pro Putin Russian government operation. I`ll quote this part from today`s “New York Times”. Quote, “Peter Severa`s spam operation ran a sophisticated evolving family of computer viruses.” I`m going to mispronounce these but I`ll do my best – “a sophisticated evolving family`s computer viruses called Waledac and later Kelihos.” I have no idea if that`s how you say them. But look at this, quote, “The Kelihos virus had been devised to spread spam, but during the Russian election in 2012, it was used to send political messages to email accounts on computers with Russian IP addresses, and those emails linked to fake news stories saying that the businessman who was running for president against Vladimir Putin had come out as gay.” So, this guy was one of the most famous criminal spam kingpins in the world. These viruses and botnet operations that he`d built for his spam vampire apparently had made him fabulously wealthy. When “BuzzFeed News” wrote up this story today, they quoted a fellow Russian hacker as describing Peter Levashov as living a lifestyle so lavish, quote, “it would have embarrassed an oligarch.” So, he`s a top ten internationally listed criminal spam kingpin. He`s reported to have recruited other hackers online to work for the Russian intelligence service. His own viruses were put to work in a Russian election a few years ago, spreading fake news that Putin`s opponent was gay. And now, he`s been arrested in Spain and – get this – he was arrested in Spain at the request of the FBI. Hmm. And the FBI is not talking about why they wanted him arrested or what this is about. But in Russian language media reporting on this arrest today and in Spanish media reporting on this arrest today, because again the arrest was in Spain, multiple publications have run quotes from this guy`s wife who was with him in Barcelona when he got arrested and she says what he told her about why he was being arrested is that had it had to do with a computer virus that he had created that was related to Donald Trump winning the presidential election in the United States last year. So, this guy has been a known notorious spammer for years, for years. But he has traveled freely around the world. He has never been arrested that we know of. He has never behaved as if he feared arrest. Certainly, he never behaved as if he feared arrest by the FBI by traveling to a country that had an extradition treaty with the United States like Spain does. But he got picked up in Barcelona and now he`s in a Spanish prison because the FBI asked for Spanish authorities to pick him up. Why and why now? Should we believe these quotes from his wife who says that he told her his arrest had something to do with the U.S. election? We don`t know. The FBI will not say. For what it`s worth, the no comment that the FBI is giving on this story, it came from the criminal division of the FBI, not from the national security division of the FBI. So, maybe the origin of the no comment is significant in some way, I don`t know. But this does come at a time when some new pieces are starting to fall in place in terms of the pace and the scope and the focus of the investigation into the Russia attack and this crucial question of whether or not the Trump campaign was involved in that attack. “The Financial Times” reported last week that the FBI has now created a special unit in Washington to oversee all aspects of this investigation. It had previously been reported that the investigation was spread out among multiple FBI field offices all around the country. Apparently, they will now start operating out of a single unit in Washington. CBS has recently reported that although the FBI investigation didn`t start until July of last year, according to CBS, the focus of the FBI investigation has now shifted two months earlier than that. CBS reports that the FBI is now looking at the initial Russian hack of the Democratic Party which happened all the way back in March. They are reportedly looking into whether or not people associated with the Trump campaign might have helped direct that initial hack, might have helped protect – direct those Russian efforts as early as last March when the hacking and the stealing first started. In addition to that, on Thursday night, as the U.S. Navy launched Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian air base, one of the pieces of news that night that got kind of lost in the sauce as everybody covered that military strike, was word that the CIA had come across news about the Russian attack and about the Trump campaigns possible connections to that attack that the CIA apparently found very alarming last summer. According to “The New York Times”, in late August, CIA Director John Brennan was so concerned about what the CIA was seeing about increased evidence of Russia`s election meddling that he began a series of urgent individual briefings for eight top members of Congress.” Quote, “It is unclear what new intelligence might have prompted the classified briefings, but concerns were growing internally and publicly at the time about a significant Russian breach of the Democratic National Committee and the CIA – this is important – the CIA began seeing signs of possible connections to the Trump campaign.” “In an August 25th briefing for then-Senator Harry Reid, John Brennan indicated that unnamed advisors to Mr. Trump might be working with the Russians to interfere in the election.” So, the CIA thought that that was enough of a possibility that they needed to individually start briefing senior leadership in Congress, not just the Russian attack Trump involvement in the attack. So, I mean, in terms of division of labor and national security law here, the CIA can only handle the foreign part of this, right? The CIA can only handle the Russian attack part of this. When it comes to the possibility of the Trump campaign or any other Americans helping that effort, well, then you`re talking about Americans. That`s a domestic issue. That becomes an American law enforcement operation, right? And that sort of thing is not handled by the CIA. That has to be handled by the FBI. But this new reporting indicates that the CIA last summer somehow came into possession of information that it found sufficiently alarming that the director did one-on-one briefings with the leadership in Congress, not to tell them about Russia interfering at the election, but to tell them about Russia interfering with the election and the distinct possibility that Trump campaign, the Trump campaign was helping Russia do that. So, the Trump campaign side of that is something that the FBI would have to handle ultimately, not the CIA. And because of that, because that`s FBI territory at that point, the investigation becomes a black box to us in terms of what we know about it or at least in terms of what the FBI will say about it. But whether or not they are talking about these things, we can see what they`re doing. And one of the things they have just done is request the arrest of this Russian intelligence linked criminal mega hacker who is now sitting in a jail cell in Barcelona presumably about to be extradited to the United States. And the FBI won`t say beep about it. So, there`s a lot going on in the world right now. There`s a lot going on in politics. There`s a lot going on in the news that doesn`t look like politics until you`ve got to the surface a little bit. But as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson prepares to go to Moscow as this administration continues to enjoy its first real bout of shallow good press about their bombing two thousand percent of all the planes in Syria, the one potentially existential scandal of this administration really is still moving. Tonight, it`s moving in Barcelona. Tomorrow, who knows? Watch this space.",1,18438.0,3218.0,host,1.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
1,MADDOW," Tom DeLay really pioneered the genre. But you know, John Edwards was dazzling, too. Oh, and Rick Perry oh happy day Rick Perry. This is a thing for arrested politicians now. This is the way it`s done. When it`s time for your mug shot, sir, make sure you smile. I don`t know who trains politicians to take their mug shots like this, but Alabama Governor Robert Bentley clearly got the memo. Smile, sir. We have been covering the Robert Bentley story for months. We were the first national news outlet to spend significant time on this story. We were – we were on the Robert Bentley story even before the tape came out. I think – I`m not going to promise, but I think I can tell you – I think I can tell you this is the last time we`re ever going to play it. But, baby, let me tell you what we`re going to have to do, we`re going to have to start locking the door. If we`re going to do – if we`re going to do what we did the other day, we`re going to have to start locking the door.",1,981.0,195.0,host,2.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
2,MADDOW," I think that`s it. I think we are now officially – I was going to say we put that bed, but it`s like – there`s nothing, it pollutes all words that get anywhere near it. Anyway, I think we are done with that now, because today, this thing arrived at its inevitable political conclusion. The sex and ethics scandal that made Alabama Republican Governor Robert Bentley nationally famous. Today, it resulted in a plea deal, in which he pled guilty to two misdemeanor counts. He resigned as governor of Alabama. He pledged to never run for public office again. He agreed to pay back funds that he misused, and he will do many dozens of hours of unpaid community service. Now, it is possible that they could still try to put him in jail on the misdemeanors that he pled guilty to today, but nobody really expects jail time. Alabama`s basically a one-party state at this point. Republicans dominate all levels of government. Just over the course of one year, over the space of one year, the Republican speaker of the house was arrested convicted and sentenced to four years in prison on corruption charges. Not long after that, the elected chief justice of the state Supreme Court was thrown off the bench for violating judicial ethics and now today, smile the governor has resigned pled guilty and had his mug shot taken. As Lieutenant Governor Kay Ivey took the oath of office today, started to feel like there might be something poetic about the fact that a governor, you know, cheating on his wife of years and then using state funds and resources to cover it up, that that scandal in particular will now result in Alabama getting a woman governor for only the second time in the state`s history. But we may not be able to write the ending of this yet. This thing might not be over. Alabama political reporter John Archibald broke many of the biggest developments in this scandal from the very beginning and today as the governor resigned, Archibald says that now there may be other shoes to drop. The head of the Alabama law enforcement agency is implicated here. The utility company that was inexplicably paying the alleged mistresses salary, they are implicated here. Also, Luther Strange who Governor Robert Bentley appointed to a United States Senate seat right in the middle of this whole morass, there are now questions he`s going to have to answer. When Jeff Sessions became Donald Trump`s attorney general, it was Robert Bentley who appointed Jeff Sessions` successor in the Senate, and now, he may be all mixed up in this too. John Archibald is the Alabama reporter who busted this story open in the first place. He says this may not be over today just because the governor resigned today. John Archibald joins us from Alabama, next.",1,2741.0,481.0,host,3.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
3,BENTLEY," The time has come for me to look at new ways to serve the good people of our great state. I have decided it is time for me to step down as Alabama`s governor. I`m leaving this office that I have held, that I have respected, that I`ve loved for seven years to focus on other and possibly more effective areas of service.",1,320.0,64.0,guest,4.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
4,MADDOW," Now, former Alabama Governor Robert Bentley resigning from office today. I don`t know what he thinks his more effective areas of service are going to be, but as governor, he had ceased to be effective a long time ago when this sex and ethics scandal first broke in Alabama news. Joining us now is the man who more than anybody broke this story, John Archibald, columnist for “The Birmingham News”. He is reporting tonight that the resignation of the governor may not be the end of this story. Mr. Archibald, it`s really good to have you with us tonight. I`m sure it`s been a very busy day for you.",1,598.0,110.0,host,5.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
5,"JOHN ARCHIBALD, ALABAMAA MEDIA GROUP COLUMNIST"," Yes, it has. Thank you for having me.",1,38.0,9.0,guest,6.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
6,MADDOW," First of all, let me just ask about this the governor`s decision here. This was not a simple resignation. It was part of a plea deal. For people who haven`t been following the criminal part of this carefully, could she tell us sort of the distance between the charges he was facing and what he actually pled to today while he resigned?",1,336.0,63.0,host,7.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
7,ARCHIBALD," Sure. Last week, the Alabama ethics commission referred to prosecutors for charges which are all felonies, ethics charges and campaign violations which each carried a 20-year maximum prison sentence. So, going from there to two misdemeanors, it seems like a long way to fall. But there are other conditions and that`s why he was able to make that deal.",1,353.0,60.0,guest,8.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
8,MADDOW," And if – obviously, him resigning as governor, him pledging to never stand for public office again, him repaying some of the funds that he`s accused of misusing, there are a lot of – I mean, he`s paying a penalty here. Will this be a controversial plea deal in Alabama? Will people want him to have seen jail time? Will the people who made this deal with them have to answer for it?",1,383.0,74.0,host,9.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
9,ARCHIBALD," I think, initially, a lot of people are really upset honestly. It`s one of the strangest things. That this has been one of the most unifying things I`ve seen in Alabama in a long time, because Republicans, Democrats just about everybody looked at this and says this is crazy. He should have resigned long ago. So, I think there`s some anger initially that it`s not worse, but when people start to realize that the cost of the trial is going to be avoided and he really has lost everything, I think that people will probably be more forgiving.",1,543.0,99.0,guest,10.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
10,MADDOW," In terms of the knock-on effects here, it`s not just his career. One of the things that you were highlighting today when you rode up at AOL.com, when you rode up basically the overview of what happened today, is that there may be some other shoes to drop here. There is – there`s a lot of stuff that came out in that report that was – that was that was just released, in all those thousands of pages of exhibits. There is a utility company that seems to have explicably had the governor`s alleged mistress on its payroll. The head of Alabama law enforcement agency appears to have been sort of an insider in terms of this – the affair and maybe the efforts to cover it up. Do you expect that those things will be pursued?",1,722.0,138.0,host,11.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
11,ARCHIBALD," I think there will be some things pursued. I do think that ahead of their law enforcement agencies is particularly in trouble because he has painted time and time again by sworn testimony and witnesses as having had intimate knowledge of the affair, the text messages and such. But when he was immediately promoted ahead of law enforcement, he stood beside the governor and said that that – he had no knowledge of it, and he has continued that and it is inexplicable in trouble. There are others, Rebekah Mason, the aide, her husband will face some real scrutiny. And as you mentioned before, this will not wash off of Luther Strange.",1,635.0,113.0,guest,12.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
12,MADDOW, Luther Strange is obviously a law enforcement connection to this. He was the state attorney general when the governor appointed him to take Jeff Sessions seat in the United States Senate. Why might this be a problem for him?,1,225.0,40.0,host,13.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
13,ARCHIBALD," Well, we all know that it`s a difficult to unseat a sitting senator, but he was supposed to be a hit in charge of the investigation that was looking into Bentley and implored Alabama House of Representatives not to proceed with an impeachment because he was going to handle – because his office was going to handle it. Then, he immediately when Sessions seat became available went to the governor and parlayed that into an appointment as senator. And I just think he way underestimated how much Alabama will hold him responsible for that.",1,539.0,95.0,guest,14.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
14,MADDOW," John Archibald, columnist for “The Birmingham News” – again did more than anybody anywhere to break this story that has now resulted in the resignation of the governor. John, I know that this is still an ongoing reporting project for you. Thanks for letting us know and it`s weird to say congratulations on this, but as a repeat of reporting and journalism, you deserve a lot of the credit here, sir.",1,401.0,72.0,host,15.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
15,ARCHIBALD," Thank you, Rachel.",1,19.0,4.0,guest,16.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10

17,MADDOW," So, spring last year toward the end of the presidential primary season, city of Dallas started experiencing something weird. A mini outbreak of tampering with their highway signs. Roadside traffic warnings instead we`re turning into political messages.",1,253.0,38.0,host,18.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
18,REPORTER," This is the kind of information you`d expect to see posted on one of these traffic signs set up along I-30. But earlier today, the message on the same sign was urging voters to feel the burn. Wayne Cox is one of thousands of motorist who drove past what a three traffic signs that were broken into and hacked early this morning. Another sign on westbound on I-30 between Westmoreland and Cockrell Hill display the statement “Donald Trump is a shape-shifting lizard”.",1,467.0,83.0,guest,19.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
19,MADDOW," Hacking into roadsides. I know how that one ends, it`s still funny to see. Hacking into road signs to call Donald Trump a shape-shifting lizard is funny, right? But you can also see how that kind of hacking could potentially be dangerous. I should also mention it`s a felony. In the Trump is a shape-shifting lizard case, whoever was responsible for that, did it by actually physically breaking in to the highway signs, cutting open the locks on those signs and then reprogramming what they would say. I should say that the Dallas authorities never actually caught who did that last year but that was May of last year. Then on Friday night, this past Friday night, Dallas got hacked again, except this time, it was way worse, way louder and less funny.",1,753.0,134.0,host,20.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
20,MADDOW," If you were in Dallas, Texas, on Friday night between the hours of 11:40 p.m. and 1:20 a.m., this is what it sounded like everywhere. A calm, otherwise warm normal night suddenly interrupted by the sound of all – listen to that – all of 156 of the city`s emergency sirens going off simultaneously. These are emergency sirens that worn in the event of tornadoes or other big weather emergencies, but there weren`t tornadoes. There weren`t any wasn`t anything else going on that would warrant all these things going off. But all 156 of them started going off, almost continuously for an hour and a half. Ultimately, the only way officials could stop the sirens was basically to pull the plug on the whole system. 911 lines were flooded with a surge of calls from people who understandably were freaking out what`s the emergency, what`s the emergency. Initially, the city said it was a malfunction. But by Saturday afternoon, officials said actually it was a hack, but not a hack in the way we traditionally think of hacking. It was not a hack done remotely by a computer. In fact, the sirens are not operated by a computer-based system at all. They`re radio-controlled. They get turned on and off by radio transmissions, by sounds. According from “The Dallas Morning News”, it appears somebody took control of the frequency and transmitted the tones that turned on all 156 sirens across the city. Well, today, the city said the system was finally back up and running. All fixed. They are not discussing the details of how their infrastructure was targeted, but they do say they believe the attack on the sirens came from the Dallas area. They say, quote, “We are taking Friday night`s incident very seriously.” As for who might have done this, whether it was just a benign hack designed to point out a security weakness, or it was just done for fun or it was done with more malicious intent, we have no idea. Dallas PD and the FBI are both investigating. Joining us now is Xeni Jardin. She`s a tech culture journalist. She`s co-editor of Boing Boing and she`s an American hero. Xeni, it`s very nice to see you. Thanks for being here.",1,2132.0,376.0,host,21.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10

22,MADDOW," Oh, well – now let`s just end this here, it seems like we peaked. All right. Let`s – when I first heard this story, I assumed that it was a computer-based hack. When I heard that it was a sound based hack, the first thing that occurred to me was that this was – this is like the beginning of hacker school.

23,JARDIN," This is a OG hacking school. So, back in the day, back in the `80s and early `90s, hackers like Kevin Mitnick and a dude named Captain Crunch were you know taking the whistles out of Captain Crunch cereal boxes, and there`s some dual-tone multi-frequency DTMF. When you when you pick up a touch-tone phone, a landline phone and you touch the little numbers, you know, there`s two different tones. Well that`s an example of a tone that municipalities might use to say, turn on an emergency alert system, or control waters, or like a control the dam, or flood control systems. The idea of these systems is that they were they were pre-internet. Their radio broadcast. So, if there`s a legitimate emergency, they can`t be shut down. Let`s say, you know, all the power goes out, chances are that you can broadcast a sound to these alarms. And the reason that you had 156 of them going on for 90 seconds each different 15 times, nobody`s sure exactly how this was pulled off but they didn`t actually have to gain access to a computer. It seems like, according to the smartest tech forensic minds that I`ve spoken to, it seems like there was a combination of somebody having access to the codes, perhaps somebody in Dallas having access to the physical boxes, somebody knowing the exact frequencies, signs point to this. If not being an inside job, at least somebody having inside access.",1,1383.0,245.0,guest,24.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
24,MADDOW," And, Xeni, in terms of infrastructure hacks, obviously, we all learn about different kinds of hacking with every new news story that makes it more and more relevant to our lives, we`re all learning about, you know, Russian intelligence services and they`re hacking strategies, for example, because of Trump story. Is there a culture or subculture in hacking that`s specifically about showing off what you can do with infrastructure, that`s about embarrassing cities and embarrassing governments in terms of having old-school tech that they maybe aren`t protecting very well?",1,575.0,90.0,host,25.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10
25,JARDIN," Not only is there is subculture, it`s pretty much this is this is epic pawnage. You know this is like an epic hack. You woke everybody up. You freaked everybody out. So, in terms of pranks, you know, whoever pulled this off got good bragging rights. What`s frightening about this is that – well, first of all, as I recall it was the first night we began bombing Syria and who knows maybe people would have been frightened that they were in imminent endanger themselves. But even beyond the sort of emergency reaction that keep people could have when they`re frightened, what if this was the water system? What if it was the electricity system? Hacks like this are kind of their low probability, high impact event. And part of what`s tricky here is that we know that municipal governments in the U.S. spend very, very little of their I.T. budget if they even have an I.T. budget, on security. So big concerns now as the federal government is being – it`s being shrunk before our very eyes, what`s going to happen on the state and the local level in terms of protecting this very unsexy but high impact infrastructure? You know, in my opinion there should be a chief information security officer for every city in America that`s not going to happen. So, could we see maybe private public partnerships where large companies, you know, maybe someday at a Google or a Facebook will say, you know, we think that this part of the great ought to be protected, these kinds of arcane systems. Let`s create a new kind of security infrastructure. I don`t know how that will play out now under Trump, but you know, not all of the hacks are digital and not all of the infrastructure risks can be seen in terms of bridges that fall down.",1,1723.0,312.0,guest,26.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-10

33,MADDOW," Tom Price our nation`s new secretary of health and human services. He is also a walking, talking billboard advertising what it means to have conflicts of interest while you hold high government office. While heading a key congressional committee on health care, Tom Price traded in stocks in health companies, while he was sponsoring and voting on legislation that would affect the prices of those company`s stocks. He got special non-public deals from a foreign bio-tech firm where he got to buy his stock cheaper than the general public. He is accused of severely under-valuing his stock holdings on his financial disclosure forms. All of that was reported in the press before Senate Republicans voted to confirm him as health secretary in February. Since then, there`s only been more. The latest from “ProPublica”, who report now on the same day that his stockbroker bought him $90,000 worth of pharmaceutical company stock, Tom Price that same day, quote, “arranged a call to a top U.S. health official to try to convince that official to get rid of a rule that could have hurt the profits of that company.” This is not been good news for Tom Price and it keeps stacking up. I mean, the silver ling for us the American people in terms of not being deprived of honest services here, is that Tom Price can no longer get campaign donations from these industries that he has been serving so well now that he is no longer in Congress, right? You know who can, though? His wife. His wife is named Betty Price. She`s a state rep for Georgia`s 48th house district. Since her husband Tom Price was nominated to be the health and human services secretary, health companies from outside her state, certainly from outside her district have suddenly become very interested in her little house district and started flooding her with money. And it does open this new avenue of questioning as to whether it is appropriate for the wife of the health and human services secretary to continue to receive donations from the health care industry that her husband is now intimately involved with. And now, she is playing an active role in the special election to replace her husband in Georgia`s sixth congressional district. She`s just cut – Betty Price just cut a brand-new radio ad in support of Republicans in the upcoming election. The race, the race to replace Tom Price, the sixth congressional district in Georgia is getting a lot of national attention now in part because national players are intimately involved with the politics back home, but also because that race is one of the first tests of the Trump effect, right, what the nation`s reaction to trump looks like back home in these congressional districts that are about to start having special elections. Today, something practically unthinkable even just a few months ago, happened in that Georgia race. We`ve got more on that next.

34,MADDOW," Texas Senator Ted Cruz showed up at a surprising place today. Yingling aviation, which is a little add-on part of the regular airport in Wichita, Kansas, it`s a part where they land private planes, I think. Ted Cruz was there for a rally for a Republican who`s running in a special election tomorrow. When Republicans got the White House this year, one of the knock-on effects of that was that a bunch of lawmakers got pulled out of Congress and into the new administration. And now, their congressional seats are open. Now, these are all Republican seats in red states but Republicans are worried, actually a little bit about all of them, Kansas, South Carolina, Georgia, Montana, could Democrats take one of these congressional seats? Could they take more than one? Republicans are pouring in resources to try to stop that from happening. So, Ted Cruz, you were at Yingling Aviation for a day, trying to save a Kansas congressional seat that had been occupied before by Mike Pompeo, who is now running the CIA. Both President Trump and Vice President Pence sent robocalls into this Kansas district for tomorrow. The president won the district by 27 points. They should not have to help there. That Kansas race happens tomorrow. The next week, week from tomorrow, it`s Georgia. It`s an all-comers primary to fill the seat that used to be held by Tom Price. Congressman Price now secretary of health and human services. Look at the field of people trying to replace him. Look at this, 18 candidates all lumped together in the same list regardless of party. If anybody clears 50 votes of the vote, that person will win the seat outright. If not, the top candidates will compete in a runoff. The game here is that a bunch of Republicans could win. They`re all slugging it out for the same votes, but the Democrats have mainly coalesced around one candidate, a guy named Jon Ossoff. That relatively united support has Ossoff pulling way ahead of everybody, at 43 percent. He`s not at the 50 percent threshold, but he is not far off. His candidacy has been a lightning rod for Democratic energy around the country. He`s gotten a ton of national attention and support. He`s got over $8 million in his campaign war chest, which is bonanza money, for any congressional election, especially for a candidate nobody had ever heard of before this. And Republicans do seem a little bothered by the possibility that Jon Ossoff could actually win this thing outright a week from tomorrow. Trump won this district by less than two points. Well, now, in this special election, national Republicans have been pounding Jon Ossoff with attack ads, and mailers. They sent national Republican staffers to the district. They`re opening a new Republican field office. All of this to defend a Republican seat that they didn`t know before now they`d have to be defending. And look at this. We just got this today. Cook Political Report, gold standard of tracking elections at the granular level, they`ve been tracking these races from day to day, predicting how likely they are to tip in a certain direction. Today, Cook moved this Kansas race tomorrow towards the Democrats, moved it from likely Republican to just lean Republican. They moved the Georgia race to a toss-up. That seat hasn`t been held by a Democrat in nearly 40 years. No Democrat has held that seat since it went to Newt Gingrich in 1979. Now, Georgia says it`s a jump ball, toss-up. Early voting is already happening in that Georgia race. Polls open tomorrow morning at 7:00 in the Kansas special election. This is going to be fascinating to watch. We will bring you the Kansas returns tomorrow as we get them. That does it for us tonight. We`ll see you again tomorrow.

0,"RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC ANCHOR"," Good evening, Chris. Thank you, my friend. And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. We are, of course, watching the Pentagon closely right now. We are watching a golf club in south Florida closely right now because that`s where the president is tonight, at the first night of his major summit with the Chinese president. We`re also, of course, watching the Mediterranean Sea tonight and the Middle East closely. As we await word as to whether or not this brand new American administration is about to take major military action against the Syrian military. We will let you know as soon as we have any word either direction from the Pentagon or from any of those other locales that we are watching right now. We`ve got people on standby literally all across the globe tonight as we`re awaiting the furtherance of this news. But while we`re waiting to find out what the president is going to decide to do and how it`s going to work, it seems to me that there are basically two ways to view the proximate story, the proximate history of how we got here. The sort of two arcs of the story that led to this point. One of them I think starts in August 2013, in the suburbs of Damascus, when there was a massive, massive chemical weapons attack on two Syrian civilian neighborhoods. That was an attack by the Syrian government. They used chemical weapons. They used what was later determined to be sarin gas. That attack in August 2013 killed more than 1,400 civilians including hundreds of children. And the global response, the U.S. response, naturally, was absolute horror. Outrage. A clamor for a response of sufficient magnitude to match and dissuade and punish an attack that horrific by the Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad. Again, over 1,400 people killed in that gas attack in 2013. Now, in terms of the American response to that attack four years ago, the decision-making process in our government was very much colored by the fact that the previous year in 2012, President Obama had described the widespread use of chemical weapons as something that would be a red line in terms of the Syrian conflict. That would be a red line for the United States. Now, it`s one thing to say that, right, to lay that out as a hypothetical. It is another thing to still have to decide exactly what you`re going to do when that moment arrives in the future. And in August 2013, when that moment arrived, when that terrible massive chemical weapons attack happened, President Obama prepared U.S. navy ships in the Mediterranean to launch cruise missile strikes against Syrian military targets as retaliation. If that sounds familiar, it`s because that`s what we are being advised tonight, that the U.S. military may be making similar preparations this evening. But back in 2013, though, when President Obama got those Tomahawk missiles ready on those Navy ships in the Mediterranean, he ended up not using them, he ended up deciding to proceed in two ways. He asked the U.S. Congress to vote to authorize the use of military force in Syria. There had been this clamber in Congress that the United States must respond with military force. President Obama said, OK, authorize the use of military force then, whereupon Congress suddenly got very quiet and never acted on that. At the same time, a new path opened up in the wake of the gas attack in 2013, a new opportunity that was brokered internationally, chiefly with Russia, to take away Syria`s chemical weapons. So, the practical consequence of that massive gas attack in 2013 was, yes, the threat of U.S. military force, U.S. Congress deciding that they didn`t want to decide about military force, and an international agreement, practical effort to take Syria`s chemical weapons away from Bashar al Assad and destroy them in a verifiable way. Russia, of course, is Bashar al Assad`s greatest ally. Russia said they would be the guarantor of that progress. They would be the ones who would agree to make sure, they would step up for Assad, they would step up for Syria, and guarantee that Assad would not hide any of his chemical weapons, he would not cheat in that agreement. And in fact, thousands of tons of Syrian chemical munitions were destroyed. But now, it is 3 1/2 years later and we haven`t had another attack on the scale of what we saw back in 2013 with over 1,400 people killed and hundreds of children killed in a sarin attack, but there was some kind of gas attack. There was some kind of chemical attack on Syrian civilians again, this week, on Tuesday of this week. And you have probably read or heard over the last few days, you`ve probably read or heard certainly today that what happened in Syria this week was a sarin attack. That it was the same chemical weapon used in the Damascus suburbs 3 1/2 years ago. You know, that may yet turn out to be true, but right now, it is a matter of investigation, international chemical weapons experts right now are trying to determine for sure whether or not sarin was used in this attack on Tuesday. The only declaration from any official body on this point yet was a statement from the Turkish health ministry today. They said it was sarin, but that`s the Turkish health ministry. There`s to reason necessarily to take them as the international standard on this kind of assessment. It`s worth noting for context that the Turkish government very much would like to get rid of Bashar al Assad. They are not a neutral party in terms of the Syrian conflict. So, while we await some sort of more determinative assessment as to whether or not this was sarin. This attack this week undeniably was horrific and was an attack on civilians. The U.S. military says – two U.S. Pentagon officials telling NBC News today that the attack was launched by U.S. – sorry, by Syrian military planes. Fixed-wing Syrian military aircraft were seen dropping the bombs that then civilians responded to as if it was a gas attack. The death toll is thought to be over 70. Dozens of children were killed. Well, in addition to the immediate horror of that attack on Tuesday, there`s also this overarching question of whether this really might have been sarin or might have been some other chemical weapon. There`s a question of whether this means that Syria did cheat that international process that was designed to rid them of chemical weapons, the prospect that Russia didn`t actually guarantee Syria`s compliance with the international effort to destroy all their chemical weapons. It`s possible now we realize that Bashar al Assad retains that capacity and proved this week that he was unafraid to use it against his civilian population. So, that`s – that`s sort of one story arc in terms of how we got here. That`s one way to understand the proximate history of how we got to this place that we`re in tonight, where we`re hearing from the Pentagon tonight that once again the U.S. military may be readying military strikes in Syria, may specifically be readying U.S. missile strikes from U.S. Navy vessels right now that are in the Mediterranean. So, that is – that`s one way to get there. That`s a history largely of the previous administration intertwines with the moderate history of this terrible Syrian civil war. That`s one way. Another way to see this, there`s another lens, at least, through which you can view this, a different arc of recent events that bridge brings us to tonight. That`s the story specifically of this current administration. This new administration who`s making the decisions now on this issue. This is a very young administration. They had a very difficult transition. They had a very hard time doing just the basic work of keeping government up and running between the last administration and the new one. There are roughly 550 key administration positions that need to be confirmed by the Senate. To this day, this administration has not even nominated anyone for more than 500 of those 550 positions. At the Department of Defense, there`s precisely one person on staff in the entire Pentagon who has been Senate confirmed in this new administration. That`s the secretary of defense, Jim Mattis. Other than that, they got no one through the Senate confirmation process. Same goes at the Department of State, there`s one person at the State Department who`s been confirmed by the Senate, that is the secretary of state and he`s the only one. At the National Security Council and in the White House, national security matters have not been handled in a way that is impressive. This new administration made history when they fired their first national security adviser after only 24 days on the job. He was fired because of lying about his contacts with the Russian government. It was only later determined after he was fired that he had also secretly been on the payroll of the government of Turkey. He`s now requesting immunity in response – excuse me, in exchange for his testimony on the Trump/Russia investigation. The first person the new administration named as a deputy national security adviser to Michael Flynn was basically unhired from that position before she was ever really on the job. The second person who was named to be a deputy national security adviser to Michael Flynn technically, she still holds her job but she`s rumored to be on her way to Singapore to become the new ambassador to Singapore basically against her will because they want her out of there now, too, but haven`t figured out how to get her out yet. Mike Flynn`s replacement as national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, tried apparently to fire the National Security Council senior director for intelligence who`s a 30-year-old guy who had been brought in to the National Security Council by Mike Flynn. The White House intervened to stop that firing. They stopped the national security adviser from having his own chosen senior director for intelligence and they instead insisted that that young man who came in with Mike Flynn, he had to stay on at that job. Subsequently, that young man was one of two Trump National Security Council staffers who became involved in this bizarre plot to feed sensitive intelligence information out of the National Security Council to Congressman Devin Nunes in what appears to have been an effort to divert the various investigations into the Trump/Russia connections during the campaign. That scheme today resulted in Chairman Nunes recusing himself from the Trump/Russia investigation on the House Intelligence Committee that he chairs. He`s now under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for potentially having leaked classified information in the middle of whatever that scheme was. And whatever you think about Devin Nunes and his role in that, what do you think about the National Security Council being used for that in this administration? The National Security Council`s a very important thing. We`ve had it since 1947. The main purpose of the National Security Council is to provide the best possible information to the president for the purpose of him making decisions on national security matters. The National Security Council is supposed to sift through various sources of information, various arguments on important national security matters and help the administration arrive at a consensus view – a clear, unified view that integrates everybody in the U.S. government into an all for one effort when it comes to making important national security decisions. When it comes to war and peace, when it comes to defending the United States, when it comes to life and death decisions where we work with and sometimes confront other countries, the United States government must speak clearly, directly, consistently, and with one voice. That has been a difficult achievement in this administration, and it`s a worrying piece of context for what appears to be tonight a decision by this administration as to whether or not they may rapidly increase their military involvement in Syria. I`m told that we are getting breaking news now. That we`re alerted now that this decision may be under way. I`m joined now by my colleague, Brian Williams, here in the studio.",1,12121.0,2067.0,host,1.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
1,"BRIAN WILLIAMS, MSNBC ANCHOR"," Rachel, thanks. And we are just learning from our producers at the Pentagon that there has been a sizable launch of Tomahawk cruise missiles tonight. We`re told over 50 of them in a single volley hitting targets on the ground in Syria. Our correspondent, Hans Nichols, is ready to tell us what they`ve been told at the Pentagon – Hans.",1,336.0,61.0,guest,2.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
2,"HANS NICHOLS, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT"," We`re still learning more on this. Here`s what we know. There have been Tomahawk cruise missiles fired off Navy ships in the eastern Mediterranean. They had a single target. That target was an airfield near Homs, which is a major commercial city. It was an airfield. It looks like there are more than 50 impacts. It just looks like the Tomahawks were fired. The goal there might have been to pock up the runway, maybe take out some Syrian aircraft. We`re learning more as we speak but this launch has happened against the regime of Syria`s President Bashar al Assad. This marks an escalation in an already very complicated war. We`ll get back to you when we have more information – Brian.",1,689.0,123.0,guest,3.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
3,WILLIAMS," OK. Hans, just one more point here. In the Mediterranean, I believe we have the USS Porter and USS Ross that would be ready to fire missiles like this, even though all of our vessels over a certain size and certainly all of our nuclear submarines are potential launching platforms. How big, how small is a volley of 50 of these considering we`re talking about a thousand-pound warhead on each?",1,394.0,71.0,guest,4.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
4,NICHOLS," A thousand-pound warhead is what they can carry. The fact they were just Tomahawks and didn`t include any fixed-wing bombings gives you an indication, Brian, that this is a proportional response. You know, when there had been talk about this leading up to, there had been a range of options the Pentagon had been preparing. Far end of the range, disabling the entire Assad air force. It looks like they didn`t go in that direction. It looks like President Donald Trump ordered a more proportional response, it came from the two ships you mentioned in the Eastern Med, just Tomahawks. Now, we want to find out if there are ally conversations with U.S. allies in the counter-ISIL regime, and crucially if there`s a conversation with the Russians. Remember, there`s a deconfliction hotline going on right now for the fight against ISIS. That`s the other enemy and adversary in Syria and the Russians and U.S. counterparts speak all the time on that hotline. Whether or not the Russians were given a heads-up, any sort of tip, that`s another thing we`ll be looking for. We also don`t know if there have been any casualties on the ground, if there`s been anything like that. We can report the strike happened, it happened moments ago and it appears it`s over, this appears to be a one-off strike. But President Trump making good in restoring this idea of crossing red lines, doing something President Barack Obama didn`t do and that is attack the regime of Bashar al Assad – Brian.",1,1477.0,256.0,guest,5.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
5,WILLIAMS," So, Hans, I understand you`re limited to what we know. Far from regime change, far from targets all over that country, this could turn out to be a strike on the air facilities where it`s believed the sarin gas, suspected sarin gas, air strike started.",1,252.0,46.0,guest,6.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
6,NICHOLS," Yes, we don`t know the source of the sarin gas. We haven`t confirmed that it`s sarin gas, but this would be the airfield from which the fixed-wing aircraft that U.S. radar clearly saw hit that building about 72 hours ago, this is the airfield that they took off from. That gets back to this idea of proportionality. Now, I know we heard from Secretary Mattis earlier today talking about the idea under way being an effort for regime change or a transition of power for Assad. This doesn`t seem to be a strong hint that the U.S. is militarily going to go in the direction of regime change. This seems like it`s a proportional response. And also think we should note, Brian, the speed with which this happened, the velocity of this response. Just 72 hours ago on Tuesday morning, dawn in Syria, that`s when this chemical weapons attack happened, 72 hours later, there`s a response from this administration – Brian.",1,913.0,162.0,guest,7.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
7,WILLIAMS," All right. Hans Nichols at the Pentagon, we`re going to let him go report and see what more we can find out about this, again, this volley of cruise missiles launched tonight from U.S. Navy vessels onto land targets in and around the city of Homs in Syria, specifically aviation targets, we`re told. That could change – airfields, aircraft on airfields and the like. Kristen Welker is at the White House tonight. Kristen, what will we hear, if anything, from the building behind you or from the traveling White House in Florida?",1,529.0,93.0,guest,8.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
8,"KRISTEN WELKER, NBC NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESOPNDENT"," I anticipate we will hear something from the traveling White House, Brian. President Trump, of course, meeting with the president of China this evening. The two had dinner. Vice President Mike Pence, I can tell you, had been meeting with his staffers here inside the West Wing. No word an specifically what those conversations have revolved around, but clearly the key topic of conversation here at the White House has been Syria and trying to determine what those next steps will be. And now, of course, we have our answer to that question. This is President Trump`s first biggest major foreign policy crisis and test, Brian, and it also marks a shift in tone in terms of how the president has discussed and thought about intervention in Syria. Just several days ago, his secretary of state said it`s up to the people of Syria to determine the future of Bashar al Assad. We heard him change that stance today, Brian. The secretary of state now saying essentially that Assad cannot stay in power and that the United States is working on a political solution with its allies abroad. And that was a point echoed by President Trump who made it very clear yesterday in the Rose Garden during a press conference that he was horrified by the images that he saw coming out of Syria in the wake of that chemical weapons attack. He described his devastation over that and described the need to take some type of action. And so, again, tonight, we are seeing that shift here in policy. You`ll recall back in 2013 when then-President Obama was weighing his options in Syria, Mr. Trump at the time urged him not to take action. So, this really marks a shift in tone now that he is the one in the West Wing, in the White House. Again, he`s traveling right now, Brian, and of course, the White House travels with him. So, he`s undoubtedly huddling with his top advisers there as we anticipate his reaction which I suspect will detail the specific steps he took tonight and what we can expect moving forward, Brian.",1,2001.0,357.0,guest,9.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
9,WILLIAMS," All right. Kristen Welker, thanks. And we expect as Kristen pointed out, we expect more from the Pentagon, more from the traveling White House in Florida.

10,MADDOW," One of the things that has been, I think, worrying about the new administration is the way their National Security Council has been so much influx. The role of the National Security Council is to coordinate, bring about a whole of government effort, unified message and a stable message, particularly on volatile issues in national security. And for whatever reason, we really haven`t seen that. We saw over the course of one week, Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, we saw him turn 180 degrees on whether or not the fate of Bashar al Assad should be decided by the Syrian people or whether it should be something that the United States should take responsibility for as he indicated today. We`ve seen a similar U-turn from U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. Those changes were not in concert. They were not made at the same time. Today, the message from president, himself, was that maybe something should happen, essentially. So, it`s been – the messaging, the language around these issues has been sort of all over the place and I think it`s led to some worries about the decision-making process is around things like this. Clearly tonight, a decision has been made.",1,1168.0,201.0,host,11.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
11,WILLIAMS," And Tillerson`s words were so strong today, there was a walk back on background after he finished speaking.",1,108.0,19.0,guest,12.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
12,MADDOW, Yes. And that shouldn`t happen on the same day that you`re making a decision about military strikes.,1,101.0,18.0,host,13.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
13,WILLIAMS, That`s right.,1,14.0,3.0,guest,14.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
14,MADDOW," I mean, ideally, you would want to have not just – not just a whole of government effort, but you would want to have such discipline around your message and around your rollout, especially a unilateral strike you decide on your own terms. But, you know, helter-skelter. You roll with it, it`s the now reality. This administration will be I think as surprising on national security matters as they are on everything thus far. We`re joined now by retired U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis. He`s the dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Admiral Stavridis, thank you very much for being with us tonight. Can you shed some light for us on the strategic decision to do this with Tomahawk missiles? These ship-fired missiles. Some of the other options they may have considered, what are the advantages of doing it this way?",1,850.0,148.0,host,15.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
15,"ADMIRAL JAMES STAVRIDIS, U.S. NAVY (RET.)"," I think they made the right call in terms of doing something proportional, something relatively immediate, something that connects very much with the chemical strike, itself. What this tells you, Rachel, is that they wanted to take a low-risk profile. We didn`t take manned aircraft. And the fact the strikes weren`t directed against anti-air systems, which is what you would do, knock those down if you were going to send in manned aircraft later, tells you that probably we`ve seen a volley. We`re now going to take a pause, reset, follow the conversation, push the Russians, send the message. This is a conservative, a proportional, and I think a fairly correct response to what we`ve seen thus far. We`re going to know a lot more in a couple of hours as we hear statements coming from the president and the Pentagon, but I`m confident there will not be another wave. This is not shock and awe over Baghdad. This is more like 1998 when we launched a bag of cruise missiles at bin Laden in Afghanistan after the East African bombings.",1,1037.0,182.0,guest,16.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
16,MADDOW," Admiral Stavridis, stay with us for moment. I`d love to ask you. Just stand by. We`re going to go back to the Pentagon briefly for a second. Hans Nichols, our correspondent there. I believe, Hans, you have additional information in terms of what happened tonight.",1,264.0,46.0,host,17.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
17,NICHOLS," Yes, Rachel, we`re getting a little more confident on the number of Tomahawk cruise missiles that were fired. It`s about 60 and they hit both aircraft and infrastructure on that air base near Homs. It`s the latest from here. You know, taking a step back on this, given all our reporting earlier today, this does seem like a smaller version of the variety of options that were presented to President Trump. Remember, the big option was actually taking out the entire air force of Bashar al Assad. So, it looks like they went for the smaller one. A couple things that we need to figure out here. Number one, were allies informed? Number two, was Congress informed? Was it just the Gang of Eight? What sort of back and forth? And then, ultimately, what led President Donald Trump to use force against a sovereign country, against the government that although there are problems with it, it is the elected government of Syria. There could be some legal questions. We suspect they will argue on the doctrine to protect, the responsibility to protect. But what legal authority did the U.S. have going in there, launching these cruise missiles? And remember, there are Russian forces that are working closely with the Syrian regime and you have close to a thousand U.S. troops, about 500 special forces that we know of, they move other troops in and out of, they`re fighting a separate fight against ISIS, but there are a lot of U.S. troops in there that could potentially be targets if the regime is still inclined. This could get very messy. We still need to figure out all the details. As of now, both aircraft and infrastructure were hit. Tomahawk cruise missiles. And the strike is now over. This was a single target all on the airfield – guys.",1,1743.0,308.0,guest,18.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
18,MADDOW," Hans, let me just ask you one clarifying question in terms of who was notified, who was in on this. One of the things Admiral Stavridis just mentioned there was the issue of the Russian government, obviously, the most important ally to the Assad regime, and also a big military presence on the ground in Syria. Do we know if the Russians were given a heads-up about this?",1,372.0,69.0,host,19.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
19,NICHOLS," We do not. All we know on that, Rachel, is there is this deconfliction line that is used quite frequently because both American aircraft and Russian aircraft are fighting ISIS and more of the eastern part of the country. This strike took place more in the western part of country, just off sort of the border with Libya, close to Latakia, where, of course, the Russians, themselves, have a big air base. But most of the deconfliction talks that take place, these are daily conversations saying we have a plane up in this area, you have a plane up in this area. It`s designed to avoid any sort of friction or frankly escalating incidents between the United States and Russia. We don`t know if that deconfliction line was used on this strike – Rachel.",1,750.0,135.0,guest,20.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
20,MADDOW," Hans Nichols for us at the Pentagon. I believe we got one picture. It`s not a live picture. It would be sort of a conceptualizing picture of al-Shayrat airfield. This is what we were told is the target tonight. This is, of course, not post-bombing, not if 60 Tomahawk missiles were launched at it. But this is the image we`ve got of that site. Again, close to the Syrian city of Homs, which is the city we`ve read a lot about in terms of our coverage of the fighting in the Syrian civil war. What Hans Nichols just reported from the Pentagon is that infrastructure at that airfield was hit and also aircraft were hit. The Syrian air force is a considerable force. It`s used for targets in the north of Syria. But this is what we believe the targets – this is what we believe the target was of this major U.S. strike. We`re going to bring back in the conversation Admiral Stavridis. Admiral, looking at that site, what we know about that location, the fact this was one site that was targeted apparently with pretty massive number, dozens of these missiles, what would be the strategic goal, how much destruction would that sort of rain down on a site like this to hit it with all those missiles?",1,1196.0,221.0,host,21.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
21,STAVRIDIS," It is a significant strike but one that is limited geographically as you point out, Rachel. I would put this very much in the category of sending a signal to the Assad regime and to the Russians and oh, by the way, to the Iranians as well that we are not going to hesitate to use force, that we have, in fact, shifted back to what I would argue is the appropriate position, that Assad is a war criminal. We have to undermine him at every step and try and get him out of power. But this is a signal we have sent. I think what`s really interesting is going to be, what do we do now? What I would hope the administration will do is go to the Russians, say we`re serious, you cannot continue to support Assad as a client. There`s more firepower where this came from to say the least. And that we are very, very committed to ending Assad`s control in Syria. If you`re going to do that, you need a plan “B”, and that is what one would hope the administration`s doing now. That probably looks like building a Syrian opposition in a serious way in the eastern part of the country, supplying it, creating safe zones. Working with the Turks to provide that kind of operationalization in the north. And, I would argue, over time, diplomatically, with the Russians working on a solution. Much has happened in the Balkans in the 1990s. Frankly, Rachel, I think Syria as a nation is probably going to have to be partitioned or broken apart. That`s the longer-term strategy. This initial strike is the first step in sending a signal.",1,1519.0,283.0,guest,22.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
22,MADDOW," Admiral James Stavridis, very helpful to have you with us here tonight, sir. Thank you for your time. Appreciate your insight into this. Brian?",1,144.0,25.0,host,23.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
23,WILLIAMS," Also standing by with us retired Army Four-Star General Barry McCaffrey. He is in Seattle tonight. And, General, welcome. Given the limited target selection of this mission, what do you think the objective is of blowing up this one air facility?",1,246.0,42.0,guest,24.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
24,"GEN. BARRY MCCAFFREY, NBC NEWS MILITARY ANALYST"," I think Admiral Stavridis put it very nicely. There`s a lot of political importance to what just happened. There will be a direct devastating impact on the air units that were involved. There may well have been Russians on that airfield, by the way. I`m sure they would have pre-coordinated the strike with the Russians. Not giving them too much time to react. But at the end of the day, Brian, look, a half million people have been killed in Syria. There are literally a dozen brutal warring factions. There have been multiple chemical attacks since the famous Obama red line. Assad`s entire sect, the Alawite, and their associated allies, the Christians, Jews and others, know they`re going to be slaughtered if they lose this fight. I`m always uncomfortable about signaling political intent with military power. You never know where it`s going to go. In this case, it clearly – the military aspect is nominal at best.",1,921.0,158.0,guest,25.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
25,WILLIAMS," So, where does this leave us? If you are the Assad government looking and wondering?",1,85.0,16.0,guest,26.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
26,MCCAFFREY," Well, I think the best thing to come out of it is the Russians say, oh, my gosh, we`ve gone too far. Now, you know, we`ve got to underscore the fact the U.S. air force and U.S. naval air power is to significant and capable compared to the Russian presence in general, never mind their deployed strength in Syria, they are very unlikely to want to take us on in direct combat. They may well now have to think through I wonder if we ought to walk away from Assad. But I cannot imagine – they`re on the wrong side of this argument, by the way. They`re supporting a Shiite minority presence inside Syria. They`re allying themselves with Iranian guards, Hezbollah, militia. They`re on the wrong side of this fight. There`s a lot of Sunni Muslims in the world particularly living near Russia. So, I think Putin`s way out over his skis on this one. It may well be that it causes him to rethink their support for Assad. We`ll see.",1,923.0,172.0,guest,27.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
27,WILLIAMS," And with your familiarity of a kind of target package like this, or this specific target, let`s call it 60 of these, half a million dollars a throw, 18 feet long. I`m guessing we have cratered the runway and the taxiways. I`m guessing since it`s a military air base, they have those protected kind of bunkerized, hardened hangars. But I`m guessing we`ve struck all of those and any visible aircraft on the ground.",1,414.0,74.0,guest,28.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
28,MCCAFFREY," Well, we all love the Tomahawk. They`ve been improved dramatically since the first time I watched them used during Desert Storm. They are now incredibly lethal, low-risk, non-jammable option. They`re not a very good runway cratering device. The air force has got some incredible weapons to do that. So they would have tried to knock out all the aircraft they could find. They would have gone after the command and control. But Admiral Stavridis makes an important point. They weren`t used in the obvious prep session to take out air defense missiles and radar systems as phase one of a major strike with air power. So, so far, this is a signal to Assad and the Russians, we`ve had it. But, again, the background of the conflict, most of Syria has been destroyed, self-propelled artillery, tanks, brutal murders of innocent civilians. So, you know, one could sort of question why the sudden chemical warfare strike would prompt a total change in U.S. national security policy.",1,976.0,166.0,guest,29.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06

30,MADDOW," All right. We`re going to bring in Bill Neely now. Bill Neely, NBC global correspondent. And he is in Moscow tonight, which is a particular and interesting place from which to be watching these developments. Bill, what can you tell us tonight about Russian reaction, if any, to this young news of these big strikes?",1,316.0,56.0,host,31.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
31,"BILL NEELY, NBC NEWS CHIEF GLOBAL CORRESPONDENT"," Yes, good evening, Rachel. Well, it is 4:30 in the morning, so no official reaction here in Moscow. But interestingly, just before news of those air strikes was confirmed, Russia`s ambassador at the U.N. warned the United States that military action in Syria would result in negative consequences. Now that I suppose is to be expected from the Russians. Remember also that these 50 or so Tomahawk cruise missiles will have flown over the Russian air bases, the naval base at Tartus and the main airfield south of Latakia. They were flown at relatively low altitude and tracked by the Russians and by their S300 radar installations. We don`t know yet, crucially, what one U.S. official told NBC News and this, indeed, has not been confirmed, but we don`t yet know if the U.S. warned Russia in any way about what it was going to do and, indeed, warned the Russians to get any air crews that it might have at that airfield near Homs out of harm`s way. We don`t know that yet.",1,973.0,175.0,guest,32.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06

34,MADDOW," In terms of the Russian exposure here, you mentioned the Russian base there. Obviously, when, you know, Syrian fighter jet pilots are in the sky, they`re flying Soviet-made, Russian-made planes, right? There`s -- that`s the anti-aircraft defenses that they`ve got and they`re considerable. Those S-200, S-300 missile defense systems and aircraft defense systems. Those are all Russian-made. But what about Russian personnel? In the United States, we have to worry about force protection efforts for our own 500 to 1,000 service members who are on the ground in Syria. Russia, obviously, has a large number of their own personnel on the ground there. Is there – is the deconfliction process something that would be expected to protect them as well?",1,748.0,121.0,host,35.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
35,NEELY," Absolutely right. Those are the two key differences between President Trump`s decision now and President Obama`s decision in 2013. When Obama was weighing this up, there were no U.S. grounds on the troop in Syria and there were no Russians. Now for the last 18 months, we have both American bombing and of course large numbers of American – of Russian troops on the ground. The last time I was in Aleppo, for example, there were Russian foot patrols out on the streets. The Russians and Syrians are intermingled all over Syria, at air bases, at installations. They are advising the Syrians. There are thousands of Russian troops there. So, obviously, the danger with the United States which does not want a wider war, certainly not with Russia, is the dangerous of Russian military casualties.",1,794.0,136.0,guest,36.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
36,MADDOW," NBC News global correspondent Bill Neely on the ground for us tonight, 4:30 in the morning Moscow time – Bill, thank you very much. Really helpful to have you here with us. Here in studio with us in New York, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Adam Schiff of California. Congressman, it`s good to have you here tonight.",1,351.0,62.0,host,37.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
37,MADDOW," We never know exactly what within your remit of the intelligence committee is going to be the subject or discussion tonight. Obviously, it`s this news that the United States has launched nearly 60 Tomahawk cruise missiles, apparently from ships in the Mediterranean, targeting a Syrian air base on the western side of that country. Let me first get your reaction, find out how much you know about this.",1,403.0,69.0,host,38.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
38,SCHIFF," Well, I received a call from the director of national intelligence not long I think after the missiles were on their way and he has cleared me to share this. It was I think close to 70 missiles fired from ship at a single target. That target was the airfield where it`s believed that the chemical weapons attack originated from. It is, I think, at the present not the intention to have more than this single strike, but, of course, the administration is reserving their options depending on whether the regime responds against our troops or takes any other action against the U.S. targets or allies. But it was our best intelligence per the director that this is where the attack, the chemical weapons attack originated from and that was the response.",1,752.0,133.0,guest,39.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
39,MADDOW," When you say this is where the chemical weapons attack originated from, meaning that Syrian aircraft that dropped munitions that appear to be chemical weapons munitions on Tuesday, that`s the field they took off from?",1,218.0,36.0,host,40.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
40,SCHIFF," That`s the field, as well as apparently some facilities involved in creating the chemical munitions that would go on that aircraft. This, of course, isn`t the first chemical weapons attack by the regime and, you know, one of the concerns that I have about the action tonight – I certainly think it was on the range of military options, one of the more limited options. It didn`t utilize aircraft. There wasn`t the risk of loss of life of our pilots. They also evidently did everything they could to vet the site to make sure there wouldn`t be human casualties, wouldn`t be Russian casualties. But it is obviously a very abrupt change of course by the administration from just a few days ago when they said basically it`s up to the Syrian people to decide who will remain the leader of Syria, as if the Russians, the Iranians, Hezbollah, weren`t involved. And, of course, this wasn`t the first time we`ve seen those terrible images, but it was the first time we got a sense that the president recognized the gravity of his office because those were very much the same kind of photos President Obama was confronted with and, of course, President Trump had a very different reaction when he wasn`t the commander in chief, now he is. But, you know, I would certainly strongly caution the administration not to make this a military effort to change the regime. Now, I fully concur that the regime has to go, because as long as Assad is there, that fighting is going to go on, that terrible war is going to go on. But this is not something that can be accomplished via the air at a standoff location. At most, we can hope that this will deter the regime from using chemical weapons again. That is probably the most significant thing you could hope for as well as a deterrent to other regimes in the future by using chemical weapons. But there are still a lot of issues to be resolved and one of them for the Congress is all of this is being done, not just the attack today, but the presence of our troops there, all of this is being done without any congressional vote, any congressional authorization and Congress really needs to deal with this.",1,2141.0,387.0,guest,41.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
41,MADDOW, Was this – was this strike legal?,1,34.0,8.0,host,42.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
42,SCHIFF," Well, I did ask the director that question. What`s the legal basis for this? What`s the U.S. legal basis and what`s the international legal basis? That was out of his lane as I thought it might be, that`s really not directly responsibility of the DNI. But that`s a question Congress needs to ask. But I think we already know the answer to the question in terms of U.S. law and that is none of what we`re doing in Syria is authorized and this is an issue I took with the Obama administration. I introduced the AUMF that would authorize the use of force against ISIS and al Qaeda. I`m going to be reintroducing that after the recess. But even that authorization, even the argument the Obama administration used that the pre-existing authorizations were broad enough to go after ISIS in Syria, that rationale doesn`t hold up. Even if it did, it wouldn`t extend to attacks like this one on the regime.",1,898.0,162.0,guest,43.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
43,MADDOW," If the administration sees this as a standalone, one-off strike, that this isn`t the first in an escalating military campaign, you seem to indicate that was the gist of the message tonight that you got from the director of national intelligence. Does that effect whether or not it`s legal? Does a one-off strike require a different amount of authorization from the Congress legally speaking than an escalating campaign?",1,420.0,69.0,host,44.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
44,SCHIFF," No. I mean, the Congress should still be involved in the authorization even of a single attack of this magnitude. There may be a legal rationale that the White House offers that, well, these chemical weapons were a threat to our own troops. They could have been used against our troops. That`s a tough argument to make I think here. Then, of course, there`s the challenge of making the argument under international law for the intervention. That`s a problem that the Obama administration was similarly wrestling with. But it`s really clear, I think what the congressional obligation is here, and that is we still need to have a vote on whether we should be using military force at all in Syria. And, unfortunately over the last several years, there`s been this terrible confluence of interest between then the Obama administration, which didn`t want to have to devote the political muscle to getting that through the Congress, and a Congress that didn`t want to have to vote on it. A few of us, you know, have been trying, Tim Kaine, myself and a handful of others, but we`ve never been able to generate sufficient political will to actually force a vote on this.",1,1164.0,203.0,guest,45.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
45,MADDOW," Congressman, let me ask you to go back to the initial point that you raised which is the decision-making process that led to this. Obviously, this does represent a major shift in course by the administration. Not just to escalate to military force, but to strike against the Syrian regime at all. As you mentioned last week, the secretary of state was saying a week ago today the secretary of state was saying it`s up to the Syrian people whether or not Assad must go. We also had the U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley saying last week that the United States is not looking to bring about regime change. The president, himself, faced with previous chemical weapons attacks by Bashar al Assad had said there should be no invasion, should be no U.S. military force in response. There has been a 180-degree turn that has – that was not signaled for very long, that came about very, very rapidly. What is your perception of why that happened, what are your concerns about that? Is it possible that this attack on Tuesday was just so egregious that it was worth throwing out the entire previous strategy and inventing a new one on the spot?",1,1130.0,203.0,host,46.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
46,SCHIFF," Well, I have a couple reactions. The first is, in that footage we saw so often of those photographs of those kids that were suffocating. You also had – I don`t know as a physician or a parent who was saying no one is doing anything about this. How can the world allow this to happen? No one is doing anything about this. That to me is the most powerful argument against standing still, doing nothing, and countenancing this by our inaction. That gentleman I thought made the most powerful and eloquent argument that something has to be done and we have this awful paralysis in the United Nations which is really the body that ought to authorize action against people who are gassing their own citizens. But with a Russian veto, with the Chinese veto or inaction, getting that done has been impossible. But what is the answer to that? Does the world just sit still and let people be gassed? I think, you know, that`s what the administration is confronting, this administration and the last administration. What concerns me about the last 24, 48 hours, is this attack, as awful as it was, it wasn`t the first. It`s one of several by the regime, and it does concern me that we not have an impulsive administration that is ready to completely change direction, that isn`t necessarily thinking through what are all the consequences here? What I would have argued before today is we use coercive diplomacy with Russia. They made this bargain. They brokered this bargain. Assad would get rid of his chemical weapons. He obviously didn`t. And use coercive pressure, build pressure to use force if Russia doesn`t get their client under control and put an end to this. And the marshaling of that coalition would have put a lot of pressure on Russia. Well, that`s all in the rearview mirror at this point. You know, it does, I think, send the message to other places like North Korea that this administration is not unwilling to use force, and, you know, that may have a salutary impact in other places. But I do worry that this president who now has this responsibility of office not act impulsively, that these things really need to be thought through. If we`re lucky, there won`t have been civilian casualties and if we`re luckier still, there won`t have been Russian casualties. But even these single strikes can have a danger of getting away from their original purpose.",1,2365.0,416.0,guest,47.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
47,MADDOW," Let alone trying to understand what the knock-on consequences will be in terms of way all the multivariate actors respond. One of the things you hope has been gamed out in advance. Congressman Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee – thank you for helping us understand this tonight. Appreciate it, sir. I will ask you, if we are going to hear from the president tonight, and we`re advised that we may hear from the president tonight, can we ask you back in terms of responding to what the president says?",1,537.0,95.0,host,48.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06

During this interview, this conversation, we`ve been receiving a few more facts starting with the exact number as the Pentagon sees it, 59 cruise missiles impacted this airfield. As military airfields go, not massive. Kind of a standard layout of two long military length, mind you, runways separated by the usual taxiways. Styles differ in construction between the U.S. and nations overseas. This is now – this airfield has received 59 impacts tonight from these incoming cruise missiles. Indeed, we`re told by the White House, the guidance is we will hear from President Trump tonight who has, of all thing, the leader of about 20 percent of the world`s people in Florida tonight, at Mar-a-Lago – President Xi of China. So, we`re told the statement will be a tape turnaround. He will make a statement to news media. We`ll all roll that at the same time. You`ll see it as we see it. For the moment, our chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel standing by in London. And, Richard, question that kind of melds politics with what we`re seeing in the military tonight. The world has watched the first 75 or so days of this presidency and this president. They have seen deeds and statements or the lack thereof. With that in mind, how will the world view this military action tonight?",1,1374.0,236.0,guest,51.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
51,"RICHARD ENGEL, NBC NEWS CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT"," I think it was just enough for president Trump to show that he`s different than President Obama. That he acted when his predecessor did not. But it is not going to get him into any real trouble. It was not a decisive action. It was more symbolic. It was a slap on the wrist, actually, and it`s the kind of thing you can do – it has a complete narrative. The U.S. military said earlier today that it has radar footage showing the aircraft taking off from this now presumably destroyed air base and flying about 70 miles – 67 miles is the distance to the town that was hit. I wouldn`t be surprised if at some stage we get to see that radar footage. And now, that air base has been obliterated and there`s ISR, there`s drones up in the air probably taking pictures of all of this. So, it creates a full narrative of a horrific event then how it unfolded and then the air base destroyed. But it doesn`t fundamentally change Assad`s capabilities. It doesn`t fundamentally change his grip on power. It doesn`t change the dynamic of the civil war in that country. It is a response that I think President Trump can go to the American people and say he did something and here`s the evidence.",1,1183.0,221.0,guest,52.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
52,WILLIAMS," So, Richard, this is – if you want to look at it brass tax terms, we just spent $30 million tonight. We endangered in launching these things, as you know, every time one of these clears the tube on a navy vessel, everyone breathes a sigh of relief. All the young sailors on these vessels that launch these things tonight. We killed some Syrians, I`m guessing. We may have killed some Russians, as kind of collateral damage. I`m guessing there`s fuel on fire. There`s cratered runways. There`s destroyed aircraft. Is that the extent of what we get?",1,548.0,98.0,guest,53.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
53,ENGEL," Well, I`m not saying that this was some political stunt. There was a horrific attack, and there was a response on that location. I`m saying that this was the minimum that could have been done in order to send that message.",1,223.0,42.0,guest,54.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
54,WILLIAMS, All right.,1,11.0,3.0,guest,55.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
55,ENGEL," The U.S. does have its hands tied in Syria to a degree because of the Russian presence. If the U.S., it turns out, killed some Russian advisers – and we`re being told that the Russians were given something of a heads-up, which would be standard according to Barry McCaffrey, who was on your air a short while ago, saying that in this kind of sensitive operation, another major power in the battlefield would be given a short amount of heads-up to try and deconflict the area but not enough for them to really change their operating status. But if the Russians had been killed, it would escalate dramatically. That`s a limitation. There are also hundreds of American troops in Syria right now on a counter-ISIS mission. If this had been a massive U.S. operation and many Syrian troops had been targeted and many Syrian troops had been killed, then it would be logical to assume that these Syrians might try to respond against those American troops, who would be sitting ducks in the country, within range of Syrian weapons. So, it`s not that he had a full range of options to deal with. All these options are bad. But what he did, it seems, he picked the least amount he could do that has a complete narrative. Hit the base where the attack was launched and leave it at that. And I wouldn`t be surprised if he leaves it at that and then gives a statement in a short while talking about decisive leadership and how the U.S. is now – is back in a leadership role.",1,1461.0,268.0,guest,56.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
56,MADDOW," NBC chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel joining us from London – Richard, thank you for being with us tonight. We do have a couple of quotes from this statement that we are expecting shortly from the president. Again, it is a recorded statement, and we`re told via the “Associated Press” that the president will say the strike on Syria was in the vital national security interest of the United States. We`re also told that he will call on civilized nations to join the U.S. in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria. Again, those are sort of advance quotes from what we`re expecting in terms of the statement from the president tonight. The president obviously is in south Florida at his golf resort, where he is hosting the president of the China for their summit. Joining us now is Michael McFaul, who is the former U.S. ambassador to Russia. Professor McFaul, thanks for being with us.",1,908.0,159.0,host,57.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
57,"MICHAEL MCFAUL, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA", Sure. Thanks for having me.,1,28.0,6.0,guest,58.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
58,MADDOW," Let me ask how you think Russia will respond to this. Russia obviously has been Assad`s greatest ally in Syria, not just in politics but in military matters as well. Lots of Russian military personnel. Lots of Russian weaponry. Lots of Russian missile defense systems on the ground in Syria. How are they going to respond to this?",1,331.0,59.0,host,59.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
59,MCFAUL," Well, as you`ve just been discussing, if there are Russian casualties, that will trigger, of course, a radical negative response. And I hope that there weren`t, and I hope that that was coordinated before this attack. So far, the Russian government stance has been that there wasn`t a chemical weapons attack and that they`ve denied that. And so, right now, their formal position, I think, will be to defend their ally, Mr. Assad, and defend the sovereignty of the state of Syria. Having said that, there`s a little “but” in my head, which is to say that in 2013, I was in the government. I was with the president when he met with president Putin. We did a deal with the Russians to eliminate chemical weapons in Syria, and at that time president Putin was the hero. Let`s remember that. He was the guy that convinced Assad to get rid of all these weapons, or so we thought. This doesn`t make him look like a hero, and so I can imagine a scenario where they do not overreact because after all, this has been a very limited attack. This is not an escalatory attack. This is not regime change just as all your previous guests have said. I could foresee a response that was much more muted than you might otherwise think, but because Putin himself was involved in getting rid of or at least trying to get rid of these chemical weapons in the first place.",1,1352.0,248.0,guest,60.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
60,MADDOW," There has been – on the issue of what this chemical weapons attack was on Tuesday, obviously there was an international effort where there was verified disposal of thousands of tons of Syrian chemical weapons. They had a huge weapons of mass destruction stockpile, and a lot of that stuff was gotten rid of. Since then, there have been a number of allegations of the use of chemical weapons, but ultimately what it boiled down to in most of those allegations is that something like chlorine or something like mustard was used, that there was a chemical element to a conventional attack but they weren`t, technically speaking weapons of mass destruction. We do not have confirmation that this was a sarin attack on Tuesday. The Turkish health ministry has said that it is. No other official body has made that sort of declaration. As far as we understand it, that`s still a matter of international investigation. Is there an argument to be made that before there was any official determination about the use of banned chemical weapons, that this may have been a premature response?",1,1081.0,186.0,host,61.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
61,MCFAUL," That`s a hard question because you`re absolutely right about the forensics of what was exactly used. For me, as somebody who was involved in those negotiations back in 2013, I`m wondering about the inspections regimes. What was – you know, what went wrong that this was allowed to happen? And most certainly it was a rapid response. Most – you know, I watched what the president said yesterday. It was clear to me that he wanted to do something, and he did something. You know, I have to say for me personally, I support the response. There`s just been too many people that were innocently killed in Syria for me, where we didn`t do enough. And at least to put Mr. Assad on notice that there will be a response, I think is a good thing. The thing I worry about, however, is what if he doubles down? He gets to respond to this by the way. It`s not like we get a vote and he doesn`t get a vote. And I worry about whether he challenges the United States, he challenges the international regime by escalating and perhaps using chemical weapons again. What will then be the response from the United States and the Western world? But today, I think it was the appropriate response for a horrible terrorist attack that President Assad did to innocent civilians in Syria.",1,1264.0,231.0,guest,62.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
62,MADDOW," Mr. Ambassador, let me just ask you one last point. On that matter that you just said in terms of Assad having a vote and it not just being our action and there`s no response, several Pentagon officials told Nancy Youssef, who`s a reporter who`s now at BuzzFeed, a very experienced reporter on national security matters.",1,321.0,57.0,host,63.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
63,MCFAUL, Yes.,1,5.0,2.0,guest,64.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
64,MADDOW," Several Pentagon officials told her this week that the chemical weapons – what appears to have been this chemical weapons attack on Tuesday by Assad may itself have been an action that Assad took to test the United States after Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, said on Thursday that it`s up to the Syrian people whether or not Assad is their leader, after the U.S. appeared to back off its previous insistence that Assad must go, that the attack on Tuesday itself may have been a test of the new administration, essentially to find out where the new lines are. From your experience in these matters, from the way that you`ve seen this unfold over the years, does that seem plausible to you?",1,697.0,125.0,host,65.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
65,MCFAUL," Well, I`ve heard that reporting and, I don`t want to doubt that reporting. It doesn`t seem plausible to me. I don`t think it would be that quick of a causal chain, right? They said that a few days ago, and then they decided to do this. I can tell you that the supporters of the Assad regime, including those in Moscow, did react to those statements from Trump administration officials. That seemed like it was a departure in policy, and as of yesterday, it was a radical departure from that departure, as you, yourself, was just talking about earlier in the program. And now this is a radical departure from previous, more deliberative responses before taking this action. And I think it makes everybody uncertain about where this goes forward.",1,745.0,131.0,guest,66.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06
66,MADDOW," Former Russia ambassador, Michael McFaul, now professor at Stanford University – Professor, thank you very much. It`s good to have you with us tonight. Appreciate it.",1,167.0,27.0,host,67.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06

69,WILLIAMS, So this is what`s happening in Florida. The president has spoken to television cameras. We`re told he spoke for about three minutes. Rachel read some of the little dribs and drabs we`ve been given from his remarks. We are – the tape has arrived back at a central location that feeds all the television networks. It is cued up and ready to go. We`re going to get a two-minute warning to when they roll that. We will then watch the president together.

70,MADDOW," The one piece of information we`ve gotten in terms of what damage may have been done by this strike, we`ve just had a report from a U.S. official to NBC News tonight, Courtney Kube at the Pentagon actually, saying that these Tomahawk missiles appear to have hit aircraft, at least one runway, and gas fuel pumps. There`s no word yet that there were human casualties or that there were human targets in this strike whatsoever. So far, they`re saying one runway, some number of aircraft, and gas pumps.",1,501.0,89.0,host,71.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-06

0,"RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC ANCHOR"," And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. “BuzzFeed News” reporter Ali Watkins has a sort of jaw-dropping scoop tonight about the Trump campaign. That story dropped tonight just in the last couple of hours. We`ve got Ali Watkins here tonight to talk about that story. We`ve got her exclusively. You are going to want to hear that. We`re also going to be joined tonight by Michael Leiter. Michael Leiter is the former director of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center. So, big show coming up tonight. A lot to get to this hour. One of the – one of the weirder stories in today`s news is the revelation that Jared Kushner, the president`s 36-year-old son-in-law is in Baghdad today. The U.S. secretary of state has not been to Baghdad since the new administration started, but Jared`s there. That said it`s not totally clear what the secretary of state does in this new administration. I mean, take the president`s special envoy for Middle East peace. That is a person who has been appointed to be the Trump administration`s eyes and ears that point person on Middle East peace, that person does not report to either the president or the secretary of state. That person reports to Jared. “The New York Times” and “The Financial Times” report in detail today that the preparations for the critical meeting this week with President Xi of China, those preparations are also being led by Jared. Jared has also been put in charge of relations with China more broadly, including preparing for this presidential meeting. He has been put in charge of us relations with Canada and U.S. relations with Mexico, including building the wall. He has been put in charge of all trade deals. “The Washington Post” reported last week that he is now in charge of, quote, “reimagining the Veterans Administration.” He`s also been put in charge of solving the opioid crisis and national broadband policy and criminal justice reform and the rebuilding of the nation`s infrastructure. Young Mr. Kushner also apparently sits in on National Security Council principals meetings when it comes time to discuss the nuclear threat from North Korea. And now today, Baghdad. Busy young men. Hopefully, he was adequately prepared for all these enormous responsibilities by his vast life and work experience, which consists entirely of him inheriting his father`s real estate business. He also did have to run the business himself for a time while his dad was in prison. But he now has this remarkable, remarkable portfolio, maybe an unprecedented portfolio of both international and domestic responsibilities within the administration. And that portfolio is made all the more remarkable by the fact that we now know that his wife, the president`s daughter, will also be getting a senior White House job. We don`t know exactly what her portfolio will be, but we know she`s already sitting in on many of the most high-profile visits by foreign leaders to the United States. Between her and her husband Jared, their experience and expertise in the world lies in the fields of real estate and jewelry marketing. But the two of them now will be in charge of some of the most important and sensitive stuff in the government of the richest and most powerful nation on earth. Incidentally, I should mention, we also learned a couple of days ago that the administration has now found a new job as well for Laura Trump. Who? Lara. Lara is Eric`s wife. The Trump reelection campaign already exists as a formal political entity. The firm that runs the digital side of that campaign will now employ Lara, Eric Trump`s wife. I have no idea what her work experience is, but I`m quite sure she`s the absolute best qualified person in America for that job, whatever that job is. I mean, in the past, we`ve had like you know a first lady who worked on a health policy. Once, we had a president who hired his brother as attorney general. But we have come to think of even those things as exceptions to the rule. We have never thought of ourselves as a country where like Uday and Qusay get to be ministers of whatever, right? We don`t think of ourselves as a ruling family kind of place. But now, now, that`s we are. And here is a root consequence of that for our new ruling family. This remarkable consolidation of power in the hands of a few under-qualified family members, today, that became not just a remarkable story about the Uzbekistanization of American politics. Today, that – and no offense meant to Uzbekistan, sorry – but beyond that becoming just a remarkable thing in its own, today, this new thing that we`ve got as a country, this consolidation of American government power in the nuclear family of the president, today, that potentially started to become a liability for the administration and for the government in terms of the most serious scandal that looms over the new administration. This is FCI Elkton. FIC stands for Federal Correctional Institution. It`s a low-security federal prison in Lisbon, Ohio. It`s prison for men. There are about 2,000 male prisoners there. This weekend, that particular prison, FBI Elkton, released a Russian spy. Technically, his release date was not supposed to be until the end of July, but they let him out on Friday with time off for good behavior. Now, that said, this Russian spy was not released back into the community at large. When he got sprung from federal prison on Friday, the federal prison system released him to immigration and customs authorities because as part of his plea deal when he got sentenced last year, he agreed that after he served his federal prison sentence, he would immediately agree that they would deport him back to Russia. This guy who was just sprung from prison is now being deported back to Russia. His name is Evgeny Buryakov. Evgeny Buryakov. When the FBI busted the spy ring that he was part of a couple years ago, in 2015, there were three alleged spies who were named in the criminal indictment. The indictment was brought by prosecutor Preet Bharara`s office in the southern district of New York, funny how his name keeps coming up. But Evgeny Buryakov was one of the three people named in this ring. He`s the one they caught. They arrested him January 2015 at a supermarket in Riverdale, New York. But the other two spies who were named in the indictment, they never caught them, because by the time they brought those charges, the other two guys in this spy ring had fled back to Russia already. One of them had been employed as a trade representative for the Russian Federation in the United States. The other one had been an attache at the Russian mission at the United Nations. But the – and they both went back to Moscow. They both escaped being arrested by the FBI. But this guy, the third guy who actually got caught, this guy who`s been in prison until this weekend, this guy who they actually nailed – he didn`t have an official government cover job like the other two did. They were all named in the indictment. The other two had cover jobs working for the Russian government. His cover job was a non-official cover. His cover job was that he worked at a bank. He was an employee of a Russian bank called VEB. He was the number two official at the New York office of VEB. And when he was arrested and charged with being a spy and put on trial, his ostensibly employers, this Russian bank, they paid for his legal defense. And that wasn`t all they paid for. On the day that he got arrested at that supermarket in Riverdale, his wife and his two kids reportedly fled their home and went to the rezidentura. They fled to the building that houses the Russian mission in New York. Associates of Evgeny Buryakov then reportedly ransacked the apartment the family had lived in. Evgeny is in FBI custody. The wife and kids have gone to the Russian mission. Associates of Buryakov tore the apartment apart, sliced up all the furniture, smashed up the wall board, broke the place apart. Apparently, they were looking for anything that Evgeny Buryakov might have left behind, or maybe any listening devices that the FBI might have hidden in his family apartment. Apparently, the FBI had put both cameras and microphones all over the family apartment. But by the time his associates were tearing the place apart looking for them, the FBI had reportedly taken them all back. And this is like amazing spy movie stuff, right, but think about the practicalities of it. What if you were the guy who rented that family that apartment? You can imagine how Evgeny Buryakov`s landlord felt about the state of that apartment when he found out that, OK, his tenant is going to prison, the rest of his tenant`s family has fled, and now, he`s got this huge literal mess on his hands, the furniture on the wall board and everything all smashed up and torn apart. Well, once again, the bank came to the rescue. In addition to financing Evgeny Buryakov`s legal defense, the bank reportedly settled with the landlord for about $45,000 to cover the cost of the damage done to that House when Evgeny`s friends tore the place part after he got arrested by the FBI and charged of being a spy. And Evgeny Buryakov and all the stories of how he handed off intel to the other Russian spies who were in this ring with him and the drama of his arrest and his family fleeing in the dead of night into the rezidentura, and the bugs that the FBI had placed all over his house, all of this stuff has been fascinating color for one of the more lurid Russian spy scandals in the past few years. But that bank and that spy scandal are turning out to be a very pesky asterisk that keeps getting affixed to lots of things about the new Trump administration, because that bank where Evgeny Buryakov was secretly working as a Russian spy, that – that is a state-run Russian bank. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev is on the supervisory board of that bank. The chairman of that bank started his career by going to KGB school, by going to the college that Russia operates for people who are going to join the successor agency to the KGB. That – that FSB trained chairman of the bank was handpicked to be chairman of that bank by Vladimir Putin himself last year. That bank, for a million reasons, should have a flashing red light when it comes to worries about Russian intelligence and Russian influence operations here in the United States, right? And after all, it was a matter of public record that that bank harbored and defended a high-level spy who was working there as cover and then paid for his defense and even paid for cleaning up his apartment after they torn apart looking for the FBI bugs. That`s why it was astonishing news a week ago today when “The New York Times” reported that Jared – Jared Kushner – had not disclosed a meeting that he took during the presidential transition with the chairman of that bank, with the Putin hand-picked FSB trained chairman of the spy bank, who apparently met in person with Jared Kushner in December. Jared Kushner never disclosed that meeting, despite all of the other troubles that have plagued this young administration about their undisclosed contact with Russian officials. For whatever reason, Jared Kushner did not disclose that meeting until it was reported in “The New York Times” a week ago today. And that alone is sort of problematic enough, right, when it comes to someone with the kind of portfolio, with a broad-ranging domestic and international portfolio that Jared has been assigned by his father-in-law in the new administration. Troubling enough, but now, BuzzFeed news adds their new scoop tonight. As I mentioned, this spy ring that got busted by the FBI, three Russian guys. One guy who had what they called non-official cover who ostensibly worked at this bank, the other two guys, their cover jobs were official Russian government positions. One of them worked as a trade representative for Russia, one of them worked at the Russian mission to the U.N. When it came time for these guys to feed their secrets and stolen documents and intel from their spy ring back to Moscow, what would happen is these two guys who had official cover, they would take care of that part of it. Not the guy – not the guy who worked at the bank because he ostensibly had their relationship with the Russian government. But the other guys who had official cover, the other guys who had Russian government jobs, they whenever they had anything to transmit home they would go to the rezidentura. They would go to the Russian equivalent of like a SCIP, a secure facility where they could make secret encrypted transmissions of information back to Moscow center, back to spy headquarters in Russia. And the way the FBI caught them and blew apart this spy ring with these three guys was absolutely genius. The FBI arranged to have somebody feed these guys supposedly sensitive stolen documents and they handed these documents over in binders. And these Russian guys, these spies, they took the binders with this juicy intel. They took the binders into the rezidentura, into the SCIP in New York, and the FBI had hidden microphones inside the binders. And so, they got to listen to everything these guys said, even when these guys thought they were in the most secure environment and couldn`t be surveilled no matter what. Inside the Russian mission, they thought they were essentially diplomatically on Russian soil. They`re certainly in a diplomatic immunity. They were in a Russian space. They thought they were in a secret environment, but the documents that they had sitting in front of them, the documents themselves were bugged. There were microphones in the binders. And so, the FBI got hours and hours and hours of tape off those microphones and the binders of these guys talking when they were quite sure nobody could hear them. And one of the things those guys talked about was the other guy in their spy ring who worked in the bank, that`s what they got him. Another thing these guys talked about were their repeated efforts to recruit Americans for their spying efforts and when this case broke open in 2015, and they released the indictment, a lot of the news coverage at the time was about the fact that these spies apparently wanted to target college girls in New York to be Russian assets, and that had kind of a nice tabloid appeal to it, even though the indictment didn`t indicate that they had too much real success with the college girls effort. Where they did have some success was with male number one. A quote from the indictment here, quote, “On or about April 8, 2013, the defendants discussed efforts to recruit a male working as a consultant in New York City as an intelligence source.” Now, what I`m going to quote you here is a conversation between the two Russian spies. The guys who got charged but never went to prison because they`d already fled back to Moscow by the time their compatriot got arrested at that supermarket. So, this is the two guys who are now back in Moscow who never got arrested, this was them speaking at the rezidentura, having no idea that they`re being surveilled. They`re speaking to each other in Russian and then this is – this is the FBI translation of what they said. The spy number one says, “Male one,” that`s the name they get the guy in the indictment, “Male one wrote that he`s sorry. He went to Moscow and forgot to check his inbox. But he wants to meet when he gets back. I think he is an idiot and forgot who I am. Plus, he writes to me in Russian to practice the language. He flies to Moscow more often than I do. He got hooked on Gazprom, thinking that if they have a project, he could be rise up. Maybe he can, and I do not know, but it`s obviously wants to earn lots of money.” Spy number two says, “Without a doubt.” The spy number one says, quote, “He said they have a new project right now, new energy boom. He said it`s about to take off. I do not say anything for now.” The other spy then says, “Yes, first, we`ll spend a couple of borrowed millions”, and then the first spy laughs, and then says this, quote, “It`s worth it I like that he takes on everything. For now, his enthusiasm works for me. I also promised him a lot, that I have connections in the trade representation, meaning you, that you could push contracts. I will feed him empty promises.” And then the other spy who is, in fact, working as a Russian trade representative swears, he says, “bleep, no, then he`ll write me, or not even me, maybe he`ll write to our clean one. Meaning, he will write to the trade representatives office and accidentally not talk to a spy. He might talk to a real drag rep. Wouldn`t that be terrible for their recruitment efforts for this guy?” The first by then says, basically, don`t worry about it. Quote, “I did not say the trade representation I did not even indicate that this is connected to a government agency this is intelligence method to cheat, how else to work with foreigners.” So, this is a conversation surveilled by the FBI through there you know magic microphone in the binders trick. That conversation happened in April 2013. They are talking about an American citizen. They`re talking about recruiting an American asset for their spying. That happens in April. April goes by, May goes by. In June, the FBI decides to act. June 13th that same year, the FBI went and paid that American guy a visit, quote, “On or about June 13th, 2013, agent 2 and I interviewed male one. Male one stated that he first met the first Russian spy defendant in January 2013 at an energy symposium in New York City. During this initial meeting, defendant gave him his business card and two email addresses. Over the following months, male one and the defendant exchanged emails about the energy business and met in person on occasion, with male one providing the defendant with male one`s outlook on the current and future of the energy industry. Male one also provided documents to the defendant about the energy business.” So, forget the college girls thing which didn`t really work out for them. This is what the Russian spies are after, right? This is –this is the start of how they cultivate Americans to betray the United States, right? Start off friendly. Start with a business relationship or maybe an academic relationship. Start off with, you know, could you just let us know your own thoughts on specific industries or specific things in the U.S. government. Maybe you could help us by showing us some documents from those industries. Let`s stay in touch. Let`s start a transactional relationship. Can I see what you`ve got please? Yes, I`d love to see those documents. What else do you have? I`d like to see more of that kind of document. I mean, this is – this is how they do it, right? And maybe it turns into something, maybe it doesn`t, but you cultivate assets. This is what they do. This is why they`re here instead of working at home in Moscow. Well, “BuzzFeed News” reports tonight that male one, and that spy ring indictment is the Trump campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page. He was recruited as an American asset by Russian spies in New York City in 2013. He was successfully recruited. He handed them documents and information to help them out and was enthusiastic about their relationship. That advisor, Carter Page, met with a Russian intelligence operative named Victor Podobnyy who was later charged by the U.S. government, alongside two others, for acting as unregistered agents of a foreign government. From Ali Watkins`s story at “BuzzFeed” tonight, quote, “A former campaign adviser for Donald Trump met with and passed documents to a Russian intelligence operative in New York City in 2013. The advisor Carter Page met with a Russian intelligence operative named Victor Podobnyy, who was later charged by the U.S. government alongside to others for acting as unregistered agents of a foreign government. Quote, “A court filing by the U.S. government contains a transcript of a recorded conversation in which Podobnyy speaks with one of the other men busted in the spy ring, Igor Sporyshev, about trying to recruit someone identified as male one. BuzzFeed News has confirmed that male one is Carter Page.” Here`s my favorite part, “BuzzFeed News has confirmed”. How did “BuzzFeed News” confirm that Carter Page is male one? According for Ali Watkins` story, quote, “Carter Page confirmed to BuzzFeed News on Monday that he is male one in the court filing and said he had been in contact with Podobnyy.” So, Jared`s in Baghdad, at the invitation of the Joint Chiefs, meeting with the troops, visiting U.S. embassy personnel. There is nothing too sensitive for Jared to be involved in, let alone to be running in this new administration. He is leading U.S. preparations for the China meeting. He was apparently at the table for the decision on launching the Yemen raid that killed a Navy SEAL, in addition to many civilians. He is in charge of all trade deals. At a very, very scary time in terms of North Korea`s nuclear capabilities and intentions, Jared is apparently at the National Security Council principals meeting when it comes to North Korea. But at some point in coming days, he will have to make time in his incredibly busy schedule to testify to the Senate Intelligence Committee about why during the presidential transition, he met with the FSB trained official who Vladimir Putin hand selected to lead a Russian state bank that is currently sanctioned by the U.S. government and that harbored a Russian spy network in this country, that among other things recruited a Trump foreign policy advisor as a Russian intelligence asset just a few years ago. Amid all the worry and focus and scandal and investigations about the Russian attack on our election last year and contact between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, amid all that furor, Jared Kushner took that meeting in December with the guy from the Russian bank and he never said a word about it, until a newspaper reported it. “BuzzFeed” reporter Ali Watkins, who`s the one who unmasks the Trump foreign policy advisor at the center of this Russian spy story, Ali Watkins joins us.",1,22147.0,3882.0,host,1.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-03

This must mean male one – why like we`re putting it together as we`re getting this news from you guys. And I just out of curiosity, I was like I wonder if that guy still in prison in Ohio?

18,WATKINS," Well, there`s a couple things that we know. Page was not in the government at that time, and there`s nothing to indicate that there was anything sensitive, and there would be really – it`s hard to imagine him having a lot of access to send some information at that time.

21,MADDOW," That`s not unusual though for this far as we understand, at least the way that prosecutors explained it at the time and the way the FBI explained at the time in terms of sort of Russian trade cap around these sort of things. When they cultivate assets, they start small, right? They don`t necessarily start with people even think they have access to sensitive information. They just start a relationship that results in their being the turnover of documents get that sort of that pump primed and then try to cultivate people for the long term.",1,544.0,97.0,host,22.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-03
22,WATKINS," Yes, absolutely. I mean if it`s something as little as kind of making that connection, it`s a long game.

27,MADDOW," Reason I want to be super clear about that is because we just heard then-candidate Donald Trump there naming him as one of his foreign policy advisors. In fact, naming is the second person he came up with on the initial list of foreign policy advisors. Isn`t this the sort of thing that should have kind of turned up in vetting?",1,329.0,62.0,host,28.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-03
28,WATKINS," I mean, that`s the question moving forward, right, is what did the Trump administration know and when did they know it essentially? Again, you know, really want to be clear here – this was three years before Page had any kind of connection to the campaign. Again, it doesn`t appear there was anything sensitive. But it is questions. I mean, clearly, this was a known fact in certain corners of the bureau, in certain corners in New York, and as I said, Page was very forthcoming with it. So, I think that is the question tomorrow is, what did the Trump administration know and when did they know it?",1,600.0,110.0,guest,29.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-03

36,MADDOW," Sitting in on the president`s meeting today with the Egyptian president was the deputy national security advisor K.T. McFarland. As the number two official on the National Security Council, it might make sense that K.T. McFarland was in on that meeting, except for the news that she is on her way out. Reportedly, K.T. McFarland is not going to be national deputy national security adviser for long. She`s off to be ambassador to Singapore. Ambassador to Singapore of all places – you know, ambassador to Singapore is a great gig if you can get it, unless, of course, your current gig that you have to give up to take it is being deputy national security adviser. I mean, no offense whatsoever to Singapore, but that`s like being promoted from being COO to being deputy undersecretary of pencil sharpening at the suburban satellite office. Quote, “A source granted anonymity to speak freely about the situation says Ms. McFarland preferred to stay on in some capacity and government in Washington, such as a possible role at State.” State as in the State Department in Foggy Bottom in Washington, D.C. Not State as in the lovely city-state of Singapore which is 10,000 miles away from D.C. It`s quite an exile. Regardless of whether that exile actually befalls K.T. McFarland, staffing from the National Security Council has been a real issue for this administration. Besides Michael Flynn being fired as national security advisor just 24 days – after just 24 days on the job and another deputy national security advisor position getting unfilled as soon as it got filled. There was also last week`s reporting that two National Security Council staffers were involved in the sharing of classified intelligence reports with the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes. They shared those reports reportedly on the White House grounds in the middle of the night for reasons that still haven`t been explained and that the White House is now only partially talked to but not really. One of those National Security Council staffers has been named as 30-year-old Ezra Cohen-Watnick. He was elevated to a very fancy job. He was elevated to be senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council, while Michael Flynn was still there. I have to tell you, we have now reviewed the resumes of what we believe to be the nine people who held that job prior to Ezra Cohen-Watnick getting it in this administration, we have found that none of the prior people who held that job had fewer than twelve years intelligence and military experience. Ezra Cohen-Watnick only graduated from college in 2008. He has vastly less experience than every person who has ever had that job before on the National Security Council. What was he doing there in that job, what`s he still doing there? When Mike Flynn was fired, H.R. McMaster came on as his replacement. H.R. McMaster as a National Security Adviser tried to fire Ezra Cohen-Watnick out of that intelligence job. But he was blocked in that effort by White House advisers Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster was told he had to keep this guy on. Why? Ezra Cohen-Watnick is being cited today by conservative news outlets as a source for allegations that former Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice asked for names of U.S. persons associated with the Trump campaign to be unmasked in U.S. intelligence reports. Now, there`s nothing illegal or improper or even unexpected about a national security advisor unmasking those names. There`s also no allegation that Susan Rice leaked those names if she did have them unmasked, nor is there any allegation that she made any of those intelligence documents public. But by making those allegations about Susan Rice, the National Security Council under Trump and H.R. McMaster itself appears to be operating at a political level now to try to shape a conservative-friendly alternative to the Trump-Russia scandal, one that stars the Obama administration as the villains instead of Vladimir Putin. However you feel about that story itself, what does this mean in national security terms? National Security Council is there for a reason. Is it weird that this is what the National Security Council is being used for right now? Is it dangerous? Hold that thought.",1,4292.0,715.0,host,37.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-03
37,MADDOW," Today, “The New York Times” reports that North Korea is trying to market the kind of lithium that would help you make a hydrogen bomb. Today, “The Financial Times” reports that the Chinese president`s meeting with our president later on this week is expected to be a very high stakes event and that while the Chinese government is bringing the full force of their diplomatic power to bear on that meeting, the person who`s heading up preparation for that meeting on behalf of the United States is the president`s 36-year-old son-in-law. Choose your adventure right now in terms of national security things you might want to worry about. But right now, there`s something strange going on with national security and how it`s handled in Washington. Right now, the National Security Council in the new administration, among other things, they`re caught right in the middle of what appears to be an effort to manage and politically shape the scandal around the Russian attack on our election last year and the Trump campaign`s potential contact with Russia. We all expected there would be a political effort to shape the response to that scandal or even to shape the way the intelligence about those matters is received, circulated and politicized. I`m not sure anybody thought that would be run out of a National Security Council though. How weird is that? How worrying is it in terms of the opportunity cost for the other kinds of stuff the National Security Council ought to be worried about right now? Joining us right now is Michael Leiter. He`s former director of the National Counterterrorism Center under President Bush and Obama in that role. He worked closely with the National Security Council staff. Michael, it`s nice to see you.

39,MADDOW," Let me ask you a big picture. When I have talked to other national security professionals, particularly people have had big jobs on national security like you have, they do not seem to be widely alarmed at the Trump administration`s national security capacity. There does seem to be faith in people like Defense Secretary Mattis and the National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster and others. Is that your overall view?",1,416.0,70.0,host,40.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-03
40,LEITER," Well, it`s certainly my view that there`s a great deal of confidence about some people in certain positions. As you said, Jim Mattis, H.R. McMaster, Mike Pompeo, I think people have confidence in as well. These are people who understand the issues, are mature, have worked within the national security establishment, and generally, people think they`ve got good solid judgment and will seek out expertise. I think the big question and the reason why I`m not as confident or sanguine as some others is that the struggles we see within the administration suggest those individuals, while important to their departments and agencies, aren`t actually central players at the White House in national security decision-making and aren`t shaping policy and aren`t helping the president set his priorities. So, it`s great if you have a strong team, but if you`re not talking to that team, if you`re not using that team`s expertise, then it really doesn`t matter who`s on the bench.",1,973.0,160.0,guest,41.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-03
41,MADDOW, The news that the General McMaster may have wanted to fire this young man who`s been named senior director for intelligence the national security council – I find it unusual that he`s in that job. I know nothing about him personally at all. I don`t mean to talk about him in personal terms. I`m just comparing his resume and his – the length of service and experience compared to other kinds of people who`ve had that job. It`s strange to me that he`s in that job. It`s very strange to me and worrying to me that General McMaster wanted to get rid of him and the White House told him he couldn`t. What is your take on that?,1,624.0,119.0,host,42.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-03
42,LEITER," Well, I think anytime if you`ve run a business, you`ve run a government organization, you`ve run a show. You want to be able to choose your team. And if the boss says, “I don`t have confidence in that individual”, and someone says, “I don`t care, he`s staying”, that`s worrisome. And it`s worrisome when, again, you point to H.R. McMaster being one of the adults in the room but he can`t choose his own team, it makes I think many of us question the degree of influence he has with the president. I think the individual – I don`t know him either. He`s certainly on the junior side of this. He hasn`t had the wealth of experience in multitude of agencies in the field 20-plus years of intelligence experience, and I fear that some of that youthful indiscretion, if I can use that phrase, may well have led him down a path with Chairman Nunes, which honestly just throws up smoke and keeps anyone from getting to the real issues that you identified, and it`s diverting us from the important national security issues that we face around the globe.",1,1045.0,189.0,guest,43.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-03
43,MADDOW," And the diversion factor there, the thing that`s most interesting to me is not sort of how diverted are we, and are we able to refocus on the important issues. The thing that actually worries me just as a person who`s interested in these matters and I`ve got no expertise in this field at all, but I`m worried that the National Security Council, somebody who`s operating as a senior director for intelligence with the National Security Council, is involved in political smoke-making, is involved in political diversions. I mean, I worry about that both in terms of the other stuff the National Security Council has to do. I also worry about it in terms of whether or not the National Security Council is a place from which political mischief could be made. Could they stick their – could they stick their hands into the middle of an ongoing investigation? Do they have access to kind of stuff where they could do real harm?",1,924.0,164.0,host,44.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-03
44,LEITER," Well, first I would say, there is some history the National Security Council putting its nose or its hands into place it shouldn`t be, and I don`t want to suggest that we`ve gone this far. But just think about Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North during Iran Contra, and the National Security Council being operational without the legal restrictions that the other agencies were working with in.",1,391.0,66.0,guest,45.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-03
45,MADDOW, Good point.,1,12.0,3.0,host,46.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-03
46,LEITER," And there is some risk when you had inexperienced staffers on the National Security Council who may not fully appreciate what they should and should not be doing, because it could implicate the investigations by the FBI. All that being said, the basic idea, the reason we ended up in this sort of Alice in Wonderland world was because it starts with a tweet from the president, saying I just saw something on TV, there is illegal unconstitutionally political motivated surveillance. That`s a big deal, Rachel.",1,510.0,87.0,guest,47.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-03
47,MADDOW, That`s a big allegation.,1,25.0,5.0,host,48.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-03
48,LEITER," That`s a big allegation. And in any other world, the president would have actually turned to his national security advisor and said, I just saw this, this seems sort of crazy. But get me the director of the FBI and CIA and DNI and National Security Agency, I want to figure out if there`s any truth to this. And it would start there, and it would be handed off to a staffer on the National Security Council to look at and investigate and they`d know what was going on. What we have here was a present tweeting. That tweeting then leading to his request to Congress to investigate the executive branch where he could have figured it out in a ten-minute meeting. And then, you`ve got the National Security Council feeding information back to Congress. It is beyond the hall of mirrors. It has simply confused the issue. And again, it is diverting us from those real issues. And I think equally important, it makes our allies worried. The fact is whether you`re talking about North Korea or China being more aggressive, all these issues are ones we have to focus on and our allies need our focus. And if we`re focused internally, they don`t believe that we have the time and attention to do that.",1,1194.0,217.0,guest,49.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-03

58,MADDOW," In Denver, Colorado, this weekend, people rallied to call in the state`s two senators to vote no on Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. Democratic Colorado Senator Michael Bennet says he won`t support the filibuster against Gorsuch and Republican Senator Cory Gardner, he`s a yes vote for Gorsuch all the way. So, we`ll see if either Michael Bennet or Cory Gardner pays a price for that stance on Gorsuch in Gorsuch`s home state of Colorado. But, you know, even without Michael Bennet, Democrats do have the votes to mount their filibuster against Neil Gorsuch, to stop him from being confirmed with the court unless he can get 60 votes. That showdown is going to happen later this week. It`s going to be a huge drama as the Republicans decide how they`re going to respond to that. Today, every Democrat on the Judiciary Committee voted against Neil Gorsuch`s nomination, but that was just a signal of the bigger fight that will come over this in the next few days. Here`s one thing to stick a flag in though in this in this news today and as you`re looking towards the rest of the week – while Democrats on the Judiciary Committee were taking this unified stand against Judge Gorsuch today, they did something else I got a lot less attention. In addition to advancing Judge Gorsuch`s nomination today, the Judiciary Committee also voted to advance the nomination of this man. His name is Rod Rosenstein. The White House has nominated him to be the number two official at the Justice Department under Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Now, who`s the number two at the Justice Department is particularly important in skin bowl terms right now because the Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from any investigations into the Trump campaign`s contacts with Russia. That means any Justice Department investigation of such things would be overseen by Rod Rosenstein if he`s confirmed, unless he chooses to a point and outside special prosecutor instead of overseeing things himself. That would be his call as well. During Rod Rosenstein confirmation hearings last month, Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut asked which of those avenues Rod Rosenstein would likely take. Would he oversee these investigations himself or appoint an outside prosecutor? Rosenstein refused to answer. Today, Senator Blumenthal became the only member of the Judiciary Committee to vote against Rod Rosenstein for this crucial job. Every Democrat except for Blumenthal voted to advance his nomination. The vote on Rosenstein was 19-1. So, stick a flag in this one. I mean, Democrats have to choose their battles obviously. They will win nothing if they can`t stick together. They are mostly choosing to fight on Gorsuch but not entirely. They are not choosing the fight on the number two job under Jeff Sessions who will run the Russian investigations. We may look back on this as a momentous strategic decision by the Democrats. Stick a flag in this one. Note this one for the record. That does it for us tonight. We will see you again tomorrow. Now, it`s time for “THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL”. Good evening, Lawrence.",1,3128.0,524.0,host,59.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-04-03

0,"RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST"," And thanks to you at home for joining us for the next hour. We are following the breaking news tonight that fired national security adviser, retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who was fired from the Trump administration after only 24 days on the job, tonight, he is asking for immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony in the Trump -Russia scandal. Now, General Flynn has reportedly approached the congressional committees in both the House and the Senate, as well as the FBI – more on that point in a moment. And he has reportedly offered that he will testify to all three of those bodies, both investigatory committees and the FBI, as long as he has given personal immunity from criminal prosecution himself. Now, it is not known at this hour how the FBI or the intelligence committees will respond to this offer and this request from General Flynn. But it was “The Wall Street Journal” who broke this story tonight. The lead author of their scoop is reporter Shane Harris. Shane Harris will join us live momentarily. Since “The Journal” published this scoop tonight, a lawyer for Mr. Flynn has released a slightly melodramatic statement explaining General Flynn`s offer in his own words or at least in his lawyers own words. Here`s how it starts. It says at the top, “Statement by Robert Kelner, counsel to Lieutenant General Mike Flynn.” And then the first line is this, “General Flynn certainly has a story to tell and he very much wants to tell it should the circumstances permit. Out of respect for the committees, we will not comment right now on the details of discussion between counsel for General Flynn and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees other than to confirm that those discussions have taken place. But it`s important to acknowledge the circumstances in which those discussions are occurring.” The statement then goes on to include a detailed summary of the general`s impressive long military career and the various awards he received for his military and intelligence work. And then that statement ends with this sort of, this call to arms. Quote, “Notwithstanding his life of public service, the media are awash with unfounded allegations outrageous claims of treason and vicious innuendo directed against him. He`s now the target of unsubstantiated public demands by members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated. No reasonable person who has the benefit of advice from counsel would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution again.” Again, this is the statement from General Mike Flynn`s lawyer tonight explaining with a dramatic flourish that he certainly, quoting, “certainly has a story to tell” but also defending why the general only wants to tell that story if he`s granted immunity from prosecution. Now that is worth knowing in terms of understanding how General Flynn is framing his offer. It`s worth knowing in terms of what our expectations should be for how the FBI and the congressional committees may look at that offer in terms of the way that it`s being couched. It`s also worth knowing, given Mike Flynn`s previous statements about what it means when somebody asks for immunity from prosecution.",1,3281.0,541.0,host,1.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
1,"GEN. MIKE FLYNN, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER"," I mean five people around her have had have been given immunity to include her former chief of staff. When you are given immunity, that means that you`ve probably committed a crime.",1,182.0,33.0,guest,2.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
2,MADDOW," Now that Mike Flynn himself is asking for immunity, we don`t know if that means he`s, you know, implicitly confessing to having committed crimes. But if he does come forward and freely speak about what he knows, I don`t know what that will lead us to in terms of the Trump Russia scandal overall, but him speaking freely, facing difficult questioning that would likely go some distance toward answering some of the big obvious unanswered questions that have surrounded him and his role in the Trump administration and in this scandal specifically from the beginning. I mean, literally, from the beginning of his appearance in this tale there were questions as to why he was brought on board at all at the Trump campaign in the first place. Mike Flynn did have a very distinguished military career, including long deployments overseas, but his time in Washington thereafter was the opposite of distinguished. In 2014, General Flynn was fired at the Defense Intelligence Agency after what was widely considered to be a disastrous tenure there. Before the Trump campaign officially brought him on board in 2015, there was his inexplicable but fairly widely publicized appearance in Moscow at a gala for Russian state-run television where he sat next to Vladimir Putin and he personally led the standing ovation for the Russian president. By the time Mike Flynn had come on board the Trump campaign, investigative reporters like Michael Isikoff were already at the Republican national convention here asking about that trip to Russia asking whether he`d been paid by the Russian government for making that appearance. It has since emerged incidentally that Mike Flynn was paid tens of thousands of dollars in addition to a free, all expensive paid trip to Moscow for himself and his son in exchange for showing up at that gala and sitting next to Putin. In addition to that money from the Russian government media – government-supported media outlet RT, in addition to that money, he also receives two other five figure payments from two other Russian companies after he was fired from the Defense Intelligence Agency. But nevertheless, the Trump campaign brought him on board. By Election Day, it was clear that General Flynn was on the payroll of another foreign government. He was on the payroll of the government of Turkey while he was advising the Trump campaign. Now, he was not registered as a foreign agent, but it was widely reported that he was, that he was he was taking money from a foreign government – from Turkey – to advance that country`s interests in the United States while he was simultaneously advising the Trump campaign. I mean one of the unexplained things, one of the things that the official announcement about him just makes no sense, right, one of the things that doesn`t make sense about Mike Flynn is how on earth he made it through the vetting process in the first place to become national security adviser, right, after the trip to Russia with those undisclosed payments by RT and by Russian firms, with the then undisclosed work as the agent of another government, he was taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from the government of Turkey and actively working to promote that government`s interest in the United States, while the administration was supposedly vetting him to be national security adviser? He`s an unregistered foreign agent, getting paid all that – I mean, they didn`t pick that up in the vetting? It wasn`t hard to vet that about him. It was like lots of news stories about it. I mean, that didn`t trip any wires from him? That has never made any sense. It`s never made any sense. Then he gets into the job, then he becomes national security advisor. As national security advisor, Mike Flynn, or the White House speaking on his behalf they repeatedly misstated the facts when it came to Flynn`s contacts with the Russian government. They had to repeatedly revise the number of calls and contacts they admitted that Mike Flynn had with the Russian government and the Russian ambassador. Flynn reportedly also downplayed the content of those communications, and the White House backed him up on that. It was only after the inauguration when the Acting Attorney General Sally Yates and another DOJ official came to the White House to tell the White House that Mike Flynn, national security advisor, wasn`t being honest about the content of his communications with the Russian government. He was in fact discussion U.S. sanctions on Russia even though he said publicly that he wasn`t. The Department of Justice came to the White House, those officials came to the White House and we are told that what they told the white House is a pretty lurid story. They came to the White House and told the white House that National Security Advisor Mike Flynn was compromised by a foreign power. He was vulnerable to blackmail and that`s obviously a serious, serious matter for somebody who had access to the kind of national security and intelligence information that he had access to as national security advisor. And after they received that blockbuster information from the Department of Justice, after they got that message at the White House, it still to this day remains unexplained that the White House having been advised to that fact, they nevertheless kept him on kept my plan on in his national security advisor job for almost another three weeks. When they did finally fire him their explanation was that they had to fire him because Mike Flynn had lied about those Russian government contacts to Vice President Mike Pence. That explanation is the official explanation from the White House that we`re supposed to believe about what happened with Mike Flynn. That explanation makes no sense and it never has. After the White House learned that Mike Flynn had lied to the vice president about the contact – content of his communications with the Russian government after the White House definitively learned that information, they waited almost three weeks before firing Mike Flynn. That delay is unexplained and, in fact, the vice president`s role in this saga at multiple points on the timeline just doesn`t seem plausible in terms of the White House explanation of events, right? It doesn`t make sense that when had to go because he lied to Pence, when once they learned that, they didn`t do anything about it for almost three weeks. That makes absolutely no sense. Also, Mike Pence had been the head of the Trump transition. As such, he would have been intimately involved with the selection and vetting process for a job as important as national security advisor. Nevertheless, Vice President Mike Pence has professed absolute ignorance of any of the scandals, any of the allegations of foreign payments and foreign contacts and all the rest of it surrounding Mike Flynn. Pence was the leader of the transition. As the leader of the transition, he was notified in writing by members of Congress about Flynn`s apparent financial ties to the government of Turkey. The transition was also apparently notified in person twice by Flynn`s own lawyers about his financial relationship with the government of Turkey. But nevertheless, Vice President Mike Pence says he had no idea about any of that, never heard about any of it, never – what? That shock – never heard any of it until weeks after he was fired. Until weeks after he was fired, Mike Flynn belatedly registered as a foreign agent, just a few weeks ago, admitting retroactively that yes he had been on a foreign government payroll while sitting in on the president`s daily brief and all the other high-end intelligence matters and national security matters he was privy to in the new administration. Vice President Mike Pence claims he had absolutely no idea of that despite him being notified about it on the record multiple times and it being a matter of considerable public discussion. Mike Pence`s role in the Mike Flynn scandal is flashing like a red beacon for anybody who sees him as the normal Republican in this set in this setting, right? There are two people about whom there are the most obvious unanswered questions and areas of concern when it comes to how the White House has explained itself throughout this whole debacle. One of them obviously is former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. The other one is Mike Flynn. And “The Wall Street Journal” reports tonight that he`s making an offer, if he can get immunity Mike Flynn says he is ready to tell his story. I believe it when I see it, but the man who reported this story tonight for “The Wall Street Journal”, along with his colleagues Carol Lee and Julian Barnes is Shane Harris. And Shane Harris joins us now tonight. Shane, thanks very much for being with us tonight congratulations on the scoop.",1,8773.0,1490.0,host,3.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30

4,MADDOW," So, you`re reporting is that Flynn has made this offer. He`s spoken to both the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee. And also, you report that he approached the FBI with the same offer that he would testify in exchange for immunity. Now, I`m putting a sort of a fine point on that because the statement from Flynn`s lawyer tonight mentions the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, but he doesn`t mention the FBI. Are you quite sure of that point that he went to the FBI with this same offer?",1,528.0,93.0,host,5.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
5,HARRIS," Yes, our sources have confirmed that to us and I trust these individuals in particular. It would not be surprising by the way for him to approach law enforcement with that offer as well. In fact, I mean we don`t know the exact sequence of it, but it wouldn`t surprise me if it was the FBI first, then you go to Congress. Getting immunity from Congress would actually be I think more difficult for him than getting it from the FBI, because there`s a whole lot of procedures at the Congress has to go through to give him that immunity. But clearly, as his lawyer said, he has a story to tell.",1,591.0,113.0,guest,6.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
6,MADDOW, Uh-huh.,1,8.0,2.0,host,7.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
7,HARRIS, And he feels that he needs protections in order to do that and it makes perfect sense as the lawyer said that he would seek those before he gives that testimony to investigators.,1,179.0,34.0,guest,8.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
8,MADDOW," And, Shane, what can you tell us about how offers like this are weighed. You mentioned there that it may be a very different calculus for the committees, the congressional committees, than it is for the FBI. But there obviously is an exact president precedent for something quite like this. But how would the FBI and how would those committees decide whether or not to take this offer?",1,386.0,69.0,host,9.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
9,HARRIS," In general, what investigators are weighing is how important is the information that that witness has to give us and it is – is it so valuable or do we need to get to it so quickly that we`re willing to give that grant of immunity? And there`s different kinds of immunity you can give. Limited immunity, which is kind of more narrowly focused around certain issues, that kind of limited immunity that was given to some of Hillary Clinton`s aides in exchange for information or access to a laptop computer in one case. But, generally, the basic weighing that you`re doing here is, is it worth it to get that information? And is there perhaps no other way we can get that information? So, if we`re seeing potentially not many takers for Mike Flynn`s offer, that could be an indication that these investigators feel that they can obtain this information from other means. They could, of course, also the congressional committees could subpoena him and he could take the Fifth, but they may have other avenues that they can get at without having to actually go ahead and take that, you know, pretty remarkable step of immunizing him from any future prosecution.",1,1158.0,204.0,guest,10.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
10,MADDOW," And, Shane, do we have any word tonight in terms of either the president himself or the White House more broadly, having any sort of response to this? I mean, part of the way I think we assess the seriousness or the likelihood of this coming to pass is whether or not the White House seemed shaken by the offer?",1,312.0,61.0,host,11.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
11,HARRIS," Yes, we haven`t heard anything from the White House on this at this moment earlier as we were going to press tonight. I would expect that, of course, Sean Spicer will be asked about this in the briefing tomorrow and that`s gonna be very telling because obviously if Mike Flynn says he has a story to tell, it is about his story working for Donald Trump presumably for those many months that he was an adviser and then his brief stint as the national security advisor. So we`ll find out I would suspect tomorrow if not before the briefing what the White House thinks of Mike Flynn`s offer.",1,589.0,109.0,guest,12.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30

It also just sort of feels like Thursday like days that end in “Y” have scoops like this in them these days. But there`s a lot to get to tonight and we`ve got a bunch of guests here. Stay with us",1,346.0,78.0,host,15.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
15,MADDOW," Senator John McCain has memorably described the Trump Russia scandal as a centipede where every day, we`re not just waiting for the other shoe to drop every day we just watch one by one as the other 99 shoes drop one after the other. The biggest one that dropped today is the news that former national security advisor, fired national security advisor Mike Flynn is offering to testify in exchange for immunity he`s obviously in a position to know a lot about the worst case scenarios within this scandal and so that is a very big deal, only something that big a deal could overshadow one of the other shoes that dropped today which was reported by “The New York Times” this afternoon, when “The New York Times” named to Trump administration officials who allegedly funneled classified information to Devin Nunes, head of the intelligence committee. The man you see here works in the White House counsel`s office. He was formerly a staffer on the House Intelligence Committee working for Devin Nunes. His name is Michael Ellis. The other figure named by “The New York Times” today is the controversial young intelligence chief at the National Security Council now. He`s controversial not because he`s famous but because after Mike Flynn was fired as national security advisor and H.R. McMaster ultimately took over that job, it was widely reported that McMaster was given free rein to staff up the National Security Council as he saw fit. He would not be micromanaged by the White House nor would he be stuck with Mike Flynn`s leftovers on the National Security Council. That promise apparently led General McMaster to believe he would be safe, he would be fine in firing Ezra Cohen-Watnick, who had come in with Mike Flynn and two reportedly was the source of strong objections from the intelligence agencies, particularly from the CIA. H.R. McMaster, newly hired his national security advisor, he tried to fire that kid, but according to “Politico”, this young Mike Flynn protege when he found out that the national security advisor wanted to fire him, he appealed directly to Jared, to the president`s son-in-law and to Steve Bannon, appealed to those two men and told him he should be allowed to hold on to his job and they agreed. And so, General McMaster was apparently brushed back and told he had to keep this guy, even though he didn`t want him. “The New York Times” now describes him and the guy from the White House counsel`s office, he used to work for Devin Nunes, that describing the two of them as having played a role in providing this mysterious information to Devin Nunes about Trump transition officials being caught and named in intelligence intercepts of foreign targets. So, “The New York Times” named those two. Then, tonight, “The Washington Post” added to it. They confirmed “The New York Times” reporting about those two names. They then also added a third name to the mix of White House officials that according to “The Washington Post” were involved in the handling of this data and getting it to Devin Nunes. They added to the list of names this man, John Eisenberg, who is the top lawyer at the National Security Council. So, out of all this news today, if you`re on one of those committees, if you`re part of the investigation of this scandal, it seems to me like there are two big questions for you that we had no idea needed to be asked before today. Number one, how are you going to handle Mike Flynn`s request for immunity in exchange for his testimony? I mean, literally part of that question is, you know, what`s the logistics of that? How does that work? How do you assess how good is information is when you`re deciding how much an immunity you`re gonna give him? How do you decide? What are the factors? Who makes the call? How do you question him and his lawyers about that? So, that`s one, dealing with Mike Flynn in this offer of immunity. Here`s the other new question we didn`t have before this morning, before tonight even, and this was raised by national security investigative reporter named Bart Gellman today who`s a genius as far as I`m concerned. We`ve posted a link to his analysis at MaddowBlog.com. You should read it for yourself. But it`s a – it`s a big – it`s a big conclusion here, it`s a big question. What were White House officials, if “The New York Times” and “The Washington Post” reporting is right that Devin Nunes got this stuff from White House officials, these three guys what were White House officials doing reading raw FBI intercepts of foreign surveillance that involved Trump transition officials and then asking for those names to be unmasked? How on earth would that have come up in there the normal course of their duties in the National Security Council or in the White House counsel`s office? I mean, think about that what were they doing monitoring who the FBI was listening in on, right? What`s the remedy here if what “The New York Times” reported and what “The Washington Post” reported is true? And what it means is that the White House appears to be tracking – the white House appears to be listening in on. The White House appears to be monitoring the FBI`s investigation of the White House. The White House is tracking that investigation by listening in on intelligence intercepts, obtaining those intercepts, obtaining those transcripts and then selectively leaking that information to try to pervert the course of the investigations? If the White House has its claws into the FBI investigation of Trump and Russia, if they have penetrated it are they`re tracking it in that way and taking parts of it and putting them out into the body politic to try to throw smokescreens out there, if that`s happening, how do you fix that? What`s the remedy there? A member of the House Intelligence Committee joins us next.",1,5800.0,1009.0,host,16.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
16,MADDOW," So, we`re continuing to follow what has been a sort of a wild ride of breaking news about the Russian attack on the U.S. election last year and the question of whether or not the Trump campaign colluded or cooperated in that attack. The Senate Intelligence Committee this morning held their first open hearing on that subject in which one of their experts dropped jaws around the room and around the country frankly when he testified that part of the reason Russian active measures were so effective in our election is because the Trump campaign and Donald Trump himself amplified Russian active measures and repeated them. Mr. Trump helped the Russians in what they were doing in terms of their public attack. Since that hearing this morning, there`s been multiple news stories that have broken in this in this field, including “The New York Times” and then later “The Washington Post” confirming that there are White House officials who can be named people whose job titles we understand who may have been involved in getting classified information into the hands of the House Intelligence Chairman Devin which he then gave a press conference about and ran back into the White House as if he needed to notify the White House of this information that came from the White House in the first place. We`ve got three named White House officials named by “The New York Times” and “The Washington Post” who may have been involved in that. And then tonight, “The Wall Street Journal” broke the story that former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn has offered to testify on this subject if he`s granted immunity from criminal prosecution. If you`re a member of one of these intelligence committees conducting these investigations right now, how do you deal with the news day like today? Not a rhetorical question. Jim Himes, congressman from Connecticut, member of the House Intelligence Committee, joins us now. Congressman Himes, thank you so much for being with us. Really appreciate it.",1,1986.0,335.0,host,17.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
17,MADDOW," So, a lot to deal with, a lot on your plate right now that wasn`t even there when you woke up this morning. What can you tell us about General Flynn reportedly offering to testify in exchange for immunity?",1,206.0,40.0,host,18.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
18,HIMES," Well, interestingly, when I last checked in, which was a couple of hours a actually nobody on the intelligence committee had actually received a communication from General Flynn. So, you know, we`ll need to wait to see if that comes in. And then, of course, what we`re what we`re going to need to think about is it is true that Congress or a congressional committee can offer immunity from prosecution. Obviously, when law enforcement does this they usually do this because the individual granted immunity has a story to tell which implicates higher-ups. You know, you arrest the corner drug dealer, you give that individual immunity so that you can go after the kingpin. Here, we`ll really have to think about and coordinate in particular with law enforcement and the reason I say law enforcement is because you don`t ask for immunity, of course, unless you feel like you`re in legal jeopardy. So, we have to be very careful here that the Congress or my committee doesn`t give immunity in such a way as to damage the ability of law enforcement, FBI, whoever it might be, that is putting Michael Flynn into legal jeopardy, that it doesn`t damage that case, whatever that might be.",1,1181.0,205.0,guest,19.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
19,MADDOW," In terms of your own experience, your own background and also your experience on this particular committee, when the committee is weighing this offer, if it doesn`t fact come through to the House Intelligence Committee, do you expect that as part of those negotiations, you`d have basically a more specific offer from Mike Flynn as to what he`s able to testify about, as to what the character is of this story that he says he`s so eager to tell? Would that be part of the negotiation?",1,485.0,87.0,host,20.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
20,HIMES," Well, of course, that`s the essential part of the negotiation, you know, around immunity. You really need to know what it is that the – in this case, Michael Flynn, but the witness might actually say and whether it`s valuable information. Look, you`re not going to grant somebody who potentially committed a crime immunity unless you really think you`re gonna get something of a very real value. And again, we need to be – this isn`t just one committee being asked for immunity. It is possible that law enforcement might be interested here and so, you know, my committee can`t just go off and say, “yes, no problem, General Flynn, we`ll give you immunity” without closely coordinating with whatever law enforcement agency my be in the back of Michael Flynn`s mind as possibly creating some legal jeopardy for him.",1,814.0,140.0,guest,21.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
21,MADDOW," Let me ask you congressman about this other news today from “The New York Times” and then added to by “The Washington Post” this evening, that there were White House officials, named White House officials who provided this mysterious classified information to your chairman, which he then held a couple of press conferences about and then ran that information back into the White House to notify them about this information, which apparently came from the White House in the first place? What do you make of that? Are you concerned that White House officials were involved and that they were they were tracking this information for some reason?",1,645.0,109.0,host,22.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
22,HIMES," You know, I keep thinking of that “Alice in Wonderland” line, curiouser and curiouser because nothing about this whole story is in any way shape or form by the book. I mean remember that the National Security Council, this is a group of people who advise the president on national security. They`re not the ones deep in the basement in some building outside of Washington looking at raw intelligence and intercepts. They`re the people who are really thinking strategically. So, it starts out being a little strange that there`s people scrutinizing raw intercepts and that sort of thing. And then, of course, you know these are these are not necessarily professionals. Some of the individuals named and I should I should be very clear up front that I don`t know if that story is true or not, but these individuals are recent arrivals at the National Security Council, and then the mystery of mysteries, of course, is who does the NSC work for? The NSC works for the president of the United States. So, why if this is all true individuals at the NSC would say, hey, instead of going to our boss with this information that we think is really important, maybe compromising, who knows, you know what we`re going to do, we`re going to call up one member the chairman of a congressional committee, of a totally separate branch of government and share it with him not with the president? And then, of course, we get into part one of the story, which we`ve been dealing with for a little while, which is that you know the chairman decides not to share this with his committee. So, again, none of this makes any sense. None of this is by the books and fortunately as you probably know, both the ranking member Adam Schiff and the chairman have been invited to the White House next week to actually look at this stuff and hopefully get – hopefully get to the bottom of it.",1,1862.0,335.0,guest,23.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30

27,MADDOW," Do keep an eye on this question about the National Security Council staffers and White House counsel staffers. If they really were reviewing raw FBI intercepts of foreign surveillance involving members of the Trump transition, why were they reading that stuff? And is it possible that the White House has been tracking the FBI probe into the Trump-Russia scandal? Using the intelligence community`s capacities, using the surveillance capacities of the U.S. government in order to track the investigation into themselves. If so, I really don`t know what the fixes for that. A lot still to come. Stay with us.",1,608.0,100.0,host,28.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
28,"JOHN DEAN, NIXON WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL"," To one who was in the White House and became somewhat familiar with its inner workings, the Watergate matter wasn`t an inevitable outgrowth of a climate of excessive concern over the political impact of demonstrators, excessive concern over leaks, an insatiable appetite for political intelligence, all coupled with a do-it-yourself White House staff regardless of the law.",1,374.0,58.0,guest,29.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
29,MADDOW," John Dean was the chief White House counsel during the Nixon Watergate scandal. The Senate Watergate Committee that was investigating that scandal, they granted him immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony in Watergate. But you know what? John Dean still ended up going to prison for his own role in that scandal. Immunity from prosecution – immunity from prosecution in a presidential scandal is complicated, and it has some mind-bending historical precedent, as we now face some of those same questions with Michael Flynn offering to testify in the Trump-Russia scandal in exchange for immunity himself. Joining us now is Michael Beschloss, NBC news presidential historian. Michael, it`s great to see you. Thank you for being here.",1,749.0,120.0,host,30.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30

32,BESCHLOSS," Well, he got an immunity to testify before the Senate Watergate committee, which meant that things he said in his testimony could be not be used against him in a trial. But the prosecutors did not give him immunity and the result was that went to prison for four months for obstruction of justice, he pled guilty.",1,314.0,58.0,guest,33.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
33,MADDOW," So, there`s that – and this was but we`re talking about this earlier with Shane Harris who broke this story at “The Wall Street Journal”, with Jim Himes, who`s on the investigative committee in the House that`s looking at this. There`s a difference between getting immunity from Congress and immunity from prosecutors. It can make all the difference in terms of whether or not you go to prison. They also have to weigh those competing imperatives when they`re deciding whether or not to grant it. In terms of history of things like this, how willing has the Justice Department – how willing have prosecutors been willing to go along on request for immunity.",1,658.0,114.0,host,34.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30
34,BESCHLOSS," Well, they`re oftentimes not very willing. Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor and Watergate was against doing it for John Dean. And then later on in the Iran-Contra scandal, Ronald Reagan, John Poindexter who had the same job that Mike Flynn did, national security advisor, got immunity for his testimony before Congress, but later on was prosecuted. He was convicted of a number of things, including lying to Congress. That was thrown out by an appeals court that said that somehow the trial used material that was from his testimony and therefore that undermined his verdict. So, you`re absolutely right. It is really complicated.",1,636.0,104.0,guest,35.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-30

36,BESCHLOSS," Signs of the cover-up in the White House, that`s what we saw very much in Watergate and finally, that`s what brought Richard Nixon down. But the big test of what we`re seeing with Mike Flynn is going to be the same test with John Dean and John Poindexter in the 1980s with Reagan, which was were they able to say things that implicated the president directly in the scandal? John Poindexter did not do that with Iran Contra. John Dean said in the first – and he was the first high official to do this, he said President Nixon has committed offences. He said, I hope that he will be excused and that that he`ll be forgiven for these, but that led directly to Nixon`s resignation. Dean`s testimony led to the revelation that Nixon had taped his secret conversations.

This particular scandal feels like an existential thing for this administration. It feels like if this stuff is proven they`re over.

50,MADDOW," You know, there`s basically like a menu of scandal to choose from. It`s not like a waffle house menu where it`s picture based and there`s not all that many choices and so you just point out the things that you want and how many of them you want on your plate. It`s not that kind of menu. The scandal menu right now is like one of those menus that`s a binder, with tons of pages, too many choices and you can`t narrow it down. I mean, just start – just start anywhere. Start anywhere. Start with Carl Icahn who has been tasked by the new administration with advising them on regulations. What Carl Icahn has been advising the new administration is that the administration should kill a regulation that will result in nearly a quarter billion dollar-a-year windfall for a company in which Carl Icahn has an eighty-two percent ownership stake. When the administration did an across-the-board regulation freeze right after the inauguration, mysteriously, the one new regulation they didn`t freeze was one that would positively affect Carl Icahn`s eighty-two percent stake in that same company for tax purposes. The Carl Icahn thing alone is a capital-S scandal. That just the Carl Icahn thing, that is as big a scandal as like say the one that made Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned in 1973. If you don`t like that one, may I interest you in the Scott Pruitt special today? He`s the former attorney general in Oklahoma. He`s now having his law license reviewed by the state of Oklahoma because he overtly, simply, clearly lied to the United States Senate under oath during his confirmation when he was questioned about whether or not he ever conducted government business on his personal email accounts. He did conduct government business in Oklahoma on his personal email accounts. He lied about that. He told the Senate that he did not. Yes, who cares about email? Well, who cares about lying to the Senate? And Scott Pruitt isn`t a humdrum who cares member of the Trump administration. Scott Pruitt may be the most radical cabinet secretary Trump has appointed to any agency. Today, Scott Pruitt took the almost unprecedented step of throwing out the window the EPA`s scientific findings that one particular pesticide is unsafe and should be banned in this country. Today, Scott Pruitt took that scientific finding, threw it out the window, said, screw it, don`t care, and on his own safe so, he decided that that pesticide will now be legal. Forget the process of determining whether or not it`s safe. Forget what the scientists concluded in his own agency, which is that it`s not safe. He threw that out the window said it`s legal on his own say so. So, it`s not like Scott Pruitt is an obscure or uncontroversial figure in the new administration. He`s doing his best to make himself as highly visible as possible by being a real radical when it comes to policy. But, you know, even if you like what Scott Pruitt is doing in terms of policy, he really did lie to the United States Senate. He might lose his law license for having done so. If anything like that had happened to a cabinet official in the Obama years, that would have been enough to keep the lights on at FOX News through like seven seasons of “Fox and Friends”. Even beyond Washington, there`s stuff going on right now that in any other time would be huge point to focus for the whole country. The governor of Alabama is probably going to be impeached next week. Arkansas is planning to execute eight men in 10 days. They`re planning on four double header executions, doubleheaders back-to-back, four of them, using drugs they`ve never used before. The U.S. military has now launched investigations into the second, apparently, terribly botched military operation of the young Trump era. The first one was the catastrophic raid in Yemen, which the new president apparently approved over a dinner with Jared. The second was a massive air strike in a civilian populated area of Mosul in Iraq, the U.S. and Iraqi forces had dropped leaflets reportedly in that neighborhood, telling civilians to definitely stay in their homes to not leave, and then U.S. planes came in and apparently bombed that exact same neighborhood. There are reports of as many as 200 men, women and children all civilians killed in their homes after the United States reportedly told them to stay in their homes and then bombed their homes. So take your pick from this scandal menu, right? That`s even setting aside any issues about self-dealing and conflicts of interest and the president appointing his children to high-ranking sensitive government positions and the question of whether the president is profiting from the presidency or even receiving payments from foreign governments through his businesses from which he is not yet divested – I mean even if you set that – set that stuff aside, the self-dealing stuff, we are already changed as a country, because before now, any one of these scandals that I just mentioned in Washington, around the country, would be nationally riveting, right, would be a source of seething outrage, if not bipartisan outrage then at least partisan outrage. But in this new American era, what we`re doing instead is kind of cataloging that stuff in the background, assuming we`ll get to it at some point. But in the meantime what we`ve been doing every day is watching the unfolding of the one Trump scandal that seems existential, the one Trump scandal vet it seems like might undo this presidency, by revealing this presidency as basically the product of a crime – at least the product of a foreign actor acting with American confederates. Every day, it is these ongoing revelations which keep getting worse and not better about the Russian government attacking the election, attacking the process by which we got this new president, and the prospect that it wasn`t just an attack. It was a collaborative or at least coordinated effort between that foreign government and our president`s campaign. The news today that we may get testimony in exchange for immunity from fired National Security Advisor Mike Flynn who is in a position potentially to know more about the scandal than anybody else, that news today revs this scandal up into higher gear that we didn`t even know we had in our national transmission, and you know, we will – we here at the show and I think on this network, we will cover this as aggressively as anybody. I think it`s been fair to say we have been as aggressive as anybody on this story already and that will remain the case. But I want to just plant this flag here – there remains the possibility that the president and his campaign are innocent. There remains the possibility that the president and his campaign are not incident – not innocent, but that this scandal does not prove to be an existential presidency-ending conflagration, even if they are found to have committed very bad acts. There remains the possibility that at the end of this, even if these investigations continue to go as badly as they have for the president thus far, there remains the possibility that the end of all of it, he`s still president and then for the sake of our democracy, we have to figure out how we are going to regain our in tolerance for corruption and scandal and throwing our American ethical and political norms out the window. One of the consequences already of the Russia attack and it`s aftermath is that what otherwise would be presidency ending scandals in any presidential administration are like, whoo page 15, if you get there, man. I mean, when all this is over and who knows how it ends, if we are ever to regain our previous standing as a liberal democracy, right, there`s going to have to be consequences for, you know, the Carl Icahn stuff for the lying to the Senate stuff, for the personal ethics stuff, for the nepotism. Even for the political radicalism that we now see is definitely no big deal because at least it`s not treason. Whether or not the Russia scandal brings down this presidency and it might, the point of the Russia attack was to knock America down a few pegs in the eyes of the world. They win and we lose if the outcome of all of this – regardless of this presidency – is that we become a country that lets all this other stuff slide, right, we`re even rank corruption becomes normal or too small potatoes for us to worry about it. We cannot let ourselves be the American generation where the standard slipped that badly, right, where that happened. At some point, we`re going to have to get back to zero in terms of being able to be shocked by corruption, nepotism and crime in government. We`re going to have to get back to zero when it`s all done. That does it for us tonight. We will see you again tomorrow. Now, it`s time for “THE LAST WORD”. Joy Reid sitting in for Lawrence tonight.

4,MADDOW," Thank you, Chris. Well done, my friend. Congratulations. And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. Boy, this has been a heck of a day in the news, right? We`re going to start with a mineral called bauxite. You mine bauxite. Basically, it looks like a combination of spumoni and dirt. But it`s a mineral and you grind up bauxite. You process it with lime and caustic soda and the super hot solution. And what happens when you do that to bauxite is that separates out from the bauxite something called alumina. And if you dry alumina out and take it to your metal processing plant, your smelters, you process that dry alumina powder into liquid aluminum. And the process by which you get that powdered alumina into liquid aluminum is the smelting process and in big aluminum smelters it`s one of the things, we humans have created to most closely approximate the pits of hell on earth. Right? The pictures from aluminum smelters, especially big, big aluminum smelters, it`s basically sci-fi, right? It`s hard to believe that this is on the surface of the planet. When the Soviet Union collapsed and its state-owned giant aluminum smelters were becoming private property, private businesses, that heavy Russian industry, like a lot of other Russian industries at the time, turned into full scale murderous gang warfare. As various thugs and connected gangsters fought it out, in many cases literally, for control of what they knew would be a multibillion dollar private industry, the Soviet, the former Soviet now Russian aluminum industry. In Siberia at the time in the 1990s, one of the contenders in that fight, one of the guys who is trying to get control of this mammoth Russian industry, famously, he started sleeping at his smelters. He would sleep at these hell mouths, right, so he could be there 24 hours a day. He could – he would sleep in the middle of those pits, so that he would be there to be able to stop sabotage in his smelters. So, he`d be the first one to arms if the wolves he was competing against in that industry came to his door, came to his smelter, came to his factories to try to take off from him what he was trying to build. It was a very brutal start sleeping in the smelters. But you know what? He won. By the following decade, he was the aluminum king of Russia. He cornered the market. He was a multibillionaire. The U.S. State Department was describing him in cables as, quote, “enjoying a favorable relationship with President Putin.” He was a more or less permanent fixture on Putin`s trips abroad and he`s widely acknowledged by our contacts to be among the two or three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis. That`s from a State Department cable in 2006. 2006 is also when the same Russian billionaire, the aluminum king, the buy who was basically Putin`s right hand man, never left his side, took all his trips abroad with him, 2006, the year that State Department cable is also the year that that same billionaire started paying Donald Trump`s presidential campaign chairman $10 million a year. It`s a contract that reportedly started paying Paul Manafort $10 million a year starting in 2006. We don`t know how long those payments continued. We don`t know when they ended or if they ended, but “The Associated Press” broke this story this morning based on documents obtained from Manafort`s businesses and records of international wire transfers that the “A.P.” reviewed. And if it feels like everything went nuts today in the news, this story may very well be why. According to “The Associated Press”, Manafort proposed in 2005 and started getting paid in 2006 in a contract arrangement with this Russian zillionaire where he agreed, quote, “to influence politics, business dealings and news coverage in the United States to benefit the Putin government.” For that contract, he signed a deal that would pay him $10 million annually beginning in 2006. According to a memo written by Paul Manafort proposing this arrangement to the Russian billionaire, quote, “We are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success.” Paul Manafort in this document then explained that where he would exert his influence on behalf of the Putin government was at, quote, “The highest levels of the U.S. government, at the White House, at Capitol Hill, at the State Department.” Again, “The Associated Press” obtained these documents today from Manafort`s consulting business. They say they saw records of wire transfers of millions and millions and tens of millions of dollars to Paul Manafort, $10 million a year starting in 2006, ending we don`t know when. I should note that it`s also a matter of public record that when Paul Manafort was hired to run the Trump campaign last year, he worked for free. It`s kind of a sweet gesture when you think about it. Trying to follow the news today was like if you wanted to read a book, you intended to read a book, but instead what you were offered by the universe was a shower of thousands of pieces of shredded book. Like, which would make for an excellent ticker tape parade but it was made it hard to follow the narrative. Today was just a blizzard of news and it seems like the news got more and more serious as the day went by. And not just because of deliberate distraction. I mean, there are a lot of substantive things going on. The terror attack in London today, it was a very big deal. One police officer and three civilians dead in addition to the attacker himself. We`re going to have more on that attack coming up, including the latest from the Metropolitan Police. Today in Washington, there was another day of Supreme Court confirmation hearings for nominee Neil Gorsuch. The substance of these hearings is increasingly getting overshadowed, at least on one side of the aisle, but what are basically now louder and louder calls for the Democrats to stop participating in these hearings, to try to just stop the process instead if for no other reason than that fact that this president`s campaign is the subject of a counterintelligence investigation by the FBI to see if they colluded with a foreign power in an attack on the United States last year. Maybe in the immediate aftermath of the FBI confirming that investigation, maybe that`s not the time to be acting on a far-reaching and irreversible action by that president. And to that point, tomorrow, Congress is set to vote on the president`s Obamacare repeal which will throw 24 million Americans off their health insurance if they get it through. It`s all happening at the same time. It`s all happening right now. And into that confetti maelstrom today, we also got the political equivalent of a flash bang grenade, to mix my metaphors, right? We got this huge showy confusing break in the news this afternoon when the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a man who is supposed to be leading one of the two bipartisan congressional investigations into the Russian attack last year and the possible Trump campaign collusion with that attack, today that congressman, Devin Nunes, held not one but two fairly breathless press conferences alleging something. He couldn`t quite say what, about the intelligence community and the Trump transition of which he was an executive member, things he had seen but he could not describe that made him feel alarm, that made him feel concern, that ought to make us all feel alarm and concern, and they certainly would make us feel concerned if we knew what they were but he would not tell us, in fact, he did not have these things in his possession, and he had not shown them to the rest of the committee who were participating in this investigation he`s supposedly leading. And we`re going to have more on what he did today in just a moment with a reporter who really understands these matters than almost anybody else in American journalism. But for the moment suffice to say the only new information, the only advance in our understanding that came out of what Congressman Devin Nunes did today, the only granular thing he gave us, that means anything other than the big distraction this all cost today, the only thing knew to come out of what he did today is new uncertainty as to whether or not there really is going continue to be an investigation in the House of Representatives under his leadership, about what happened to our country last year and what the Trump campaign`s role was it in it if any. The only concrete outcome of what House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes did today was raise the question of whether or not he just blew up his own investigation. And, you know, maybe that`s not the most important thing in the world, right? In the Senate, they`re also doing an intelligence committee investigation. And we know the FBI is doing their own counterintelligence investigation and how you feel about the competence and the independence of that FBI investigation will depend on where your personal James Comey tea leaves are today, you know? Whether you think he is trustworthy or not, whether you think he is running a trustworthy FBI or not, whether you think the Justice Department under Jeff Sessions is going to allow for an untrammeled FBI investigation to go wherever the facts lead it up to and including potential criminal prosecutions if necessary. But regardless of how many investigations there are, regardless of who does the investigation, today, there is new reason to be convinced that a real investigation is necessary. That this is – this stuff is a big deal and part of that is this absolute bombshell dropped by the “Associated Press” today about the Trump campaign chairman reportedly being paid tens of millions of dollars annually to covertly advance the interest of Putin`s government inside the United States in an effort that started ten years ago and we don`t know when it ended or if it ended. That`s part of it. Another part is what we learned from the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, what we learned from him on the central question, the existential question, the question that will end the Trump presidency on if it turns on to be true, on the central question of whether or not the Trump campaign helped Russia. Whether they knew about and cooperated with Russia`s attack while Russia was attacking the United States. Congressman Adam Schiff, top Democrat on the Intel Committee, on Sunday morning, he claimed on “Meet the Press” that there is in fact evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians last year, but he said that evidence was circumstantial. He said that on “Meet the Press,” on Sunday morning. There`s circumstantial evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. This evening on the daily version of “Meet the Press” with Chuck Todd, in the middle of Chuck trying to sort out all this mishegoss what happened with this Devin Nunes today and whether chairman Nunes was saying anything substantive or whether there was just a distraction and whether there were any verifiable claims there and whether there is still going to be an intelligence committee investigation after Nunes did that today – in the middle of sorting that out today on his 5:00 show this afternoon, Congressman Adam Schiff joined Chuck Todd for part of that discussion at the end of the hour and listen to what he said tonight.",1,11422.0,1972.0,host,5.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
5,"CHUCK TODD, MEET THE PRESS"," But you admit, it`s a circum – all you have right now is a circumstantial case?",1,80.0,17.0,guest,6.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22

7,SCHIFF," I don`t want to go into specifics, but I will say that there is evidence that is not circumstantial and is very much worthy of investigation. So, that is what we ought to do.",1,175.0,35.0,guest,8.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
8,MADDOW," That is a serious and specific new allegation. Like just – I know there`s a lot of noise around this subject today and around lots of subjects today. But just be clear on this one point. Just to be very clear, on Sunday morning, Congressman Adam Schiff, top Democrat on the Intel Committee, said there was circumstantial evidence of the Trump campaign colluding with the Russians last year during their attack. The following day, on Monday morning, that`s when the FBI confirmed there is an ongoing counterintelligence investigation into whether or not the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. That night, Monday night, I asked Congressman Schiff on this show if he could elaborate a little bit. Tell me what he meant on “Meet the Press” when he said there was circumstantial evidence. Tell me what he meant by the phrase “circumstantial evidence” when he said that`s what we`ve got on the issue of collusion. And when I asked him about that Monday night, here`s how he answered that.",1,985.0,169.0,host,9.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
9,MADDOW," Congressman, on NBC yesterday, you said that you see there being an accumulation of what you described as circumstantial evidence that there was collusion between this Russian operation and associates of Donald Trump during the campaign. Can you just expand on that a little bit, what you meant by circumstantial evidence and both the limits of that, but also the extent of it?",1,378.0,64.0,host,10.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
10,SCHIFF," Well, I know when you use that term, a lot of people think that circumstantial evidence isn`t very telling, it isn`t very powerful, but it all depends on what kind of circumstantial evidence. I can`t go into a lot of specifics here, but probably the best example for your viewers is if you go outside in the afternoon and there`s no snow on the ground and you wake up the next morning and there is snow on the ground, you can pretty conclude that it snowed overnight. That`s circumstantial. If you see the snow coming down then you can say, I have direct evidence that it snowed. So, circumstantial evidence can be very, very powerful and indicative of something that`s happened.",1,680.0,122.0,guest,11.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
11,MADDOW," So, that`s as much as he was willing to say on Monday night. Congressman Schiff, again, he has access to everything the intelligence committee is seeing and on Monday morning, he said there`s circumstantial evidence of collusion, Monday night, he`s giving more descriptive elaboration about what he means that by their being circumstantial evidence of collusion. Now, tonight, he has moved on from that. He is now saying something new. He`s now saying it`s not just circumstantial evidence anymore. It`s more than that. Again, just play that piece of that real quick. Do we have that?",1,585.0,97.0,host,12.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
12,SCHIFF," I can`t go into the particulars but there is more than circumstantial evidence now. So, again, I think Director Clapper –",1,122.0,22.0,guest,13.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
13,TODD, You have seen direct evidence of collusion?,1,44.0,8.0,guest,14.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
14,SCHIFF," I don`t want to go into specifics, but I will say that there is evidence that is not circumstantial.",1,101.0,20.0,guest,15.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
15,MADDOW," That`s new. We reached out to Congressman Schiff`s office tonight to find out what this means, to make sure that the congressman did not misspeak, that he`s intending to move the ball forward like this with what he is asserting, his office told us that the congressman meant what he said, he did not misspeak. His office also told us that the congressman not only intended to say what he intended to say but that he wouldn`t give us further elaboration on it tonight. We asked further if this new evidence that he`s seen, this non-circumstantial evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia, we asked if that had anything to do with what Chairman Devin Nunes was talking about today. His office told us, no, has nothing to do with that at all, it`s a separate matter. So, whatever Congressman Schiff is describing here has nothing to do with this sideshow from Devin Nunes today on Capitol Hill and at the White House. So, whether or not the Intelligence Committees continue their investigations, the top Democrat who is part of that investigation in the House says there is something new and big that has just arisen since Monday that is evidence of collusion between Trump and the Russians during the Russian attack. That`s a big deal. And so, whoever is going to carry on with this investigation, it seems more important than ever that this investigation carry on. And there`s just one last point here, in terms of the importance of there being at least one credible real investigation of what has happened here and the Trump campaign`s involvement with it, if there was any. Yesterday in Moscow, this man either fell or was thrown out of a fourth of floor window in a Moscow apartment building. Miraculously, he survived. He has serious head injuries. He`s in intensive care in a hospital in Moscow. That was yesterday. Today, he was due to testify in a case about Russian money laundering. He`s also due to testify in May in New York in a Russian money laundering case brought in federal court by Preet Bharara`s office. Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney who was controversially fired by the Trump administration two weeks ago even though he had previously been asked to stay on. Both of those cases, both the New York federal court case and the case in Russia, both of those cases in which this man was due to testify are about a very famous quarter billion dollar fraud scheme in Russia. It involved a Western capital management firm that was operating in Moscow and basically what happened is they got squeezed by Russian authorities and ultimately, it was a tax fraud scheme that resulted in Russian government officials apparently using this Western company to rip off $230 million from Russian taxpayers. And the firm was aware of what was going on while Russian officials were doing this at their expense and the firm tried to blow the whistle when that happened and the auditor for that firm was a guy called Sergei Magnitsky. And the Russian authorities and the Putin government they grabbed him and threw him in prison and you can hold somebody in Russia for a year in prison before you bring charges against them. They held him in prison for almost a year and then one week before that year was due to be up, he mysteriously died in prison. He was 37 years old. His name was Sergei Magnitsky. After he was dead, Russian officials blamed the whole fraud scheme on him posthumously. There was a Magnitsky Act in U.S. law that prohibits all sorts of Russian officials who were implicated in that guy`s death and implicated in that fraud, there`s a U.S. law that prohibits Russians who were implicated in that scandal from coming into the United States. It`s essentially targeted sanctions on people who are involved in that fraud and what appears to have been that murder. We reported last month on this show on a Russian activist, a former journalist who had lobbied in this country to expand the Magnitsky Act, to expand it beyond just people involved in that one crime. It would be expanded to impose sanctions and penalties on all sorts of different Russian officials who were involved in wide scale corruption and crime and murder. And we reported on that Russian activist last month here on this show, because for the second time in two years, he narrowly survived being poisoned. His name is Vladimir Kara-Murza. He`s now out of a coma. He may yet survive the second attempt to kill him with poison. Sergei Magnitsky`s lawyer is in intensive care today with sever head injuries. He may yet survive whatever it was that saw him fling off a fourth floor window ledge yesterday in Moscow head first. He may yet survive but he certainly wasn`t able to testify today. Sergei Magnitsky, though, he did not survive. He was dead at 37. They raided that Western company where he was working in 2007. They threw him in prison in 2008. They killed him in prison in 2009. And in 2006, 2007, 2008 and at least through 2009, Paul Manafort, Donald Trump`s campaign chairman, that`s when he was being paid $10 million a year to promote the interests of Vladimir Putin`s government secretly in the United States without registering as a foreign agent, without declaring who he was working for, and without ever before now having to defend publicly his real intentions and his real paymasters while he was doing what otherwise appeared to be American political work. There`s a lot going on. Some of it is deadly, deadly, deadly serious. We have got Charlie Savage here tonight, one of the best national security and justice correspondents in the country. We have one of the “A.P.” reporters here tonight who broke this story on Paul Manafort`s contract to promote Putin`s government secretly in this country. We`ve got the latest on what happened today in London. Lots ahead tonight. Stay with us.",1,5801.0,1011.0,host,16.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
16,MADDOW," So, this afternoon, Congressman Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he rushed to the microphones to tell the press about what he called “significant developments” in his committee`s investigation of Russian interference in the U.S. election. What he told the assembled reporters on Capitol Hill was that the American intelligence community, while engaged in surveillance of foreign targets, they had incidentally collected information about American citizens who were involved in the Trump transition. Hmm. He said details about these people in the Trump transition were, quote, “widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting”, to which the inevitable response is, ooh, what do you mean? Also, is this bad? Are you saying something illegal has happened? Are you saying that U.S. intelligence agencies have improperly surveilled someone? What do you mean? Reporters started by asking the very juicy obvious low-hanging fruit question which is, “Are you saying, Mr. Chairman, that U.S. intelligence agencies surveilled the president-elect? They looked at his communications and then shared those around? You mean they listened in on Trump?” Simple question – you`d think. Here`s the first time he got asked.",1,1268.0,190.0,host,17.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22

24,MADDOW," Until Friday. That`s strange, because we all thought he had the information and that`s why he convened this press conference, to talk about the information that he had. But on that one direct question, the president had his communications intercepted here? The answers were yes, it includes the president, no, it doesn`t include the president and then, “it`s possible it includes the president”, and then, “we`ll know on Friday.” And then literally 10 seconds later, he was back to the first answer again.",1,506.0,84.0,host,25.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
25,REPORTER," Mr. Chairman, was the president`s conversations or anything about the president appearing in intelligence reports? Is that what you`re saying?",1,143.0,21.0,guest,26.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
26,NUNES, I have seen – I have seen intelligence reports that clearly show that the president-elect and his team were – I guess at least monitored and disseminated out in intelligence.,1,175.0,31.0,guest,27.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
27,MADDOW," So, yes and then no, and then, it`s possible, I don`t know, I`ll let you know on Friday and then back to yes, yes, I have seen reports that clearly show the president elect was monitored. I guess, at least, all in a space of two minutes. And then it was off to the White House to go brief the president on these definitive new findings. At a second press conference after his meeting with the president, Congressman Nunes was asked why it was appropriate for him to brief the White House given that his committee is supposed to be investigating the president`s campaign right now. Mr. Nunes said it was appropriate to do that because these findings that he was discussing today have, in his words, quote, “nothing to do with the Russia investigation.” A reporter then asked, well, if he`s going to open a new investigation into this stuff since he said this material isn`t related to existing investigation, would he open a new investigation on this stuff? His reply to that was that this stuff is part of the existing investigation, you guys. Quote, “We`re already investigating.” So, it`s OK for me to take this to the White House because this isn`t part of our investigation and, of course, we`re investigating this because it`s part of our investigation. What are you talking about? Congressman Nunes finished off his afternoon with an interview on CNN in which he was still unable to give any coherent answer about whether or not Donald Trump`s communications were picked up in this surveillance he is allegedly describing from the time when he was president-elect. But after all that, after two press conferences and a briefing for the president and a TV interview, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, I have to tell you, still has not shared any of this new information that he says he has with his own committee where he is supposedly leading a robust investigation. He still hasn`t actually shown the information to anyone, including the other people he`s supposed to be investigating with. Top Democrat on that committee gave his own press conference tonight in which he said that the chairman`s actions may have made it impossible for the committee to do its work with any credibility from here on out. This was a big weird distracting story in the news today but the bottom line news here, I mean, really the takeaway here is that Congressman Devin Nunes is behaving very strangely for a man who is supposed to be leading a bipartisan of a very serious national security matter. That`s – that`s really the bottom line. That was weird. You`re running this investigation and that`s how you`re behaving? Don`t – headlines aside, he did not release any information today. He has not shown any information to anyone else. He is not even claiming that he actually is in possession of any information. He is not claiming that any laws were broken. And while saying that he is alarmed and concerned and everybody should be alarmed and concerned and the president should be alarmed and concerned, he`s not actually making any sort of coherent case as to what anybody should be concerned about.",1,3111.0,539.0,host,28.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22

32,MADDOW," So, can I ask you to just sort me through? Explain a little bit of how this wiretapping stuff works. We heard a lot of people talking today about the idea of routine surveillance of foreign targets. What does that mean, routine surveillance?",1,242.0,44.0,host,33.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
33,SAVAGE," So, the FBI here at home and the NSA abroad are engaged in foreign intelligence collection using surveillance all the time, everyday, especially abroad. The NSA is targeting foreign government leaders, businessmen who were involved in major deals that have geopolitical implications, terrorism suspects, all kinds – you know, the definition of what counts as foreign intelligence is extraordinarily broad. It`s almost anything. And so, if they are specifically targeting a person they think might have that intelligence because they`re a prominent person in whatever world they`re looking at or if they`re vacuuming up stuff abroad in hopes of gathering that stuff, they are going to inevitably suck in conversations in which at the other end of the line or receiving and sending e-mails to and from that target is an American. And the rules allow the government to use that collected information even though it involves an American if it involves foreign intelligence. Something they think is relevant. They can even identify the American in their reports to each other if the identity of the American is necessary to understand that foreign intelligence. This incidental collection and the rules surrounding what the government can do with it has been a major dispute about surveillance in the post-9/11 world. It surrounds the Bush administration`s warrantless wiretapping program and what the FISA Amendments Act that grew out of it. It`s been a huge conversation in the courts and in Congress for years, but it`s been an issue that has been like the hippy issue, right? The civil libertarians, the ACLUs and the Rand Pauls like, hey, wait a minute, what about the rules? Is this going to intrude on Americans` privacy? And the sort of standard conservative line has been, eh, whatever, this is about getting terrorists. And it`s one of the most interesting developments of all of this chaotic mess that you`ve been trying to explain tonight has been the sudden awakening that incidental collection and the rules surrounding what can happen to it when the government finds itself in possession of private information about Americans without having set out to get that information but came anyway because they were talking to targets is suddenly of great salience to an entirely different set of the political factions. And it`s happening in a year in which the FISA Amendment Acts, the warrantless surveillance program, is up for renewal and it`s going to be fascinating to see how this plays out.",1,2502.0,410.0,guest,34.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
34,MADDOW," Charlie, one of the ways, one of the reasons we`ve sort of been anticipating some sort of disclosure along these lines if not exactly what we heard today from chairman Nunes. One of the reasons that frankly I didn`t join the big pile on in calling President Trump crazy when he tweeted he believed he had been wiretapped in Trump Tower, even though he sort of worded in the a crazy way, is because we`ve been watching very closely the question about why Mike Flynn was fired. General Flynn as the national security adviser had to leave supposedly because he was untruthful about the content of his communications with the Russian ambassador. We learned that through a “Washington Post” story which described him being picked up on surveillance of the ambassador which included people knowing it was him on the phone and knowing what was discussed. We saw the intelligence community, right to the FBI, the CIA and the NSA on March 15, basically demanding to be known how come we all found out that Michael Flynn was on that call? The FBI and the CIA apparently still haven`t responded to the House Intelligence Committee on that and it still remains an outstanding question, doesn`t it, as to whether or not Michael Flynn was properly unmasked as a U.S. person on that warrant? Whether he might have been the subject of a warrant himself or where whether there might have been misconduct in the – his name becoming known, associated with that content?",1,1451.0,254.0,host,35.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
35,SAVAGE," Well, I have to say, as someone paying close attention to surveillance debates and rules and all this stuff for years, I think that is a red herring. Just this morning, the “Wall Street Journal” editorial page had this editorial that went viral because it talked about Trump being a fake president who is clinging to this crazy claim like a drunk to an empty gin bottle, a very strong anti-Trump editorial from a conservative outlet, but embedded in that was this – and he has a legitimate question about why was the government listening to Michael Flynn? And that`s kind of crazy to me. If you pay any attention to this, you should understand that the Russian ambassador of all people walking around the streets of the United States is going to be the target of a wiretap by the FBI for counterintelligence purposes and if the national security advisor to the rising president is – talks to the Russian ambassador, that conversation will be intercepted, they`re listening to the Russian ambassador, he`s talking to someone else, they get both sides of that conversation. And, obviously, what that – what Michael Flynn of all people says to the Russian ambassador and vice versa is foreign intelligence and you need to know who Michael Flynn is to understand it. I do not see based on what the rules are and just a sort of basic understanding of how this works what is alarming about that or maybe alarming is the wrong word. What is mysterious about that, what is hard to understand about that. We think this was a targeting of the Russian ambassador and that`s not remarkable at all in the world.",1,1599.0,284.0,guest,36.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22

Three people died as a result of that, part of the attack on the bridge. Many more were injured, including three police officers. The attacker then sped up and drove directly toward the Houses of Parliament. He crashed into a railing, proceeded to get out of his car. He attacked a police officer inside the gates with a knife.

Police said this evening that the attacker is thought to be, quote, “inspired by international terrorism.” That said, so far, nobody`s taken responsibility and so far, we do not know the name of the attacker.

According to the “A.P.`s” reporting, prior to joining the campaign, Paul Manafort reportedly entered into a $10 million a year contract to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the United States, secretly. I say secretly, because although the “A.P.” has obtained documentation about this business arrangement, including proof of millions of dollars in payments to Paul Manafort, Manafort never registered his work on behalf of a foreign government with the U.S. Department of Justice. The Foreign Agents Registration Act says you have to disclose paid work like that. As the “A.P.” noted in its story today, quote, “willfully failing to register is a felony and can result up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.” I should mention, this is also not the first time that Paul Manafort has been accused of failing to legally disclose work he did on behalf of a foreign power. Last August, in the middle of the presidential campaign, the same “A.P.” reporter from today`s scoop, Jeff Horwitz, also reported that Paul Manafort had failed to disclose his foreign lobbying efforts for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. Joining us is now Jeff Horwitz. He`s the “A.P.” reporter who broke the story earlier today. Mr. Horwitz, I really appreciate your time tonight. I know it`s been a big day explaining this work to everybody. Thanks for being with us tonight.",1,1557.0,258.0,host,45.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22

46,MADDOW," So, I know you don`t want to talk about your sources or your reporting process too much, but what can you explain to us about how this came about, about how you knew to look, for example, for this company that Manafort operated, how you figured out that he might have this kind of a relationship.",1,297.0,57.0,host,47.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
47,HORWITZ," So, I have some very talented colleagues who are working in Moscow, Kiev, Cyprus, all over the place on this stuff. But without getting into sort of the details of reporting and some of the sourcing is confidential, what I can say is that we obtained from a number of different places memos that Manafort wrote to Oleg Deripaska, who is a Russian oligarch very close to Putin. He`s one of the guys that – I mean, according to U.S. diplomatic cables for a number of years back is sort of one of Putin`s top business lieutenants, top allies in the business community. And in these memos, which were sort of associated with this $10 million a year contract that you referenced, Paul Manafort is talking about representing Oleg Deripaska`s personal and business interests abroad and that`s eastern and former Soviet countries, and also in Europe and in the United States, and basically trying to – while the focus was on the post-Soviet countries, trying to make sure that his message was sort of channeled well and through a number of different means to Washington as well.",1,1071.0,188.0,guest,48.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
48,MADDOW," And in the documentation that you found, Manafort explicitly makes the case that this would be a promotion of Putin`s government, that this would be good for Putin`s government specifically.",1,191.0,31.0,host,49.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
49,HORWITZ," Right. And that is – the language was extremely clear on that. That one of the appeals – you know, sort of – and it kind of was a sales pitch from Manafort`s firm to Deripaska. One of the appeals of subsidizing his work or underwriting are the work was that Deripaska would be advancing the interest of the Putin government and thereby ingratiating himself to the Putin government. So, it was very, very straight forward in terms of the pitch. I mean, a big part of it was sort of undercutting political movements that the Putin government would not like in countries neighboring Russia and supporting those that it would.",1,623.0,112.0,guest,50.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
50,MADDOW," Jeff Horwitz, a reporter at “The Associated Press”. Remarkable scoop today. A long story, very easy to understand, very clearly sourced. Thanks for helping us understand it tonight. Appreciate it.",1,197.0,31.0,host,51.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22
51,HORWITZ, Certainly.,1,11.0,2.0,guest,52.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-22

53,MADDOW," They are apparently going to do it. They`re going to hold the vote. House majority leader tells NBC News tonight that by 7:00 p.m. tomorrow, Republicans, in his words, will have passed their bill to repeal Obamacare and throw 24 million Americans off their health insurance. It still does not look at all like the Republicans for sure have the votes they need. They can`t get nor do they appear to want any Democrats` votes. That means their magic number in terms of no votes from Republicans is 21. If 22 Republicans vote no, the bill is dead. NBC has been doing a whip count of no votes. And the list of Republicans who say they`ll vote no tomorrow or are that leaning strongly against the bill tomorrow, right now, is well above 22. It`s 28 say they are no or leaning no. Again, 22 no votes and it`s dead. You have to wonder if that self-imposed 7:00 p.m. deadline is really realistic. But they tell us tonight they`re still going to try for it. Tomorrow is going to be another big day. We will see you again tomorrow. Now, it`s time for “THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL”.

0,"RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST"," Just starting off the show by dropping my pencil. Let`s not take that as a moment about how things are going to go, although you never know. Physical comedy can make for very interesting news sometimes. Let`s start that again, ready? Ahem, hello, happy Tuesday. Thanks for being with us this hour. All right. For a while on Twitter, for a couple years at least on Twitter, if you sent a tweet that included the word “socialist” or that included the word “socialism” or “communist” or “communism,” if you put that word in any tweet, you would get an immediate reply from what looked like the Twitter account of the late Senator Joseph McCarthy. This was the – you see the response there? Not the initial tweet, right? The first tweet is somebody writing “communism defined.” See the response there? You see the little avatar? That`s Joe McCarthy`s face. Joe McCarthy`s face on the Twitter account, if you tweeted anything that said socialism or communism or socialist or communist, that Joe McCarthy beyond the grave Twitter account would tweet back at you and it had tweet at you something like this “creeping socialism.” Or it would say “communist infiltrated.” He was also good at terrible puns. He would say, for example, “on your Marx.” This one is pretty good. “Quit Stalin.” That Twitter account was, of course, not actually Senator Joe McCarthy tweeting from beyond the grave, instead of the Robot J. McCarthy, it was a bot, a Twitter bot. There wasn`t, in fact, a person who was reading every Twitter message sent around the world looking for the word “communism” or “communist” and then writing back with a “Quit Stalin” pun. There wasn`t a person doing that. It was an automated thing. It was a robot, an automated account that was programmed to notice any Twitter mentions of socialism or communism and then it would automatically spit out one of these funny pre-programmed Joe McCarthy nonsense tweets in response. Creeping socialism! It was funny. It was harmless. It was all in good fun. And sadly now, Robot J. McCarthy is defunct, it`s not around anymore. But seeing that bot in action, seeing the fake Joe McCarthy instant response, anything that includes one of those words, that was the first time I really understood how people could automate social media stuff. How you could program what appeared to be a human online that wasn`t really a human to do stuff that ordinary humans didn`t have the capacity to do, right? No individual human could notice and respond to every single mention of the word “socialism” on all of Twitter. But a computer program could. Tirelessly. Forever. Ubiquitously, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, right? Hundreds of thousands, tens of thousands of times, millions of times, why not? And Robot J. McCarthy, that was a funny way to do it. You can see how that bot technology could be used in a less fun way. A less funny, less harmless way. Like, say, during an election season. You can see how people relatively easily could program bots to not just make jokes but to latch on to and respond to and get themselves involved in, for example, any Twitter conversation that mentioned Hillary Clinton, recognize a pro-Hillary Clinton message or a pro-Hillary Clinton hashtag or even just the name “Hillary” or the name “Clinton” and then deluge that mention with fake news stories, with crude remarks, with porn, with lots and lots of pro-Donald Trump commentary, just flood the zone with enough of that stuff and pretty soon, nobody can really have a conversation online about Hillary Clinton at all. If you do that enough, if you get enough bots working that beat, you end up drowning out what would otherwise be normal communication, normal commentary, normal discussion or even normal political organizing. You end up drowning it out in misinformation and noise and insults and just the sheer amount of traffic. And when that noise bomb that comes back at you online is not just loud, it`s outrageous, it`s profane, it`s stuffed with unexpected bits of foreign, it`s relentless, the number of posts that appear back at you and how long they keep going for. Well, in that circumstance you think twice about trying to raise that subject online ever again, right? It makes discussion of the things you care about online. If you are a Hillary Clinton supporter it makes discussion of Hillary Clinton online feel futile. It feels ugly and weird in terms of the response that you get so ultimately overtime, you tune out. You shut down. And if you use Twitter even casually, and if you have an interest in politics, if you use Twitter during the election year, you undoubtedly had a little bit of that experience, or at least observed it, it was ubiquitous. Right after the election in November, researchers at Oxford University published a study of nearly 20 million tweets about the election that were sent over the last week of the presidential contest and those researchers determined after all the traffic on twitter about the U.S. election, bots produce nearly 20 percent of it. During the debate, over a quarter of all election-related Twitter traffic came from these malicious bots and the bot traffic was almost entirely pro-Donald Trump. And some of that dynamic was visible at the time. But now, we are starting to be able to put it together in terms of how Russia used that particular weapon to basically eat American political discourse during our election or at least eat or render useless a big portion of it. And now that the FBI has confirmed that the Trump campaign is the subject of a counterintelligence investigation concerning them possibly cooperating with Russia during Russia`s attack on our election, now we can put it together in terms of the timeline here, right? As we get closer to answering the question of whether or not Russia had help, whether they had confederates inside the Trump campaign when they launched this attack, the timeline is getting really clear now and really interesting in terms of finally getting this thing understood. And you don`t have to go back very far. Just go back one year. As we reported last night, in February of last year, a senior aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a presentation at a Moscow Information Security Forum and in this open source forum, he promised the Russian military and intelligence services had developed what they considered to be the equivalent, the strategic equivalent of a nuclear bomb, but for information warfare. This is a speech that was first reported by David Ignatius at the “Washington Post.” He got the speech translated from Russian. It`s Vladimir Putin`s cyber war senior adviser telling his audience in Moscow last February, quote, “You think we are living in 2016, no, we are living in 1948. Do you know why? Because in 1949, the Soviet Union had its first atomic bomb test, and if until that moment, the Americans were not taking us seriously in 1949, everything changed and they started talking to us on an equal footing. I`m warning you,” he said, “We are on the verge of having something in the information arena that will allow us to talk to the Americans as equals.” So, the Kremlin bragging last year about how they had a new nuclear-level information warfare capability that they were about to deploy against the United States. Something that would bring America down, make America recognize Russia`s strength, make us see them as our equal. That was February of last year. Then in March, we know from the intelligence community`s report on Russia`s attack, in March, Russian military intelligence indeed started their attack. Quote, “The GRU, which is Russian military intelligence, the GRU probably began cyber operations aimed at the U.S. election by March, 2016. We assess –” and this is the U.S. intelligence report on what Russia did. “We assessed that the GRU operations resulted in the compromise of the personal e-mail accounts of Democratic Party officials and political figures.” By May, the GRU had exfiltrated large volumes of data from the DNC. So, again, simple timeline here, right? February, the Kremlin says watch this, watch what we`re about to do here, this is going to be epic what we`re going to do to the United States. That`s in February, following month in March, their military intelligence directorate starts stealing all this propriety political information from the Democratic Party and ultimately by June and July, we know the Russians had shown their hand. That that was not just an intelligence operation, they were not just stealing information from the Democratic Party so they could get American secrets, so they could get secret American information and use it within their own government for their own purposes. Now, by June and July, they showed what they wanted to do with that information was that they wanted to release it publicly in the United States. They wanted to weaponize it. Release it back into our country in a way designed to inflict maximum harm on Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. That`s what they did with D.C. Leaks and Guccifer 2.0 and the secret stuff they stole from the DNC and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. But now we can also tell you that they were also playing another card at the same time, one that a lot of people watching the show experienced in real time and you may not have known what it was when it happened to you. Jason Cherkis and Ryan Grim, two reporters of “Huffington Post,” they have done some great work on this recently. And we`ve been able to add this to the timeline, in part because of stuff we`ve been able to figure out, but also because of what they reported. So, again, the timeline here, February, Kremlin threatening/promising they`re going nuclear in their information war, March, their GRU attacks the Democratic Party and steals their data. We see all the fruits of that by the summer. But that spring, April and May, the other thing they started doing was a huge industrial-sized bot attack. This was not a joke. They used automated social media bots and what appeared to be paid operatives in Russia and other countries specifically to target Bernie supporters. They took the real split in the Democratic Party between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and they blew it up into what they hoped would be an unbreachable chasm. One of the administrators at a Bernie Sanders Facebook page in San Diego described it like this to Grim and Cherkis at “The Huffington Post”, quote, “people with no apparent ties to California were friending his San Fiego Facebook page and sharing links from unfamiliar sites full of anti-Hillary Clinton propaganda. The stories they posted were not the normal complaints. These stories allege that Hillary Clinton had murdered her political opponents and used body doubles. At Sane Progressive, they were posting the same warning. At Bernie Sanders is My Hero, the administrators there were posting their own version of the warning, basically saying something is happening here that is not native to our community. They were warning that these bogus postings were, quote, “developed to be appealing to Berners, to Bernie Sanders supporters, but they were not from an American or Bernie supporting point of view.” The real Bernie supporters in this country, the people who were, for example, running the Facebook pages in support of him by and large, they were trying to stop this when they realized what it was. We see the evidence of that now looking back at it, but even they seem to have realized that their sounding the alarm was futile. People just couldn`t hear it. A few days before the election, John Maddes posted on his San Diego Bernie page, quote, “To all that get news from this page, be advised that groups from Macedonia have infiltrated this page and other Bernie pages, planting fake hate stories about Hillary.” Now, this has been previously reported, previously discussed around the campaign as if that foreign influx of sort of noise and vitriol was all commercial traffic. People in foreign countries who didn`t care about the U.S. election but they`re writing this fake stories basically to troll for clicks, to get gullible U.S. policy junkies, to click on those stories, just because they wanted the ad revenue they could get from clicking on their stories. The ad revenue they could get from traffic they could drive to their site, no matter what nonsense thing they posted. And certainly, there`s a commercial element. That is definitely some of it. But we now understand much more about how Russian intelligence piggybacks on commercial hacking and commercial trolling efforts. It`s part of their M.O., it`s what Russian intelligence does, particularly Russian military intelligence. We also know the Bernie administrators who went through this in real time, at least some of them, don`t believe that what they were going through, that what was washing over their Bernie supporter sites, they don`t necessarily believe that it was people trying to make money off Bernie supporters. John Maddes telling us today, quote, “I strongly believe this was not just a commercial venture. Thirteen million Bernie supporters were out there to potentially support and vote for Hillary. Bernie voters were very engaged, contributed millions and brought in countless new supporters. If you could suppress those voters, you could provide yourself an advantage at low cost.” And now, McClatchy reports that the bot traffic that we see now, we saw in real time without understanding what it was, and we see now clearly what it was in retrospect, McClatchy is now reporting that the bot attacks, the bot traffic is part of the FBI`s counterintelligence investigation into the Russian attack on the election and the question of whether or not there was Trump campaign cooperation in mounting that attack. Quoting for McClatchy, “Operatives for Russia appear to have strategically timed bots to blitz social media with links to pro-Trump stories at times when the billionaire businessman was on the defensive.” Quote, “The bots` end products were largely millions of twitter and Facebook posts with links to stories on conservative Internet sites such as Breitbart news and Info Wars, as well as Kremlin-backed media outlets like RT and Sputnik News.” Federal investigators examining the bot attacks, according to McClatchy, they`re exploring whether the far-right news operations took any actions to assist Russia`s operatives. In other words, were they in on it? Quote, “Investigators examining the bot attacks are exploring whether the far right news operations took any actions to assist Russia`s operatives. The investigation of the bot engineered traffic appears to be in its early stages but it`s being driven by the FBI`s counterintelligence division.” So, if McClatchy sources are correct, we now know that what appeared to be a mysterious tidal wave that turned social media into brainless anti-Clinton mush during the campaign, that was not only part of the Russian attack, it`s part of the Russian attack that is being investigated by the FBI`s counterintelligence division, including the possibility that there was kind of a cooperation or coordination in that part of the attack from pro-Trump forces inside the United States. We will have more on that ahead tonight, including with one of the reporters that broke that story. But I – before we bring that reporter in, I want to leave this on one last point that I think is worth keeping in mind and when I describe this point you are going to think that I`m getting into obscure and into obscure and academic stuff, but you know what? At this point, I`m starting to feel like the obscure and academic stuff is sometimes where the real meat of this story is hiding in plain sight. Very little of this story has been broken by secret information. A lot of the story has been broken, a lot of the story has come into focus by just looking hard enough at what is out there in open sources. OK, so one last point – as the FBI and congressional investigations and journalists continue to authenticate and flesh out just how much Russia did, just exactly what Russia did to us last year and as we continue to get more information about contacts between Trump campaign people and the Russians during the time that the attack was under way, despite the fact that the Trump campaign denied it all these months. As those pieces are falling into place, it`s worth looking at the way the Russians talk about this themselves, because they are proud of their capability in this regard. They really did have a Putin senior adviser last February threaten in public that the United States was about to be humbled and brought down to an equal footing with Russia by a new offensive capability and information warfare that the Russian military was about to unleash against us. They really did do that. They got out in public and pounded their chest about it. Also, their equivalent of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff wrote a public manifesto on Russian military might that is now becoming cult reading in national security circles and among journalists who are trying to figure out this story. He published it in 2013. He said Russia would henceforth use non-military tactics, chiefly information warfare tactics at a 4-1 ratio to its military tactics in its wars. When they went to war from here on out, they would wage four times as much information war as actual kinetic hot shooting war. And in the Russian military`s preeminent journal which is called “Military Thought” in 2014, in a seminal article entitled “Information Operations on the Battlefield”, in that article in 2014, Russian military bragged that if information warfare is going to work, it, quote, “must be conducted constantly, in peacetime, in the period of threats, and in wartime.” If you`re going to use information warfare to confuse, demoralize, divide, distract, and ultimately defeat a rival country, according to the Russians` military doctrine on this subject, you don`t just do it in wartime, you have to do it all the time or it doesn`t work. When “Huffington Post” did their dive into how Bernie supporters got targeted in this Russian attack, they focused in part on a Bernie Sanders Facebook page called “Bernie Sanders Lovers” which says it is based in Burlington, Vermont. It is not based in Burlington, Vermont. It`s based in Albania. and nobody who`s not from Albania appears to have anything to do with that Bernie Sanders site. But the important thing here is that that Bernie Sanders lovers page run out of Albania, it`s still there. Still running. Still operating. Still churning this stuff out. Now. This is not part of American politics. This is not, you know, partisan warfare between Republicans and Democrats. This is international warfare against our country and it did not end on election day. We are still in it. There`s a reason why the investigation here, the counterintelligence investigation here, is something about which there is some urgency. We got more on the new aspect of it that we just learned about today, coming up next.",1,19108.0,3231.0,host,1.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-21
1,MADDOW," I`m about to show you an arresting picture that might make you draw in breath if you haven`t seen it. You may have seen it online in the past couple days but if you haven`t, here goes. Scary looking green man. This is actually a Russia story. This man is Alexei Navalny. He`s the highest profile opposition politician in Russia. He`s planning on running against Vladimir Putin for president of Russia next year. This is not a stunt by him. This is not an attention getting, you know, effort. This weekend, he was campaigning in Siberia, somebody came up to him on the street and threw some sort of chemical all over him that literally dyed him that color, dyed him bright green. Alexei Navalny is making the most of it. He is not hiding, he`s continuing to do public events, make videos, continue with his campaigning, his supporters are saying they will dye themselves green, too, in solidarity with him. But that attack on him, that is a reminder about how Putin`s Russia does business. It`s a reminder how scary it must be to be an opposition figure in Russia right now. And an even scarier reminder of that arrived late this afternoon when we got news that the lawyer for a legendary anti-Putin whistle-blower, the family lawyer for Sergei Magnitsky mysteriously took a header off the fourth floor of his apartment building today in Moscow. Now, there are conflicting reports as to what happened here. He did survive. He`s said to have serious head injuries and is being treated in a hospital. We`ll let you know more as we learn more about it tonight. But I should tell you we`re expecting to speak with somebody close to him who can maybe shed more light on what appears to be another scary attack on an opposition figure in Russia. We`re expecting that interview tomorrow night on this show. I will keep you updated as to the progress of that. Here in the United States, the connection between the Russian attack on our election last year and our own politics is also coming into sharper focus since the FBI announced yesterday that the there is an ongoing counterintelligence investigation into the president`s campaign and to possible coordination with the Russians as they attacked our country last year. Today, Donald Trump`s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was mentioned by a member of the House Intelligence Committee as a potential witness who should perhaps expect too appear before that committee in its investigation. The next thing we heard about Paul Manafort today after that was that Paul Manafort has now hired a crisis management public relations firm. That probably makes sense. The other piece of puzzle that fell into place today was this news from McClatchy, news that the counterintelligence investigation that`s been looking into the Trump campaign since July of last year, according to McClatchy sources, that investigation also now includes investigation specifically into the Russian use of bots and trolls, to spread pro-Trump/anti-Clinton news online both of the real variety and of the made up variety. Greg Gordon is a national correspondent for McClatchy News. He co-bylined that report today with Peter Stone of McClatchy. Mr. Gordon, I`m happy to have you here with us on the show tonight.

6,GORDON, I think it`s partly about the impact of the trolls and bots and it`s also about the possibility that some of these far right news sites might have actually in some way collaborated with Russia as it was endeavoring to unload this enormous cyber attack on the United States.,1,274.0,50.0,guest,7.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-21
7,MADDOW," Now, that possibility, you`re careful in the way you`ve written up that possibility. Obviously, when you look at the overall FBI investigation as characterized by Director Comey, the huge bombshell there is the possibility he raise, which had he says they are investigating that the Trump campaign coordinated, cooperated somehow with this Russian attack on the election. With this piece of it, it is also similarly the real bombshell here as you describe it, the idea that U.S.-based pro-Trump news outlets might have collaborated with the Russians in this part of the attack it doesn`t seem clear that they would have too collaborate in order for that part of the attack to work.

10,GORDON," That`s right. The interesting thing about bots is that bots are just a computer command and you can design a bot to do whatever you want them do. So, in this case, operatives from Russia, they weren`t necessarily all Russians, they might have been in Macedonia or Albania or wherever, were programming commands that would essentially fetch news stories that were favorable to Donald Trump or derogatory about Hillary Clinton, and scatter them all over the place.

He was just telling us we do this one thing, we do this repeal Obamacare care thing and then we conquer the world.

Congressman Chris Collins sounds so sure of this and it`s true his Republican colleagues finally did manage to get through the door way this morning. They did squeeze out. But there`s real reason to question tonight, whether they can get passed what they are calling step one on their plan for universal domination. That story is ahead tonight. Plus, I`ve got to tell you. We`ve got an exclusive look tonight, a first look at something the Democrats are unleashing tomorrow that they think will help them stop the Republicans` efforts to kill Obamacare.

18,MADDOW," Thursday is when the Republicans are going to hold their vote on repealing Obamacare. Ahead of that vote, the president went to Capitol Hill today to twist arms, to line up Republicans to vote for the repeal bill. Congressman Mark Meadows is chairman of the Freedom Caucus. He says that he was a firm no when he walked into the meeting with the president today and he said he was still a firm no when he walked out of that meeting, despite the president reportedly threatening him in front of all the other Republicans in the room. It`s hard to say how many members of the Freedom Caucus are on Mark Meadows` side on this, but even if half the members vote against the bill, that`s it. That`s all it would take, the bill would be toast, game over. NBC has been keeping a whip count of members of the Republican caucus who say they might vote no. So far, 27 Republicans in the house say they are against the bill or strongly leaning against it – 27. That`s over and above the 22 no votes that would be enough to kill the bill. And the pressure isn`t just from the far right guys. It`s coming from the center, too. Moderates have been getting an earful from their constituents at home, warning them not to take Obamacare away. To that point, Democrats have cooked up basically a gut-punch of an ad that they plan to release tomorrow ahead of this week`s vote. We`ve got it exclusively tonight. This is the first add the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee put out in the 2018 election cycle, and we`ve got the first exclusive look at it right here tonight. I think this is pretty good.

In addition to that, former Vice President Joe Biden will be back in Washington tomorrow, trying to shore up Democratic resistance to the repeal bill. He`ll be headlining a rally tomorrow morning on the front steps of the Capitol. Repealing Obamacare has been Republican priority number one for years. We are right now just a little bit over one day away from what`s supposed to be the big vote. It looks shaky, if you look at the NBC whip count. It looks shaky if you look at the political climate around this issue in the country. Already, there are rumblings on Capitol Hill that the House Republicans might push that Thursday vote because they know they don`t have the votes. I have a feeling this is not at all how Republicans thought this would go. None of our candidates is under FBI investigation.",1,929.0,162.0,host,21.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-21

27,MADDOW," We have never had a case like this, Congress, they have never had this before, there`s no event like this that ever took place. Correct, Mr. President. We have never had a sitting president`s campaign under investigation by the FBI for colluding with Russia to influence the election. That has never happened before. It`s uncanny, though, right? That stuff from the campaign? Over and over, throughout the presidential campaign, Republicans insisting if a president was under investigation by the FBI that would – what was the phrase? “Put this country into a major constitutional crisis.” Over and over and over again they said that. But, you know, Sean Spicer, quote, “probably tough to get excited about someone under FBI investigation.” Sean Spicer now White House press secretary. Or this one, quote, “most honest people I know are not under FBI investigation.” Kellyanne Conway, now counselor to the president. Now we know that the president`s campaign is under investigation by the FBI and it`s a counterintelligence investigation about them possibly colluding in a foreign country`s attack on the United States. Started in July, the investigation continues and now we don`t have to imagine what it would be like to have a president under FBI investigation, now we don`t have to wonder about what would be the right response to that, now we have to actually figure out in real time the right response to that because we need the right response to that now. What do we do in this circumstance? Do we pick now to hold hearings to let that president fill a seat on the Supreme Court? Now? A question raised by the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer today.",1,1667.0,283.0,host,28.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-21
28,MADDOW," Senator Schumer went on to say it`s unseemly to be moving forward so fast on the confirmation, quote, “while this big gray cloud of an FBI investigation hangs over the presidency.” But regardless, today was day two of Neil Gorsuch`s confirmation hearings. And the Democrats went, and there`s plenty to say about the balls and strikes of that hearing and how the hearings have been going and all the questions he successfully avoided. But to a certain extent, those things seem like the trees when the forest here is this president is under FBI investigation in a counterintelligence probe. Until that`s sorted out, should we really be going full steam ahead with putting somebody on the Supreme Court for life? Last year, President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to that open seat on the Supreme Court. And the Republicans would not meet with not only wouldn`t hold a hearing – they wouldn`t meet with him. They wouldn`t speak of even considering his nomination. And the Republican objection to Merrick Garland as Supreme Court nominee was, their objection, the – their whole problem with him was that Barack Obama was only going to be president for only a little bit more than a year. So, he`s only got a year left. That`s our objection. So, they`re not going to consider his pick. Right now, the Democratic objection to having hearings on Neil Gorsuch is that the president is under an FBI counterintelligence investigation for potentially colluding with a foreign power to attack the United States. Which of those is a more substantive reason to hit pause and maybe not move forward on giving that particular president the next permanent appointment to the United States Supreme Court? Which of those objections makes more material sense? Joining us now is Dahlia Lithwick, senior editor and legal correspondent for “Slate” and someone who talks me down when my soap box gets too tall. Are you not going to? And then kind of weird with the president who`s actually being investigated, same illegitimacy problem.

30,LITHWICK," But I actually have no problem with what you`re saying. And I would add this one gloss, Rachel, I think it`s not inconsequential. The court`s institutional integrity completely rests on public confidence in the court. It`s not like other positions. The court, if it is under a cloud, under a shadow of some sort, there`s nothing the court can do to get that back. So, this is a different institution from other institutions of government, insofar of all the questions about the legitimacy, the stolen seat now being filled by a stolen presidency. The rest of the republic can recover from this. You know what doesn`t recover? The court. The court really does institutionally suffer when public judgment about the court`s legitimacy is in doubt. It different from other institutions and that really ups the stakes here in a way that it`s beyond just sort of fatuous quoting Ted Cruz.

And I think sort of layered over the sense that this seat was not theirs to take away, it`s just the complete hypocrisy of now insisting they can`t function with eight people, we`ve got to get this done now. And moreover, this is an institution that really rests on integrity and dignity and civility. You know, you`re hearing Senate Republicans talking about the need to return to norms now. Norms?

4,MADDOW," Very good. And thanks to you at home for joining us for this hour. Happy to have you with us on a really historic day in American politics and American governance and maybe even in international relations today. Today was a big day. In 1945, in the summer of 1945, they called it the gadget. They tested the gadget on July 16th, 1945, and it worked. That was Trinity. That was the world`s first successful test of an atomic weapon. And then right away, right after Trinity, three weeks later, they used it in war. They dropped it an atomic bomb on Hiroshima and then three days after that, they dropped another one on Nagasaki. It all happened incredibly fast from July 16th, the Trinity test, until August 6th and August 9th, those two bombs dropped on Japan. And to this day, the United States remains the only nation in the world to have ever used a nuclear weapon against an adversary in wartime. But looking back on the aftermath of that first test and the aftermath of those bombings in Japan, it`s clear that a singular and defining feature of the world history in that era was not just that we have the bomb and that we use the bomb. A singular and defining feature of that era in world history is that for years, we were alone in that capacity. For years, the United States was the only country on earth that had an atomic weapon. Again, our first atomic test was July 1945. It was not until more than four years after that that any other country figured it out, that any other country had a successful nuclear test of their own. But it finally happened on August 29th, 1949. Soviet Union set off their first successful atomic test and it`s interesting. They didn`t make any sort of announcement about it. I think they knew they probably wouldn`t have to. The United States picked up signs of the radiation that was released by that test five days after the explosion. There was a U.S. surveillance plane flying near Siberia and five days after the Soviets first successful atomic test, that U.S. surveillance plane picked up these unexpected signs of radiation and so, the U.S. collected what data we could, U.S. scientists set out to confirm the suspected tests and then finally almost three weeks after that surveillance plane first sniffed that radiation in Siberia, almost a month after the Soviet`s test, finally, the president of the United States, Harry Truman put out a statement letting the world know that somebody else other than the United States had nuclear capability. It was a written statement that he put out. It said, quote, “We have evidence that within recent weeks, an atomic explosion occurred in the USSR.” That statement from President Truman was issued on September 23rd, 1949. And as you might imagine, everybody freaked out.",1,2762.0,488.0,host,5.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20
5,REPORTER," Mr. Vyshinsky, do you got a statement about President Truman`s statement about the atomic bomb? Does Russia have the atomic bomb?",1,130.0,22.0,guest,6.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20
6,UNIDENTIFIED MALE, The Russian foreign minister maintains his silence.,1,52.0,8.0,guest,7.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20
7,MADDOW," Does Russia have the atomic bomb? Well, would you reply to me? Russian foreign minister maintained his silence in that interaction and in his speech that day, honestly, because actions speak louder than words and you know what, the Soviets freaking had the bomb. It was not just the U.S. with that monopoly anymore. Every interaction with the Soviets that we would have from that moment forward would be made with the knowledge that they could destroy Washington with a nuke just as we could destroy Moscow with a nuke, just as we had destroyed two Japanese cities already. It changed everything. We were not a monopoly power in terms of nuclear weapons from that point forward. Russia went nuclear in the fall of 1949 and incidentally, very soon thereafter, by the spring of 1950, one of the scientists who worked on America`s Manhattan Project, Klaus Fuchs, confessed and was convicted of passing America`s nuclear secrets to the Soviets. So, yes, that weapon that the Soviets developed four years after us, that weapon that they developed and tested in 1949, it was a great equalizer between Russia and the United States. It really did change everything in terms of the international balance of power. But it`s helpful to remember that they actually had help from within the United States in getting there. Klaus Fuchs was sentenced to 14 years in prison for that betrayal, for giving the Soviets our nuclear secrets. Last year, in February, in Moscow, the Russian government hosted something that they called Info Forum 2016. David Ignatius is the national security columnist with “The Washington Post” who wrote about this earlier this year, but the event itself happened last February, February 4th to 6th in Moscow. So, in terms of what was going on for reference sake, this Info Forum event in Moscow happened, again, the first week of February last year. That means on our calendar, that was right at the beginning of the presidential primary. That was well before the presidential general election got under way, but our contests had just started. And at that event, the first week of February last year, a senior adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin got up to make his presentation and this is what he said. He was speaking to a Russian audience at a Russian event. He was speaking in Russian. But this is the translation, quote, “You think we are living in 2016. No, we are living in 1948. And do you know why? Because in 1949, the Soviet Union had its first atomic bomb test. And if until that moment, the Americans were not taking us seriously, in 1949, everything changed and they started talking to us on an equal footing.” He then says, quote, “I`m warning you, we are on the verge of having something in the information arena that will allow us to talk to the Americans as equals.” “I`m warning you,” he says, that was February of last year. Top adviser to Vladimir Putin, threatening at a Russian event that Russia had developed its information warfare capabilities to such an extent that the world would soon be tilted on its axis in terms of the balance of international power, that the United States would not longer be seen as a pre-eminent world power. In fact, we would be matched. Russia was about to prove through information warfare, through something new they had developed in information warfare, they were about to prove that they were as strong as any nation on earth, that they could humble the United States, they could threaten the United States to such an extent that it would allow them to, quote – it would tell them to, quote, “allow us to talk to the Americans as equals.” “It will allow us to talk to the Americans as equals. I`m warning you.” That was February. By June, we know that Russia had begun its operation against the U.S. presidential election. From the FBI director, we now have confirmation that the FBI started investigating that Russian attack within weeks. By late July, by which time the attack was in full swing. We also have confirmation from the FBI director today that what is currently being investigated by the FBI is not just whether the Russian intelligence services and Russian military built that weapon and deployed it against the United States, that much we know, but we`ve had it confirmed today that what they are also investigating is whether, once again, the Russians had help from inside the United States when it came time to humble America and show our country what they are capable of.",1,4471.0,776.0,host,8.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20
8,"JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR"," The FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government`s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia`s efforts. As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.",1,494.0,71.0,guest,9.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20
9,MADDOW," Whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia`s efforts. That statement by the FBI director today obviously very carefully couched. By the time he said it, it could not have counted as a, you know, total surprise. But it is still shocking. This is a historic thing. As “USA Today”, Susan Page at “USA Today” put it, this afternoon, quote, “Not since the Watergate scandal that forced President Richard Nixon to resign more than half-century ago has there been an official investigation of such potential consequence.” At moments this big, it also sometimes helps to get outside our news environment and kind of look in on it from behind our shores. Toward that end, the left-leaning “Guardian” newspaper in Britain sort of nutted up the moment nicely today. They said, quote, “Comey`s appearance, flanked by the NSA director, marked a remarkable and unprecedented threshold in U.S. political history, putting beyond doubt that a sitting president`s entourage was under investigation for possible conniving with a foreign adversary to put that foreign in power.” The hearing today was at times incisive, at times, it was lame and embarrassingly partisan. Sorry. My favorite moment was when the Republican chairman of the committee demanded that Hillary Clinton must be investigated for Donald Trump`s ties to the Russians? Yes, I don`t know. Sorry. Just a reflex. Lock her up. But, you know, despite low moments like that, not everything was partisan and we did learn some concrete new information. We have confirmed now that the FBI has an ongoing counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign and whether or not the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia while Russia was attacking the United States. We know that that investigation started in late July last year. We know from some very pointed questioning from the top Democratic on the intelligence committee, Adam Schiff is going to be here in just a moment. We know from his questioning of Director Comey that one of the things we reported on Friday night is borne out by the FBI`s investigations. We did this special report on Friday night where we talked to the guy who was in charge of these matters in real time at the Clinton campaign when the attack was happening. And we reported on Friday night that it was the Clinton campaign`s perception at the time that the initial dump of Democratic documents, Democratic Party documents that were stolen by the Russians, it was their perception that that was sort of inexpertly and ham-handedly released and handled by the Russians themselves. The second release of documents, though, the one that was through WikiLeaks, was much slicker and appeared to have been handled through some sort of intermediary, some sort of intermediary, some sort of third party who sharpened its political impact both in terms of its timing and its presentation, its user-friendliness. That was as reported Friday night, suspected by the Clinton campaign at the time. The FBI director confirmed today that, in fact, the initial release of documents that the Russians hacked and stole and released through Guccifer and D.C. Leaks, that the FBI director today confirmed that it was a Russian operation directly. He confirmed today that the second wave of WikiLeaks stuff, according to Director Comey, he says those were done through what he called a cutout, some sort of intermediary. So, what we`re beginning to understand about how this happened, the FBI is confirming that`s the way it happened. In general, I think it`s fair to say that the Republican members of the committee contributed less to the investigatory nature of what happened today in this public hearing, but it is also worth noting one exception to that rule. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen is a moderate Republican from Florida. She did not go down the other roads, you know, investigate Hillary Clinton. She didn`t go down these other roads with the other Republicans. She was an independent voice today. She asked her own variety of direct, probing questions with most of the time that she had. And her questioning elucidated another one of the concrete new things that we learned today or at least that we had confirmed today by the FBI and the NSA, and it`s something that really makes sense, if Russia wanted not just to affect the outcome of our elections, they wanted this to be a show of force. They wanted this to be, you know, the test of an atomic bomb. They wanted this to be a display of their capability that would threaten the United States, hurt the United States, humble the United States and make us see them as equals, right? They didn`t want anybody else to get credit for this work. They didn`t particularly want to cover their tracks here. They did this – one of the things we had confirmed today by the FBI and NSA director is that the Russians did this in as loud of ways as possible when it came to the actual tactics of how they mounted the attack.",1,4950.0,839.0,host,10.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20
10,COMEY," I don`t know the answer for sure. I think part, their number one mission is to undermine the credibility of our entire democracy enterprise of this nation. And so, it might be that they wanted us to help them by telling people what they were doing. Their loudness in a way would be counting on us to amplify it by telling the American people what we saw and freaking people out about how the Russians might be undermining our elections successfully.",1,450.0,82.0,guest,11.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20
11,MADDOW," People freaking out. Essentially making the case there that the Russians didn`t mind leaving their fingerprints all over this attack because they wanted to freak us out about what they are capable of. Back in February, in Moscow when Putin`s senior adviser was explaining to this Russian audience about Moscow`s newfound soon-to-be demonstrated capabilities in information warfare, this moment that we`re having right now, this is kind of the moment that Russia was licking its chops about. This is what they were looking forward. I`m going to quote David Ignatius again about that presentation in Moscow back in February, quote, “Putin`s cyber adviser stressed to the Moscow audience the importance of Russia of having a strong hand in this new domain. If Russia is weak, he explained, it must behave hypocritically and search for compromises. But once it becomes strong, it will dictate to the Western partners, it will dictate to the United States and its allies from the position of power.” And so, Russian strength, Russian capability, Russian – essentially Russian warfare capacity in this regard must be shown off, right, to humble us, to bring us down to size, so that they can then dictate the size of national relations to us. They can get us to do what they want, because if they don`t, they can almost existentially threaten us with this kind of power. If that is the Russian project here, it sort of helps you to see how serious it is that any American might collude with that Russian project. The FBI confirmed today that they are investigating the Trump campaign to see whether or not they coordinated with the Russian government in this operation. The FBI today would not say how many associates of the president or members of the campaign are subjects of this counterintelligence investigation. The FBI director would not even confirm whether the president himself is a subject of this investigation. But you are starting to see little hints from the White House about some of the different directions at which they maybe would like to divert blame. Asked, for example, about fired National Security Adviser Michael Flynn today, the White House press secretary notably stopped defending Mike Flynn as he has done in the past and in fact at one point today referred to Mike Flynn as a, quote, “volunteer”. You know, which he was, right? He was a volunteer for the Trump campaign for a time. OK. But then he was named national security adviser. The White House press secretary also described former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort today as somebody who played a, quote, “very limited role for a very limited amount of time.” He was the campaign manager for Donald Trump, up to and including the time when Donald Trump won the Republican nomination for president. Paul Manafort was brought onboard the Trump campaign in March last year, third week of March, almost exactly a year ago today. He was brought on board on the same week that Trump the candidate inexplicably and without warning started talking frequently about how terrible he thought NATO was.",1,3076.0,519.0,host,12.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20
12,"DONALD TRUMP, THEN-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE"," NATO is obsolete. It was 67 years or it`s over 60 years old. What I`m saying is NATO is obsolete. NATO is obsolete and it`s extremely expensive to the United States disproportionally so, and we should readjust NATO. NATO is costing us a fortune and, yes, we are protecting Europe with NATO, but we`re spending a lot of money. Number one, I think the distribution of cost has to be changed.",1,390.0,72.0,guest,13.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20
13,MADDOW," Look at the time. The same week that Paul Manafort came on as Donald Trump`s campaign manager, Trump pivoted to this whole new area of talking points. He started insistently and repeatedly volunteering his negative views on NATO, how terrible and obsolete NATO is and his views specifically that, you know what, NATO isn`t fair. The other NATO countries are not paying their fair share, are they? And whether or not the White House is now already pivoting to throwing Paul Manafort, maybe even Mike Flynn under the bus, it`s not inexplicable why candidate Trump might start criticizing NATO at that point in the campaign and sowing distension and division among NATO countries, hitting this potential sore spot about whether the United States pays too much and other countries don`t pay enough. It`s not inexplicable why candidate Trump might start doing that. I mean, the uncorroborated dossier of alleged Russian dirt on Donald Trump that was published by “BuzzFeed” in January after handed over to the FBI by a former British MI6 officer, that dossier made, of course, a baseline claim that the Trump campaign was aware of the Russian campaign to attack our election. They were supportive of it. They cooperated with it. It also claims that there was a quid pro quo, that in exchange for Russia`s attack on the election to hurt Clinton and help Trump, according to the dossier, quote, “The operation had been conducted with the full knowledge and support of Trump and senior members of his campaign team. In return, the Trump campaign had agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue, and to raise U.S./NATO defense commitments, to deflect attention away from Ukraine.” So, in the Christopher Steele dossier, I mean, that`s the alleged quid pro quo. Russia attacks the U.S. election for its own purposes, right, but then it also coops, corrupts and collaborates with the Trump campaign in that attack, and the Trump campaign allegedly agrees to take steps to help Russia along the way, drop that pro-Ukraine platform out of the Republican – the pro-Ukraine plank out of the Republican Party platform, which they did at the convention, inject a whole new controversy into American and NATO politics, instead of America being NATO`s biggest cheerleader, will instead be its biggest detractor while make every other country feel attacked in terms of their financial contributions to that alliance. This is the stuff that the ranking Democratic on the intelligence committee, Adam Schiff, this weekend, described as the circumstantial evidence, that it wasn`t just a Russian attack. That it was a Russian attack with collusion, with cooperation from inside this country, from inside the Trump campaign. We simply don`t know. Not yet. And we owe it to the country to find out.",1,2801.0,464.0,host,14.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20

15,SCHIFF," We do not yet know whether the Russians had the help of U.S. citizens, including people associated with the Trump campaign. Many of the Trump`s campaign personnel, including the president himself, have ties to Russia and Russian interests. This is, of course, no crime. On the other hand, if the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it aided or abetted the Russians, it would not only be a serious crime, it would also represent one of the most shocking betrayals of democracy in history. In Europe, where the Russians have a much longer history of political interference, they`ve used a variety of techniques to undermine democracy. They employed the hacking and dumping of documents and sick propaganda as they clearly did here, but they have also used bribery, blackmail, compromising material and financial entanglement to secure needed cooperation from individual citizens of targeted countries.",1,905.0,145.0,guest,16.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20

18,MADDOW," I`d like to tell you what I observed a little bit in terms of new factual information we didn`t have before and if you could just let me know whether there are other things that we`ve missed in terms of new things that were disclosed. Obviously, the headline is that the FBI has confirmed a counterintelligence investigation into the Russian attack and potential coordination with the Trump campaign. We know it started in late July. We also have the FBI and NSA confirming their assessment that the Russians did this loudly and didn`t particularly try to cover their tracks. The FBI director also told you that it appears that the Russians directly released the first tranche of stolen documents that they had, but the second one through WikiLeaks appears to have some sort of intermediary. All of those pieces of information to me were sort of nuggets that I drew out of today`s 5 1/2 hour hearing. But I wonder if there are other things that you saw today that have been publicly disclosed now for the first time.",1,1017.0,180.0,host,19.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20
19,SCHIFF," You know, I`m not sure that I can point to any others but, you know, I would say this with respect to Director Comey`s discussion of the Russians loudly making their presence known. I`m not sure that I would draw that same conclusion and part of this is the question of what the Russians intended at the outset, that it may very well be when they first penetrated the Democratic Party computers, it was merely a foreign intelligence gathering operation and they didn`t feel the necessity of very cleverly hiding their tracks because it`s something the Russians have also done in terms of foreign intelligence gathering. But when they decided to move to the weaponization of that data, that had become more important for them to hide their tracks, then they needed more plausible deniability in terms of the platforms that they would use to publish the material. So, I`m not sure it is as simple as the Russians were intending to send us a signal here. That`s possible. I think it may be more likely that the Russians were either clumsy or what started out as an information gathering purpose later turned into something different.",1,1131.0,197.0,guest,20.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20
20,MADDOW," On the point of the Russians releasing the information themselves, the Guccifer and D.C. Leaks release of information versus the Russians using an intermediary for later releases of documents, including through WikiLeaks, what`s your understanding of the importance there or the basis for that conclusion?",1,306.0,46.0,host,21.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20
21,SCHIFF," Well, I can`t go too much beyond what the director talked about today, but, you know, it`s clear that in some cases, they have a more direct relationship or essentially the persona like Guccifer 2.0 is a reflection of the Russian GRU. There`s not much distance, if any, between the personnel that are collectively the identity of Guccifer 2 and Russian intelligence itself. In other cases, where they wanted more deniability, more distance they used a platform like WikiLeaks. Now, whether they directly engaged Julian Assange or indirectly, one thing is pretty clear, not only does Donald Trump have a hard time criticizing Russia, so does Julian Assange. And why is that? Is there some relationship there? I don`t know the answer but I do think it`s worth our finding out.",1,775.0,132.0,guest,22.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20
22,MADDOW," Congressman, on NBC yesterday, you said that you see there being an accumulation of what you`ve described as circumstantial evidence, that there was collusion between this Russian operation and associates of Donald Trump during the campaign. Can you just expand on that a little bit, what you meant by circumstantial evidence and both the limits of that and also the extent of it?",1,381.0,64.0,host,23.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20
23,SCHIFF," Well, you know I know when you use that term, a lot of people think circumstantial evidence isn`t very telling. It isn`t very powerful. But it all depends on what kind of circumstantial evidence. I can`t go into a lot of specifics here. But probably the best example for your viewers is, if you go outside in the afternoon and there`s no snow on the ground and you wake up the next morning and there is snow on the ground, you can pretty well conclude that it snowed overnight. That`s circumstantial. If you see the snow coming down, then you can say I have direct evidence that it snowed. So circumstantial evidence can be very, very powerful and indicative of something that`s happened. And here, you know, I think we can say certainly that the director made clear today that he had a basis in specific or credible information or evidence to initiate an investigation of the Trump campaign. That`s not something that you do lightly or at the drop of a hat or on a whim or someone suggesting, you know, third-party hearsay. No, as the director made clear, you not only need to have a certain quantum of evidence, but it has to be a high enough priority to supersede other investigations that you can`t do at the same time because of lack of resources. So, this was obviously a big deal and I think we also can see some very direct evidence of deception, which raises profound questions about why are they hiding what they are hiding and why did Michael Flynn lie about his conversation with the Russian ambassador and why wasn`t Jeff Sessions more forthcoming to put it charitably with the Senate about his meetings with the Russian ambassador? What about Paul Manafort, why did he lie about the Trump campaign rule in fending off an amendment at the Republican Party convention that would have provided for defensive weapons for Ukraine? Why all of the deception? If this is aboveboard, why do they need to hide it and I think certainly those are important questions to answer.",1,1980.0,353.0,guest,24.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20

This would be his first NATO meeting, again “Reuters” citing U.S. officials says that Secretary Tillerson is going to skip that NATO meeting next month. Don`t worry, though, he won`t be house-bound. “Reuters” also reporting tonight that Secretary Tillerson is not going to NATO next month, but he is now planning a visit to Russia next month. The State Department had no comment for “Reuters”. Again, this is not MSNBC reporting. This is “Reuters”. But it has just broken within the last few minutes.

29,MADDOW," The issue of NATO and the United States playing up divisions among NATO countries, playing down any concern about Russia`s incursions into Ukraine, that was raised in this mysterious dossier from a former MI6 officer as essentially the quo in a quid pro quo between the Russians and the Trump campaign. The allegation was there that the Trump campaign knew about Russian intervention in the election, cooperated with it or aware that it was going on and what they promised to do in return was to downplay Ukraine, sow dissension in NATO. You raised that today in today`s hearing. And I wonder if that means – if we should read into that. When you cited with that dossier, should we stop describing that as an uncorroborated dossier? Has some of the information of that been corroborated?",1,788.0,137.0,host,30.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20
30,SCHIFF," Well, you know, Rachel, I can`t go through the dossier and disclose what we may have been able to corroborate or not, but I can say just in response to the “Reuters” story, that I have to hope that that story is not true. We`ve already sent a terrible message to NATO. The only message frankly that has gotten through of this administration to NATO is not that we support you, not that we value you, not that we thank our NATO allies for coming to our assistance in Afghanistan and Iraq where NATO soldiers have stood by, fought by and died with our own troops but rather pay up. That`s the only message we`ve delivered. And if Rex Tillerson is going to avoid going to the NATO meeting and instead go to Moscow, I hope the reason he`s going to Moscow is to hand back the Special Order Friendship medal he got from Putin because after what the Russians have done to us over the course of the last year, that`s the only reason Tillerson ought to be going to Russia.",1,964.0,183.0,guest,31.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-20

36,MADDOW," Republican Congressman Vern Buchanan of Florida had that giant town hall on Saturday, facing 1,800 of his constituents. And they were not shy and there were a bunch like that over the last couple of days. In Novi, Michigan, after not holding a town hall for two years, Republican Congressman Dave Trott finally faced his constituents. It`s quite possible that he was tired of them calling him a chicken. There were only 400 seats inside the Novi, Michigan town hall, but about 1,000 people showed up. The people who couldn`t get inside that one stuck around in a freaking blizzard. Look at that. They did not leave even though they were stuck out there in the snow. Michiganders are hard core. Also, in a red pocket of northern California, 1,300 constituents turned out for a town hall with Republican Congressman Doug LaMalfa. Those folks were happy to wait out in the rain. The line to get into his town hall stretched for over half a mile, well over 1,000 people. That red arrow is where the line starts.

It took to the streets this weekend, one of the busiest intersections in town. Again, this is Nebraska. People organized in part by their local Indivisible group. People showing up, getting in the way. Honestly, it is almost bizarre that the Trump agenda, the Trump Supreme Court nominee are being considered right now, steaming towards votes while the president`s campaign is the subject of a counterintelligence investigation to see if it colluded in an attack on the United States last year. It`s weird that they still get to do stuff while that is happening. But things proceed apace and Americans are speaking up about it and trying to affect the course of events. House Republicans plan to hold their vote on repealing Obamacare on Thursday of this week. NBC News has drawn a whip count on that vote. So far, they`re confirming 17 House Republicans will vote no on the Obamacare repeal. That 17 number is important. If they get to 22 “no” votes, it`s dead. Even just in the House. It already appears to be dead once it tries to get to the Senate but they could kill it in the House, too. This is – this is a volatile time.

38,MADDOW," You know Chris Hayes, right? My buddy, Chris. Show before mine. He wrote a book in 2012 called “The Twilight of the Elites.” The basic thesis of this very good was that elite institutions of all kinds were losing their luster in this country. Elite institutions were not just failing, they were increasingly being rejected by the American people. Very interesting thesis, very well reported and argued. It also sounded a little bit of an alarm in that book again, 2012 is when the book came out and he warned in this book that one of the consequences of the twilights of the elites, twilight of elite institutions, including the government and media and all the rest, one of the consequences of that would likely be increasing interest in our country in a new form of American authoritarianism, an anti-elite, anti-academic, burn down the establishment authoritarian impulse of the kind we haven`t really enjoyed in this country before now. Nailed it. Called it. Four years in advance. Nailed it. That was his first book. Now, Chris has written a second book. And I`m also scared of this one. It`s called “A Colony in a Nation.” Title actually comes from Nixon, comes from Nixon`s acceptance speech of the 1968 Republican convention. It was Nixon`s law and order speech. But in that speech, he warned against black America becoming a colony within a nation. In his new book, Chris takes that argument and turns it completely inside-out, argues that in many ways that is exactly what happened but not the way Nixon meant it. And Chris argues that this did happen in large part because of how the law has been used to impose order. Quoting from Chris, “The terrifying truth is that we as a people have created the colony through democratic means. We have voted to subdue our fellow citizens. We have rushed to the polls to elect people promising to bar others from enjoying the fruits of liberty. A majority of Americans have put a minority under lock and key.” It is a terrifying, fascinating, well-told short, interesting book. Unlike “Twilight of the Elites,” though, this one does not necessarily offer us a plan for getting out of it.

There`s an appeal to the idea of particularly if you were experiencing decline, particularly if you`re experiencing a kind of unraveling, there`s an idea that, like, we can contain it, keep it over there, we can send in the guards, we can send in the cops and they can keep that disorder contained and you are going to be secure and you are going to be okay.

And then all the other stuff is here in the prefrontal cortex. And when you`re like, I don`t know, making a television show, or trying to get clicks on a website, there`s this appeal of the brain stem. There are a lot of examples. I mean, here in New York City, there was an election to end stop and frisk, I mean, which that was overwhelmingly ratified and same echoes of fear, fear, fear, like crime is going to go right back up. And it did not. I think that was a sort of powerful and important test moment. But we`ve also seen the inverse, right? We`ve seen the president of the United States warning that America is, you know, misquoting the homicide statistics, we`re going back to the bad old days, that chaos and violence and ruin are just knocking on the door and if we turn away from this very punitive model that we`ve been deploying for 40 years, we will allow this disorder into our lives and that retains its power.

Today was day one of the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. Tomorrow, the questioning portion of the hearings will start. We don`t yet exactly know what path Democrats will focus on with Gorsuch. There`s also the question of why Democrats are there at all for the hearing. Today, a lot of the Democrats on the committee highlighted the fact that President Obama`s nominee for that seat, Merrick Garland, never got a hearing in the Senate. That question is still unanswered and looming over all of this. Why are the Democrats participating in a process that Republicans would not allow under President Obama? But nevertheless, tomorrow`s hearing begins at 9:30 a.m. Eastern. You, of course, can watch it all here on live on MSNBC. That does it for us tonight. We will see you again tomorrow.

4,MADDOW," Thank you, Chris. Appreciate it. And thanks to you at home for joining us for the next hour. You may have heard we`ve got some significant breaking news tonight. Donald Trump`s tax returns have surfaced – at least a portion of Donald Trump`s past tax returns. What we have tonight has been turned the over to a reporter. These are returns for one year. It`s a federal return. This is the first time we believe any federal tax returns for Donald Trump have been obtained by anyone, certainly by any news organization since he became a presidential candidate let alone president. And tonight, we have their first look at what they`re they have obtained. In just a second, we are going to show you exactly what it is we`ve got. We`re going to walk through it with David cay Johnston. We`re going to get context on it. We`re going to get some explanation of what it means. Importantly, we`re going to get explanation and discussion about what further avenues for reporting this may open. But let me tell you first that part of what`s very important about this story, about this new document we`re able to bring into public discussion, part of what`s most important about it is that for some reason that we cannot discern, this document has been made available. This document has surfaced. It has been handed to a reporter and that`s an important part of this story. That may be the most important part of this story. When Donald Trump declared as a presidential candidate that he would not release his tax returns, he became the first president since the Watergate era to refuse to release his returns. When Richard Nixon said, “I`m not a crook”, he wasn`t talking about Watergate. He was talking about his taxes. And, in fact, he was kind of a crook in his taxes. He handed them over in 1973. In April, 1974, the IRS ordered him to pay almost a half million dollars in back taxes because, in fact, President Nixon had taken improper deductions and he hadn`t paid enough. I mean, that was the least of his problems in the end but that was, in fact, one of his problems. And presidents and presidential candidates have released their taxes ever since. Donald Trump`s opponent in the presidential campaign this past year, Hillary Clinton, she released every year of her tax returns back to 1977. But Donald Trump refused to release any. He made history by insisting that he would not, that indeed he could not release his tax returns. And it never much made sense on factual grounds. When candidate Donald Trump said he would love to release his tax return but he couldn`t because his tax returns were under audit, that never made sense because even the initial precedent for presidents releasing their tax returns, even Richard Nixon, was under audit when he released his tax returns and since we later learned he was cheating on his taxes, it seemed like that was an audit well spent. The IRS has let it be known that there`s no legal reason why somebody under audit can`t release their taxes. And, in fact, since Watergate, every single president and every single vice president has been audited by the IRS every year of their time in office. And they all still routinely release their tax returns to the public every year. So, that excuse from Trump and the Trump campaign, it never made sense. Being under audit is not excuse for not releasing your tax returns as a candidate or certainly as president. Also, the audit excuse never made sense for his past tax returns. I mean, even if Donald Trump wanted to release nothing under current audit – well, what about years for which the audits are completed and closed? I mean, any year of his taxes before, say, 2008, any year that was audited before then, those years would presumably be done being audited by now. Those would be closed. So, why not release those earlier tax returns even if you don`t want to release the current ones for which there isn`t really an excuse not to do anyway? Whether or not you are a supporter of Donald Trump in general, whether or not you care what`s in his tax returns, it ought to give you pause that his explanation for why he couldn`t release them, why he has to make history by being the first person in decades to hold this office without releasing them, it ought to give you pause that his explanations have never made any factual sense. I mean, think about it. The “I`m under audit” excuse makes no sense. And if the “I`m under audit” excuse doesn`t make any sense, then what does explain why the president hasn`t released tax returns? When you get an excuse from them that doesn`t make sense, you have to look for another reason. All right. The stated explanation here makes no sense. What`s the real explanation? Well, choose your own adventure. Here`s an example. This is a home that Donald Trump purchased for just over $40 million in 2004. Less than four years later, a Russian oligarch paid him almost $100 million for that same house. Could Trump tax returns shed light on whether any reasonable outlay of expenses on Trump`s part might explain why somebody would suddenly want to pay Donald Trump more than double what he paid for that property after only a few years, at a time when housing prices were dropping and not rising? I mean, if this wasn`t just some Russian oligarch dumping almost $60 million into Donald Trump`s pocket for no discernible reason, couldn`t Trump tax returns clear that up? Wouldn`t Trump`s taxes show whatever reasonable real estate inflow and outflow might explain what otherwise really does look like a bizarre dump of tens of millions of dollars of Russian money into Donald Trump`s coffers? Right at a time when Donald Trump owed tens of millions of dollars to Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Bank was breathing down his neck to get it? That Russian oligarch who spent that money on that property and never moved into it and ultimately tore it down, he`s also a large shareholder in a bank called the Bank of Cyprus, which has been implicated in Russian money laundering. The chairman of the Bank of Cyprus is the former CEO of Deutsche Bank, to which Donald Trump owed all that money at the time he conveniently got this very large influx of cash from a Russian guy. The vice chairman of that bank until recently was our new secretary of commerce, long time Trump friend, Wilbur Ross. Couldn`t the tax returns sort this out for us? If there are inexplicable dumps of foreign money into the president`s coffers that cannot be explained in normal business terms, that`s potentially a huge problem for somebody who`s serving as president of the United States, right? I mean, the interest in Trump`s tax returns is not a picayune thing. It`s not a partisan thing. If people, if interests have inexplicably given him a lot of money in recent years, why did they do it? What do they want for that money now? Is the president in a position where we need to watch to make sure he is not paying off his past benefactors with our country`s resources, with U.S. policy, with decisions he can make as president? That`s part of why we need to see his tax returns. And I raise this issue of this particular Russian oligarch, Dmitry Rybolovlev, I`ve been practicing, Rybolovlev. Rybolovlev. Rybolovlev? Rybolovlev. Dmitry Rybolovlev, the guy who paid Trump all that money for that house. I raise him only as an example because we haven`t had any meaningful financial disclosures, any tax returns from the president, and because of that, this Russian oligarch is one of the continuing sources of intrigue about whether our president now has foreign ties that could conceivably be motivating his actions as president. And I say it`s ongoing concerns because it`s ongoing concerns. It`s not just interesting stuff that happened in his past that we have to worry about in the past. I mean, during the presidential campaign, Dmitry Rybolovlev`s private plane was spotted at least twice at local airports when Donald Trump campaign events were happening nearby. At least once, his private plane was spotted on the tarmac right alongside Donald Trump`s private plane while Donald Trump was doing a campaign even. Rybolovlev insists to us that that is a coincidence. But tonight, the “Palm Beach Post” reports that this weekend, Rybolovlev`s yacht was parked alongside the yacht that`s owned by Robert Mercer, who is the single largest financial backer of the Trump for president effort, the single largest financial backer of Breitbart and the person who basically installed both Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon at the top of the Trump campaign after Paul Manafort was fired for his ties to Russia and Ukraine. Dmitry Rybolovlev denies to us tonight that he has had anything to do with Robert Mercer or with Donald Trump other than paying him almost $60 million over the price Trump paid for that house. But once you`re the president of the United States, the people of the United States need to know if you`ve got significant unexplained sources of income, particularly of income that has a foreign origin. Hence the need to see Trump`s tax returns. Hence the appetite for it. Has he received money from foreign sources? Has he received loans from foreign sources? One of the things you have to declare on your U.S. federal taxes is whether you have paid taxes in foreign countries. Does the president have foreign bank accounts? If so, which banks? The more I know about the Bank of Cyprus, for example, the more I want to know about whether there are other ties, other Trump ties to that troubled bank aside from his hand-picked commerce secretary and the guy who inexplicably paid him that money for that house and the newly installed chairman from the bank that holds more of his debt than any other financial institution. When the Trump administration, when the president and his attorney general inexplicably moved on Friday to fire all of the U.S. attorneys, all of a sudden, on Friday, no warning, “get out, you`re done by midnight” – the Preet Bharara firing in New York was of note and particular concern because President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions had both previously told Preet Bharara he could continue to hold that job. It is a particularly newsworthy firing that they did an unexplained U-turn on that because of Bharara`s jurisdiction. Bharara`s office is pursuing a federal case against Deutsche Bank for Russian money laundering. That office also has jurisdiction, geographical jurisdiction over Trump Tower and the Trump Organization. Ethics watchdogs last week wrote to Preet Bharara, asking him to investigate whether the president was receiving money from foreign governments through his business, through the Trump Organization. If he is receiving any income that originates with foreign governments, that would be unconstitutional. Two days after receiving that letter from those ethics watchdog groups asking him to look into that possibility, Preet Bharara was told to resign. The day after that, after he refused to resign, he was fired. I mean, these are the reasons people want to see his tax returns. What is his relationship with Deutsche Bank? What is his relationship with foreign sources of income? Is he receiving any money through his business from foreign sources? Is he receiving any money through his business or through any of his real estate deals that can be traced back to foreign governments? I mean, his tax returns should show any income he has received from investment partnerships. This strange-shaped building was a Trump project in Azerbaijan where the Trump Organization partnered with family members of a notoriously corrupt Azerbaijani government official who also has had business ties to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. The president`s tax returns are of interest because if he has received income from foreign sources, as he did in that Azerbaijan deal, the origin of that income may have national security implications. If by any chance it follows those same contours back to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which is a sanctioned organization in this country because of its links to global terrorism. The unanswered questions around Michael Flynn, the fired former national security adviser. He last week retroactively registered as a foreign agent. He declared retroactively that he worked during the campaign and during the transition as a lobbyist for the interests of the government of Turkey. We still do not understand why the Trump administration hired him to be national security adviser after they were advised that he was working for a foreign power. We still do not understand their cageyness around Flynn and his firing. Why, for example, the White House said they fired Flynn because he lied to the vice president but they didn`t fire him until almost three weeks after they learned about those lies? We still have no idea why the vice president says he was completely unaware that Flynn was on the Turkish government payroll. Because he, as head of the transition, was repeatedly notified about it, including by Flynn`s own lawyers, so why would he say now that he had no idea, he`d never heard of it until this past week? What explains the Trump administration`s cageyness around Michael Flynn and specifically around Michael Flynn`s financial ties to Turkey? Well, you know what? It would be helpful to see the tax returns. I mean, what kind of income as Trump Towers Istanbul provided to President Trump through his business? Is any of that income for the president from the Turkish government? Did Turkey have a financial relationship with the president? Do they continue to have a financial relationship with the president? Is there anything about the president`s financial and business entanglements that is potentially driving presidential actions around the issue of Turkey, the unexplained questions and cageyness that is yet to be explained around the issue of Michael Flynn and his firing? There are definitely personality-driven and petty reasons to seek the president`s tax returns. Is he not as rich as he says he is? Is he not as charitable as he says he is? Was he, in fact, under audit when he was using that as an excuse to not release his tax returns? Was that worse than just a bad excuse? Was he really being audited? There`s small reasons to be interested, right? But whether it`s for small reasons or big reasons, there has been an unrelenting demand by people to see his tax returns. More than a million people have signed a White House petition demanding that he release his tax returns. In 19 states, legislation has been now filed that would keep him off the ballot in 2020 unless he releases his tax returns before the reelection campaign. On tax day this year, next month in Chicago, activists are raising money right now to fly a 16-foot inflatable chicken with Trump`s hairdo over their Tax Day protest as a helium balloon. They`re demanding that the president stop being so chicken about releasing his tax returns. Literally today in Missouri, these protesters were outside Senator Roy Blunt`s office demanding that the president release his tax returns. That sign in the front there says, “Is your refund listed in U.S. dollars or in rubles?” There`s a reason that people unrelentingly want to see his tax returns. There`s a reason there are decades of precedent for presidential candidates all releasing them. There is genuine curiosity as to whether they will bear out what he has said about himself in terms of his income. Honestly, there`s genuine concern as to whether he will pursue tax policies that are designed to personally benefit himself and his family – which we won`t know about until we`ve seen his tax returns. There are also concerns just about bookkeeping. There`s reason for concern about whether in his FEC financial disclosure form, which is all we`ve got from him, there`s reason for concern, reasons – there are indications in the paperwork that he may have given wildly inflated valuations of the worth of his golf course properties abroad, when you compare what he said in the FEC document versus tax filings he made on his properties in the U.K. where he declared them all as losing money. Incidentally, lying to the FEC is a crime for which you can go to prison for five years. But with all of that, the concerns about whether he`s going to be self-dealing in his tax policies, concerns about whether he might have lied or misrepresented his own financial circumstance during the campaign, concerns about whether or not he might have misstated things to the FEC – with all of that, there looms over all of this the big national security worry, right? The big almost existential worry, the greatest concern, the worry that this president may be financially beholden to an individual, to an institution, to a country. And now that he`s president, we won`t know if he tries to use the resources and power of our country to pay off that entity to whom he is beholden. We can`t know any of that without getting his tax returns. That`s why presidents release their tax returns. That`s why there will continue to be unrelenting pressure to find Donald Trump`s tax returns, to expose Donald Trump`s tax returns, and that pressure will remain every single day that he remains as president. Unless and until he releases them, the pressure will never let up. And that`s why somebody has decided to leak a portion of his 2005 tax return, which is how and why we got it tonight. And I`m sure it`s only the start but it`s a start and our little piece of it, we just got it. We`ll go through it, next.",1,17543.0,3012.0,host,5.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
5,MADDOW," What I have here is a copy of Donald Trump`s tax returns. We have his federal tax return for one year for 2005. I believe this is the only set of the president`s federal taxes that reporters have ever gotten ahold of. What we have are these two pages, front and back, from the same 1040 form that you might have filled out when you file your taxes. In terms of what`s on here, let me give you the basics. Aside from the numbers being large, these pages are straightforward. He paid $38 million – looks like $38 million in taxes. He took a big write down of $103 million, more on that later. If you add up the lines for income, he made more than $150 million in that year, mazel tov. We got these pages, we got this document today from a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist who`s better on financial matters than almost anybody else in the business. His name is David Cay Johnston. These pages turned up the other day in his mailbox. David will join us live here in just a moment. But because nobody has had the president`s taxes before, we didn`t know what to expect when we showed this 2005 return to the White House to ask them if it`s real. We sent this over to the White House tonight and the White House responded basically with “Yup.” I`m going to read you the White House statement on this tonight. Quote, “Before being elected president, Mr. Trump was one of the most successful businessmen in the world with a responsibility to his company, his family, and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required. That being said, Mr. Trump paid $38 million even after taking into account large-scale depreciation for construction on an income of more than $150 million, as well as paying tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes and this illegally published return proves just that. Despite the substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns. The dishonesty media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the president will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all Americans.” White House statement for tonight. For the record, the First Amendment gives us a right to publish this return. It is not illegally published. Nor are we fake. Pinch me. I`m real. But good on the White House for acknowledging the return as proof of what the president made and paid that year. Here`s the thing, though. A full tax return for someone like Donald Trump would be a lot longer than two pages that we have here. There are all kinds of schedules and notes and attachments that could be involved all containing information about the president and his money. Why will he not release his taxes, his full taxes the way other presidents have done? Why not let the public see the information for themselves? We have obtained this, but this is all we`ve got. This tells us something but he still has disclosed, apparently willingly disclosed nothing compared to all other modern presidents. Joining us is David Cay Johnston. He`s editor and founder of dcreport.org, which has posted this document as of a few moments ago. He`s also the author of “The Making of Donald Trump” and the Pulitzer Prize-winning financial reporter who found the president`s 2005 returns in his mailbox.

8,JOHNSTON," Came in the mail over the transom, and there is absolutely nothing improper about journalists if you haven`t solicited something, getting it over the transom. And, by the way, let me point out, it`s entirely possible that Donald sent this to me. Donald Trump has over the years leaked all sorts of things. The very sleazy girl-on-girl pictures of the first lady in the “New York Post” may have come from Donald. The front pages of the state tax returns that we had that were sent to the “New York Times” and the “New York Daily News” last fall may have come from Donald.

13,MADDOW," Uh-huh. When you look at this document, when you look at these numbers, obviously, we don`t have the supporting schedules and the sort of appendices that you get in big tax returns. Do these numbers seem right to you? Obviously, the White House statement to us is reiterating the $150 million income number and the $38 million paid number. Those numbers seem right to you?",1,373.0,66.0,host,14.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
14,JOHNSTON," Yes. And they fit the things we know from other public records about how Donald does business. For example, the dividends he gets are primarily not what are called qualified dividends that suggest they come from not big companies like ExxonMobil but privately held enterprises. They show almost no tax-exempt interest, about $49,000. That would imply at the time maybe $900,000 of municipal bonds. Not much – I mean, lots of college professors out there my age who have $900,000 in municipal bonds. What`s most important about this tax return, though, Rachel, is that under the regular tax system – when we have two tax systems, well-to-do people, you and I, file – effectively calculate our tax twice, the regular tax system and the alternative minimum tax. If we didn`t have the alternative minimum tax, and Donald Trump in writing wants to end the alternative minimum tax, he would have paid taxes at a lower rate than the bottom half of taxpayers, the poor in this country who make less than $33,000. Now, think about that, $153 million almost of income, he would have paid a little over $5 million, less than 3.5 percent, less than the half of taxpayers who make under $33,000. As it is, because of the alternative minimum tax, he paid $36.5 million, not the $38 million the White House statement says. They`re counting his self-employment tax which is payroll taxes.",1,1373.0,236.0,guest,15.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14

16,JOHNSTON," Thirty-six and a half million, he paid 24 percent. You know who pays 24 percent in this country? Married couples with two incomes like my wife and I who make about $400,000 a year. Donald Trump and his wife that year made $418,000 a day. And the point of this is – the top in this country, people at the top, are not burdened the way we suggest.

19,MADDOW," And those of us who just pay taxes and aren`t experts in them, I want to say back to them and you tell me if I`m getting it right. If there weren`t the alternative minimum tax – you can tell from this 1040, from his two pages from his tax return in 2005, if there weren`t an alternative minimum tax he`d be paying what percent?",1,328.0,66.0,host,20.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
20,JOHNSTON," It`s right on line 44. He would have paid $5.3 million, which is 24 percent of his $152.7 million of positive income. And that`s in large part because he was able to say he had negative income of $103 million.",1,210.0,41.0,guest,21.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14

24,JOHNSTON," He had to pay taxes – he had to pay more in taxes but he still got a benefit. You know why? Because at the top, people are supposed to be paying 35 percent that year, 39.6 percent this year. But if you`re in the alternative minimum tax, you only pay 28 percent.",1,262.0,54.0,guest,25.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14

27,MADDOW," So the issue that – I mean – I tried to lay out at the top of the show reasons why people are so interested in his tax returns. The White House has made this issue and saying it`s only reporters who care, people don`t care, this was litigated in the election when he didn`t release his tax returns and people voted for him anyway. There are a number of reasons to be interested in his tax returns and I think a number of reasons why people continue to be.",1,456.0,91.0,host,28.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14

34,MADDOW, Yes.,1,5.0,2.0,host,35.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
35,JOHNSTON," Yes. And this is a very complicated tangled issue. I mean, here`s a simple question to ask. Every other president has released his tax returns. We have Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton`s tax returns back to the 1970s. Why is it that Donald Trump is so insistent that we`re not to see his tax returns? What – there must be something hiding in his returns. I`ve been at this for 50 years. I started as a teenager doing investigative reporting. And every time some high-level politician wants to hide something, it always turns out there`s a reason. They`ve got something to hide. I have – lots of things we can think of that Donald Trump has to hide, including sources of income and his connections to the Russian oligarchs who are essentially, Rachel, a state-sponsored network of international criminals. And you`ve got to think about them that way and understand that`s their position in the world. And Donald Trump really is desperate that we don`t see where his money comes from. And this is a man who we know was very deeply involved with one of the biggest drug kingpins in America, in the 1980s. He risked his casino license just to show his loyalty to that man. He did business with the biggest mobsters in New York. For years, he traveled with a – the son of the head of the reputed Russian mob boss, himself a twice convicted felon. He says, “I wouldn`t know if he was in the room” – even though they were together all the time traveling. And many other criminals he has associated with them throughout his life. So, it`s particularly relevant for us to say, where did you get the money?",1,1597.0,289.0,guest,36.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
36,MADDOW," David Cay Johnston is the editor and founder of dcreport.org. He`s the one who obtained this Donald Trump tax return 2005. David, can you stay with us for a moment?",1,165.0,31.0,host,37.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
37,JOHNSTON, Sure.,1,6.0,2.0,guest,38.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
38,MADDOW, We`re going to bring Chris hays into the discussion and I want to get back to the issue about the sources of Trump`s money and also the source of this document tonight. We have published this 2005 tax return from the president on MaddowBlog.com. We`ve also linked to David Cay Johnston`s extensive reporting on this on dcreport.org. David is back with us in a moment. Stay with us.,1,382.0,69.0,host,39.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
39,MADDOW, This is Republican Congressman Steve Knight. Mr. Knight has represented California`s 25th district since 2015. Here`s Congressman Knight addressing his constituents at a town hall just over a week ago.,1,202.0,31.0,host,40.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
40,MADDOW," I believe that President Trump should release his tax returns. Crowd goes wild. You can see Congressman Knight`s constituents very happy with that answer. Americans overwhelmingly tell pollsters now that President Trump should release his tax returns. I should mention, though, three days after Congressman Steve Knight said that to his constituents at that town hall in his home district, three days after that, he voted against forcing Donald Trump to release his taxes. Congressman Knight was one of 226 house Republicans who voted in favor of keeping Trump`s taxes under wraps. The only Republican to vote in favor of the public seeing Donald Trump`s tax records is this guy, Walter Jones of North Carolina, he`s the only one, the only Republican for what it`s worth. Congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, he had the courage to vote present in that vote. Courage. Over in the Senate, there have been Democratic attempts to get President Trump`s tax returns released through a vote in the Senate but Republicans have blocked those from even coming up for a vote. Bottom line, though, tonight, we`ve got them – at least we`ve got two pages of them from an anonymous source through David Cay Johnston at dcreport.org. David joins us now along with my friend Chris Hayes, host of “ALL IN”. Thank you both for being here. David, let me ask you, in terms of what you were just describing a moment ago about the most important thing we could learn from President Trump`s tax returns, the sources of his income over the years, obviously you got this 1040 leaked to you, we`ve had a few other individual pages of state tax returns that have been seen, sent to the “New York Times,” you reviewed some of that for your earlier reporting on Donald Trump and taxes from `70s. What would we have to see? What would we hope to get in the mail if we were going to get to the meat of Donald Trump`s potential foreign financial ties?",1,1926.0,337.0,host,41.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
41,JOHNSTON," Well, you want to see the sources of income which will be shown in his business returns. He has over 500 business entities. You want to know who the partners are in those entities and what they show about the income. You also, by the way, want to show the interest he`s paying and the fees he`s paying to other people to know who he`s paying. I mean, we`ve talked about the income he has taking in, but what about people he`s paying?",1,434.0,84.0,guest,42.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
42,MADDOW," Right, and you only pay interest to people to whom you owe money.",1,66.0,14.0,host,43.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
43,JOHNSTON," You owe money, and by the way, one of the biggest places he owes money to? The communist government of China`s Bank of China, which is also the single biggest tenant in Trump Tower. I mean, I grew up in the Cold War. The thought that Republicans would defend the president who has been involved for 30 years with the Russians, not Russia, Russians, who are around Putin and would be borrowing money from Beijing –",1,414.0,77.0,guest,44.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
44,MADDOW," All of which we knew before we got this tax return. Chris Hayes, looking at this and considering the scope of this, what`s your reaction?",1,138.0,26.0,host,45.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
45,HAYES," So, two things come to mind. One is that actually, right, disclosure – there`s an idea like they have something to hide because they`re acting like they have something to hide, right? Their taxes. It`s possible disclosure could benefit them in this way one, right? There was speculation after we got the state taxes in `95 from the “New York Times” that this magnitude of the write-down could have prevented paying taxes for 18 years.",1,435.0,76.0,guest,46.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
46,MADDOW," OK, slow down, explain that for a second.",1,42.0,9.0,host,47.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14

49,HAYES, That`s right.,1,14.0,3.0,guest,50.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
50,JOHNSTON," A loss he shouldn`t have been able to take because it was the loss of the banks. He bought a tax shelter – Republicans in Congress, as soon as they learned about it, they shut down. So, there was double deduction of that and he got the benefit as to the banks of the tax –",1,273.0,57.0,guest,51.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
51,MADDOW," But by taking that $900 million, that set him up to essentially stack that up against income tax he might have to pay anytime for the next 18 years, and it would cancel out any income tax he had to pay.",1,203.0,42.0,host,52.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
52,HAYES," And again, there was speculation he had paid nothing for 18 years. Well, we have this, he paid something –",1,107.0,21.0,guest,53.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
53,JOHNSTON," He encouraged that speculation. When Hillary Clinton said, you know, you`re not paying taxes, he said, “Because I`m smart.” So, which is it? You really did pay a lot of taxes and you`re tricking us, or you`re not paying taxes?",1,227.0,41.0,guest,54.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
54,MADDOW," Now we know, he paid over 20 percent taxes.",1,44.0,10.0,host,55.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
55,JOHNSTON, That`s right.,1,14.0,3.0,guest,56.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
56,HAYES," We should note this is a man who has a fortune. The U.S. has never elected someone from private office and this kind of business dealings, and who would stand to benefit or lose from changes to the tax code that he himself was pushing, for instance, the current plan that is being floated would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which is responsible for him paying a whopping amount of money here.",1,403.0,73.0,guest,57.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
57,HAYES, So that`s another reason for disclosure. And the third thing I keep coming to is they are going to is they are going to – April 15 is coming up. We`re going to file our taxes. Some people are going to file extensions. I presume the White House will file an extension and the reason I think they will is because they cannot use the audit argument with taxes they`re filing now. I can guarantee you one year of Donald Trump`s taxes that are not under audit. They are the one he is would file this year. They cannot be under audit –,1,530.0,104.0,guest,58.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14

59,HAYES," Right. So, that argument gets thinner and thinner and thinner, and he is now reaching the frontier where it no longer is applicable.",1,133.0,24.0,guest,60.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14

63,HAYES, Really?,1,8.0,2.0,guest,64.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
64,JOHNSTON," And if you work at the IRS and call up Rachel Maddow`s tax returns, an inspector will be at your desk like this. You know, we`ve seen the CIA hacked. I`ll be very shocked if we see the IRS hacked. They have better system.",1,222.0,45.0,guest,65.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
65,MADDOW," And with that knowing the security with which these things are treated, Donald Trump has been an adult and filing taxes for a very long time. And, you know, when you file for a mortgage, when you file to apply to different things, you have to show lots of tax returns. Versions of his tax returns have ended up all sorts of places, whether it`s casino license applications, personal applications of any kind, and for some reason, somebody who had access to this one wanted it to be known. I believe this will not be the end of that. Sit right there, we`ll be right back. Again, tonight, we are releasing – we have posted Donald Trump`s 2005 federal tax return. David Cay Johnston of dcreport.org is the man who obtained this. He stays with us as does Chris Hayes. We`re going to be joined by Michael Beschloss in a moment to talk about the historically unprecedented nature of this. Stay with us.",1,897.0,164.0,host,66.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
66,MADDOW," So, we have obtained Donald Trump`s tax returns tonight, his 1040 from the year 2005, the first time his federal tax returns have been made public, have been obtained by any news organization since he is a presidential candidate, let alone since he was president. They were obtained by investigative reporter David Cay Johnston and his reporting shop dcreport.org. These tax returns raise very interesting questions about how much the president`s own proposed tax policies would improve his own personal bottom line. But they raise even more questions about what we haven`t yet seen. Trump is the first president since the Watergate era to refuse to release his taxes of his own accord which makes this release – who knows where it came from – both an interesting news development and potentially a historic one. Joining us now, bringing into the conversation, NBC News presidential historian, Michael Beschloss. Michael, thank you for coming on the show tonight on short notice. We really appreciate you being with us.",1,1020.0,168.0,host,67.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14

68,MADDOW," So, I tried to sum up why the release of presidential tax returns has become such a mainstay of our politics. Why did it start with Nixon? Why has it stayed important since them?",1,179.0,35.0,host,69.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
69,BESCHLOSS," Well, in the time of Watergate, Richard Nixon got into big trouble because it emerged he had backdated the gift of his vice presidential papers and taken a deduction for that, which was illegal. There were a lot of other things happening at Watergate but that was one of them. And the result was people said, “Gee, it must be pretty important that in the future we looked at the president`s tax returns”, and as you`ve said since the time of Jimmy Carter, every single president has released his tax returns every single year and there`s a reason for that. You know, the reason is so that you don`t have a lot of mystery about possible sources and possible conflicts of interest. In Donald Trump`s case, it makes you really wonder whether it`s worth it to him to have not released his tax returns given the kind of mystery we`re seeing culminate tonight and a lot of interest in these tax returns you`ve got.",1,909.0,165.0,guest,70.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
70,MADDOW," Michael, one of the issues that Trump himself has raised when he has been repeatedly and repeatedly and repeatedly asked about his tax returns. Number one, he`s said people don`t care about it, only reporters care about it. That`s not borne out by the polling data and indeed by the persistent activism around this issue. The other issue he`s raised is, yes, yes, it`s been a tradition since Nixon, but it wasn`t before then and I want to go back to what it was like before Nixon.",1,481.0,88.0,host,71.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14

73,BESCHLOSS," Not in modern times. You had something like Warren Harding at the time of the Teapot Dome Scandal, when not the president, but people around him were wheeling and dealing, and some of them got into very big legal trouble over that. But in Donald Trump`s case, you know, we got something unusual, which is – as you and I said many times before, first president who never had military experience or government experience. So, this is someone whose career at least in recent years has been more opaque than it would be if you had someone who was in public service. The other thing that`s really interesting is that we`ve got a House Intelligence Committee investigation, with hearings that are going to be opening extremely soon. So, the timing of this is interesting as well.",1,774.0,137.0,guest,74.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14

78,MADDOW, Did they do along with it? Did they know what Russia was doing and helped them? Was it with their support? And is there any continuing relationship between Donald Trump and the Russian government? That`s one of debt or being beholden or anything like that we need to worry about in terms of our own going national security? Do tax returns become apart of that investigation for that reason?,1,391.0,70.0,host,79.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
79,HAYES," I mean, look, they could be. I mean, the point right now of what we are watching is a sort of political escalation slowly from the people on that committee, particularly Lindsey Graham, right, in the Senate generally, right? The folks in that committee, Richard Burr, who`s in the Senate, and Devin Nunes have been incredibly solicitous of the president`s support and also protective of the president. If the shoe were in the other foot, if this is for Hillary Clinton, they could be – they could be the opposite. And the fact of the matter is, the Congress of United States has tremendous amount of power to compel things from the White House. Now, there are certain things that are protective by presidential privilege. Those are going to be fought over. If those committees wanted to get to the bottom of this, they could have a fight over that.",1,849.0,151.0,guest,80.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14

81,JOHNSTON," Yes, absolutely. And, you know, Richard Nixon said, people have got to know their president is not a crook. In the case of Donald Trump, we have to ask that and we have to know whether he has divided loyalties to a foreign government or governments. But we shouldn`t be doing this in the intelligence committees. There should be a select bipartisan commission with senior investigators not swept under the secrecy rug of the intelligence committees. Do it in the open, tell people what`s there and get everyone of those tax returns going back to the 1970s.",1,557.0,98.0,guest,82.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14

87,MADDOW," Again, tonight, we are breaking news. We have published Donald Trump`s tax returns from 2005. It`s two pages. It`s 1040 form from his federal tax returns that year. Joining us now is NBC News White House correspondent Hallie Jackson. Hallie, it is great to have you with us. I know you are only able to join us by phone. I want to talk with you about the White House reaction to this news tonight and how hard have they fought from stopping something like this from seeing the light of day?",1,491.0,92.0,host,88.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
88,"HALLIE JACKSON, NBC NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (via telephone)"," Well, what I can tell you is this, Rachel, you have these statements I believe earlier on the show from the White House about this, confirming some of the numbers that are in that tax returns. I can speak to what the president and as a candidate have been pressed on repeatedly on the campaign trail again during his transition and then his team has been asked about this as well after the inauguration which is, when will the president release his tax returns? Is that going to happen? You know, there is a line from the president that`s consistently been, as a candidate, that he will not released his return because he`s under audit. You might remember that shortly after the inauguration, Kellyanne Conway seemed to say that the president would not be releasing his returns at all because people didn`t care, and then later on Twitter indicated that in fact, it was because of the audit. The president himself was asked about this. We actually asked him about this of his first press conference after – during the transition. It was in January – about whether he will release it and why wouldn`t he? He said, “Americans don`t care. You talked about the poll numbers about it. We actually asked Sean Spicer about it again last week, the press secretary whether the president is still under audit and will he commit in releasing his 2016 tax returns when those are completed. The press secretary that as far as he knows, the president is still under audit, that nothing has changed. He said he will follow up on the question about whether the president would release the 2016 returns. And I am told by White House officials today that they have not made an announcement on that just yet. So, still questions obviously remaining about this. But the president is a candidate that was not consistent of his reasoning and we have seen no change as yet from the White House, Rachel.",1,1880.0,334.0,guest,89.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-14
89,MADDOW," White House correspondent Hallie Jackson joining us tonight from Washington – Hallie, thank you very much. So, this – this was a little bit of a crazy night. But tonight, thanks to investigative journalist David Cay Johnston, the world is getting its first look at a federal tax return from Donald Trump. Again, this is his two page form 1040 from the year 2005. Incidentally, this is a matter of trivia. This is the year that he got married to his current wife, Melania Knavs, at the time. And she`s listed on here. It is a joint file for the two of them. And you can see some real stuff here. And you can see, for example, that the president reported more than $150 million in income that year. David Cay Johnston got this tax return in his mailbox. He tells us that it came across the transom. The White House tonight confirmed to us that this return is real. They threatened us and told us that it was illegal for us to publish it. It is not illegal for us to publish it, but we`ll take the threat in a spirit with which it was intended. Watch the questions that this revelation tonight brings forward. If somebody was able to release this report, this 1040 report, and get into reporters` hands, I think it is reasonable to expect that there`s more out there and that we will see more of this coming out. You know how much the president made and paid in that one year. We only have two pages. But there is still a long list of questions that could be answered by the president if he wanted to release more or if anybody else does what this source did tonight to get this into our hands. Thanks very much for being with us tonight. That does it for us tonight. We will see you again tomorrow. Now, it`s time for “THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL”.

0,"RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST"," Happy Monday. Thanks for being with us here tonight. There`s a lot going on in the news today and into this evening. The big news that broke in Washington late this afternoon was word from the Congressional Budget Office that the Republican plan to get rid of Obamacare, the Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act would throw 24 million Americans off their health insurance, which is absolutely astonishing. If you`re trying to get your head around 24 million Americans, how many people that is, it is roughly – this is slightly understating the case, but it is roughly the population of all of these states combined. Twenty-four million people is the entire population of Vermont, Alabama, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, Montana, Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire, Idaho, West Virginia, Nebraska, New Mexico, Kansas and Wyoming combined, and then some. That`s the number of Americans who would get thrown off their health insurance if this Republican thing passes to get rid of Obamacare. So, that is obviously big and alarming policy news. It`s big enough that it is also very big political news. We`ll have more about the policy side of it and political side of that coming up tonight. That was the news that sort of struck Washington like a thunderbolt late this afternoon. We`re actually going to start the show tonight on the subject of money, lots and lots and lots and lots of money. Money obtained by means you would rather not have to explain. If you have ill-gotten gains, if you have money where you cannot account for its origin, not if you don`t want to go to jail and it`s not a little money that we`re talking about, it`s billions and billions of dollars, at that scale, at that size, it`s very hard to turn that much illegal or shady money into something that you can use, something you can access without getting arrested, right? If you`re talking about billions of dollars in dirty money, billions of dollars where you cannot explain where it came from, unless you got an industrial-sized scheme from making your shady billions of dollars look legit, you may not be able to use them. Well, just a few weeks ago, at the end of January of this year, we learned about one such industrial-sized scheme to make dirty money look legit. It ran for about four or five years, from 2011 to 2015. It happened at a bank, a big bank called Deutsche Bank. And this scheme that Deutsche Bank got involved with was basically a fantastic, enormous washing machine for illegal Russian money. Deutsche Bank facilitated the laundering of about $10 billion worth of dirty money out of Russia. That`s way bigger than your average money laundering scheme. The way they were able to do it and get away with it before they finally got caught, is that they moved the money through the stock market, right? Stock markets are one of the only places on earth where you can hide a few billion dollars here and there and maybe it just gets lost in the sauce and nobody notices something went wrong with the way that money was moving. Basically, the scheme – again, from 2011 to 2015, it involved real stock in real companies but fake deals. Both the buyer and the seller were in on the deal, or in some cases, it was the same person. And it didn`t really matter what the stock was. It didn`t really matter whether it was economically smart or economically dumb to be buying that particular stock on a particular day. What they were doing with these stock trades was getting rid of their dirty Russian money. I know it sounds gross when I say it that way, but that`s what I mean. They used rubles, ill-gotten gains, right, they couldn`t really explain where they came from. They used rubles to buy stock in Russia and then outside of Russia, they would sell that same stock and get paid in dollars. So, it was a way to turn rubles into dollars. It was all the coordinated thing. It was the same people doing the selling and the buying. It was just a very big, very efficient system for moving, you know, $10 billion, ultimately, in dirty Russian money out of Russia converted into dollars in what looked like a legitimate transaction. At least it looked like a sort of legitimate transaction, Deutsche Bank. Notice what`s going on here? Eventually, Deutsche Bank got nailed and at the end of January, they just got pinned to the wall for this scheme. They let their offices be the vehicle for this illegal fake stock trading scheme. And they had to pay a huge fine. You know, and I never thought that I would have to learn this much about Russian money laundering in order to follow the American presidency. But these are the times we live in and so, we all have to learn new things. I`m an old dog. I`m learning a new trick. But it is kind of amazing when you start following Russian money laundering schemes all around the world. It`s some exotic stuff and it happens all over the world and there is a ton of it. I mean, Russia`s a big country. Russia`s got 140-something million people. But their economy, their GDP is like half of France. They`ve got more – just turn the flag on its side. Russia has more than doubled the population of France. They`ve gotten an economy half the size of France. Why is that? Part of that is because Russia is a kleptocracy. It is governed by thieves. I mean, you keep hearing about Russia oligarchs. You know, sociologically, it`s fascinating to see this brand new class of like oil sheikh level wealth among this tiny group of shady Russian guys with broken noses, right? But it tells you something about what has happened to the economy in that country and why Russia is still limping so badly in economic terms, nearly 30 years after the wall came down. It`s because this corrupt – remember, it was supposed to be two super powers in the world? Think about the economy of the United States and the economy of Russia, right? In Russia, there`s this corrupt, elite class of connected thieves at the top who have been siphoning money out of that country like they are sticking a Shop-Vac into an ant farm. I know we`ve got a billionaire class here and corruption here and we`ve got levels of wealth inequality in this country we haven`t seen since the Gilded Age, I get it. In Russia, it is on a different magnitude. The class, the politically connected class at the top that is stealing is much smaller, is much more connected to the country`s president and is much more traceable now in the short amount of time in terms of the way they have yanked money out of that country and the way they have spread it all over the world to hide it and to disguise its origins. Russian money laundering, you should look into it. It`s interesting. But you know, a funny thing happened about that Deutsche Bank Russian money laundering scheme when it got uncovered. As I said, just a few weeks ago, end of January, Deutsche Bank had to pay $630 million in fines because it got caught in that scheme. But you know what happened on the day that fine was announced? Deutsche Bank got fined $630 million. And their stock price went up. Up. Investors were psyched. Whoo! Only $630 million. Sounds like a big fine, but to those guys it was a relief. Oh. Easily survivable. No problem. Here`s the thing, though – there`s still reason for them to worry about their Russian money laundering problem, because that $630 million fine that they had to pay that was such a relief because it wasn`t too big, that was a settlement that Deutsche Bank reached with New York state. That`s interesting, with the state. International banks have headquarters in New York City. New York state regulates banks that are headquartered in New York through their Department of Financial Services. The Department of Financial Services is who nailed Deutsche Bank for the Russian money laundering thing. Made them pay that $630 million fine. And that`s a good fine, that`s a lot of money and that settled the matter as far as New York state was concerned. But you know what? It`s not over because there`s also the feds. That was the state level settlement. There`s also the fed, the federal government. They`re going after Deutsche Bank on this, too. And when the feds get you, that`s when things can really start to add up. For example, Deutsche Bank got nailed just in December for a totally different thing. Deutsche Bank got nailed in December by the feds for their shady, illegal mortgage practices that led up to the financial collapse in this country. And the fine there, the deal with the feds was not some millions of dollars or even hundreds of millions of dollars. The fine there was a $7 billion fine, billion with a “B.” That was for their mortgage scheme. On that Russian money laundering scheme that Deutsche Bank already got caught for, the state part of it might be settled for $630 million, but the federal case is still opened, still being pursued by the feds. And you know who has been pursing the federal case against Deutsche Bank? Preet Bharara, who was just fired as the federal prosecutor in New York when the Trump Justice Department moved suddenly and without warning to remove all the U.S. attorneys around the country on Friday, including Preet Bharara, even though both President Trump himself and Attorney General Jeff Sessions himself had previously told Preet Bharara he could stay on the job. And we reported on Friday night, you know, that other presidents have replaced other U.S. attorneys or all of the U.S. attorneys before, but nobody has ever fired all the U.S. attorneys the way the Trump folks did on Friday night. Called them in the afternoon on Friday, told all the U.S. attorneys, all without warning that they were all fired immediately. They needed their desks cleaned and they need their keys turned in by midnight, get out. It`s never happened like that before. Why the rush? And why Preet Bharara? Why is he included after you had given him personal assurance that he was staying on? That federal investigation into Russian money laundering by Deutsche Bank, that`s one of many number of open investigations in the Justice Department that has just had a wrench thrown in the works by those sudden firing of the U.S. attorneys on Friday. But looking at the Preet Bharara firing, looking at this shock to the justice system that the Trump administration just levied, Deutsche Bank is a particularly sensitive subject. Deutsche Bank is a particularly sensitive subject of investigation for this president for a couple of reasons. First of all, the former chairman of Deutsche Bank, he left in the middle of all scandal of his bank. He ended up landing very softly, though, at the Bank of Cyprus. Bank of Cyprus is itself a bank that has been in lots of hot water for Russian money laundering accusations. The Deutsche Bank chairman was installed as the chairman of the Bank of Cyprus by the major shareholders of the Bank of Cyprus. Major shareholders of the Bank of Cyprus include this Russian oligarch. They called him the “King of Fertilizer”. He`s now becoming famous in this country for having inexplicably paid Donald Trump $95 million for a single house. It`s the single largest prize paid for a house in the United States. He paid Donald Trump $95 million for that property even though Trump himself had only paid $41 million for it a few years earlier. Why did a Russian oligarch pay Donald Trump $50 million over what Donald Trump paid for that property? We still don`t know. The King of Fertilizer never stepped foot in the property. He`s certainly never lived there. He has since torn it down. But Donald Trump pocketed more than $50 million in that one sale, with that Russian oligarch, who is a major shareholder in the Bank of Cyprus, which has been done and held up on Russian money laundering allegations over the years and now. In terms of the Bank of Cyprus, there is one American who is involved in that bank. The one American who is a major shareholder of the Bank of Cyprus and until recently was its vice chairman is our new commerce secretary, longtime Donald Trump friend, Wilbur Ross. So, the Deutsche Bank chairman landing there with the guy who inexplicably gave Donald Trump $50 million and Donald Trump`s commerce secretary, that makes Deutsche Bank a little bit of a sensitive subject. The other reason Deutsche Bank is a sensitive subject for federal investigations at this point is because the president himself owes more money to Deutsche Bank than any other single lender in the world. President Trump is in hock to Deutsche Bank to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. Deutsche Bank is the largest known lender to Trump`s businesses. So, summarily removing the prosecutor, going after Deutsche Bank, that has personal implications for this president. But that`s not all because it`s not just him. It`s his family. This is the Waldorf Astoria. It`s a big, fancy stately hotel in New York City – emphasis on stately. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations always has a living suite at the Waldorf Astoria. Heads of state from all over the world when they come to New York to do business at the U.N., they stay at the Waldorf Astoria when they`re here. The president of the United States stays at the Waldorf Astoria when he comes to New York for the U.N. or for any other business, or at least that used to be the case. That stopped in 2015 after a Chinese company bought the Waldorf. The company called Anbang. Anbang has murky ownership but nobody can ascertain. There are widespread suspensions that Anbang is a tool of the Chinese government and when Anbang bought the Waldorf Astoria and started rewiring it, U.S. national security agencies deduced that they would no longer be confident that the American president could stay there without being bugged. And so, the U.S. president no longer stays at the Waldorf Astoria, even before we got a U.S. president who has his own place in New York. Anbang started off as a car insurance company in China but they have somehow become a global behemoth and started buying property all over, particularly in the United States. During the Obama administration, some of the Anbang`s purchases were reviewed on national security grounds, again, because this company appears to be a front for the Chinese government and you can`t have foreign governments owning just anything in the United States. For example, this is the Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego, which is lovely. Lovely sport, historic hotel, it`s right on San Diego bay. But look at the Hotel Del Coronado on a map. There`s the Hotel Del Coronado. On one side is Coronado Beach Dog Park, which looks lovely. I was looking at it on satellite view today. Right on the other side of it, our Navy base. It`s right next to a Navy base. And so, when Anbang, this country linked to the Chinese government wanted to buy that hotel, really, right next to the naval base? The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States blocked that purchase on national security grounds. Well, now the Obama administration is gone and the Trump administration is in effect, and now, Anbang, this Chinese company, wants to do a huge new deal. They want to buy a member of the beast, forgive me, 666 5th Avenue. When 666 5th Avenue was sold in 2007 for $1.8 billion, it was the most expensive sale of a single building ever in the United States. Anbang just started shopping around a deal to buy it now for more than a billion dollars over that price from 2007. They`re valuing it at $2.85 billion for a single building. I believe that would make it the most expensive building in North America. That huge inflation in price, over a billion dollars more than the last time it was bought, that would result in a huge payout for the people who bought it back in 2007. If this deal goes through, the people who bought it back in 2007. If this deal goes through, the people who bought it back in 2007 are now going to sell it to this Chinese company, they`re going to make off like bandits. And the people who bought it in 2007 are – hey, remember Jared? The Kushner family, the Kushner real estate empire. And this new offer just unveiled by Anbang, which is believed to be tied to the Chinese government, the Kushners are looking at walking away with $400 million, including some really inexplicable super nice sweeteners to the deal, like a $250 million loan that the Kushners have outstanding on the property from their last re-fi effort. Part of this deal with Anbang would the make Kushers, they`ve got $250 million, they only have to pay back $50 million of it. It`s an 80 percent off sale. Everything must go. This would be a massive purchase, though, way bigger than the Hotel Del Coronado. But like the Hotel Del Coronado or any other major purchase by a company like this, this would have to be approved by a Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States isn`t an obscure committee. Its members are basically the whole cabinet. Secretary of defense, secretary of treasury, secretary of homeland security, secretary of commerce, et cetera. Yes. Sorry, actually. This would be the old committee on foreign investment in the United States. That`s who was on it during the Obama administration. Now, it`s the Trump administration in effect. So, now, this is the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States that will be evaluating whether or not Jared`s family gets $400 million. Hey, look, it`s Wilbur Ross from the Bank of Cyprus with the guy who paid Donald Trump $50 million extra for the – Two days before the Trump administration decided to surprise, fire, all of the U.S. attorneys with no notice, get your things and clean out your desk by midnight, turn in your keys, two days before that, on Wednesday of last week, a group of watchdog organizations wrote to Preet Bharara as the U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York, and they asked him based on his jurisdiction to please look into whether or not the president was illegally receiving payments from foreign governments through his continuing ownership stake in the Trump Organization. John Conyers, top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, he`s now written to the Justice Department to ask for a list of all pending Justice Department investigations that involve members of the Trump administration, members of the Trump transition, members of the Trump campaign or the Trump Organization. He says he wants that list of investigation so we can understand the full implications of this weekend`s firings of the federal prosecutors. Were any of those prosecutors fired because of the ongoing investigations into the Trump campaign, or the Trump Organization, or the Trump administration? We don`t know why the Trump administration decided to fire all the U.S. attorneys in the way they did on Friday, with no warning, with apparently no preparation, with no replacements lined up to nominate for those positions. We particularly don`t know why the president did a 180, did an about-face and decided to throw out the U.S. attorney who has jurisdiction over things like, hmm, Russian money laundering and the Trump business empire. But just one last point to chew on here. The Trump administration demanded, surprise, demanded the resignation of all U.S. attorneys on Friday afternoon. Preet Bharara didn`t do it. They asked for the resignations from all of the U.S. attorneys, Preet Bharara did not do it. He knew at the time, we all knew, that the president had the power to remove him and that by standing up and saying, “I`m not going to resign, you`re going to have to fire me,” ultimately, the president would fire him. He knew that`s how it would work out. But because Preet Bharara didn`t resign, because he took that stand and did not submit his resignation when he was asked for on Friday, because he said, you`re going to have to fire me and then they had to go through the process of firing him, I mean, there was no suspense as to what the outcome was going to be. There`s no suspense as to whether or not he`d be allowed to keep his job, he knew he would have to go. But because of the way he did it, because he didn`t resign, because he made them fire him, he delayed the process. He didn`t get fired. He didn`t get removed from office until Saturday afternoon. By insisting he would not resign and they`d have to fire him, Preet Bharara bought himself, as best as I can tell, about 24 hours and 29 minutes, 24.5 extra hours in office once he knew they were coming for him. So, as you think about what pending investigations might have been rooted through that office in New York, Trump campaign, Trump transition, Trump administration, Trump organization, oh, and all of the banks in the world, what do you think Preet Bharara did with that last 24 hours once he knew they were coming for him? Stay with us.",1,20851.0,3668.0,host,1.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-13
1,MADDOW," If he wasn`t the most famous U.S. attorney in the country before, he certainly is now. That`s Preet Bharara, a U.S. attorney from the southern district of New York. Look at the scene today. This is him outside his office. These are all of the people who work in the U.S. attorney`s office of the southern district of New York, them giving him a long-standing ovation out in the cold today as he leaves office. He was asked for his resignation along with all of the other federal prosecutors on Friday. He did not offer his resignation. On Saturday, he tweeted, “I did not resign. Moments ago, I was fired.” By waiting, by saying “No, he wouldn`t resign,” it`s one of the curious things about the Preet Bharara`s tenure at the U.S. attorney`s office is that he now leaves office having had this interesting interregnum, about 24 1/2 hours after he knew they were going to fire him but before he actually left office. Thinking about what he might have done with that time, with that little bit of time that he earned himself by not quitting is one of the ongoing mysteries about what the Justice Department just did here.

7,MADDOW," Michael, one of the things that we`re seeing in terms of what`s happening in Washington right now and I think there`s a renewed focus on Preet Bharara and some of the other U.S. attorneys in terms of they might have been pursing Justice Department investigations into some of the scandals of this administration, potential ties with Russia, we are starting to see Democrats raising the prospect that they might peel off from these congressional investigations, congressional intelligence committees, both in the House and the Senate are supposed to be leading these congressional investigations. This weekend, Democrats started to say, we`re not sure that those are going to be free and fair and independent investigations. Maybe we shouldn`t be part of them. Is that kind of negotiation, that kind of worry on the part of one party or another, that is the sort of thing that has precedent in previous years?",1,909.0,151.0,host,8.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-13
8,BESCHLOSS," It is. And we would think of Devin Nunes and the house committee investigating the ties between Donald Trump and Russia, plus, the Russian attack on our election last year and interfering with democracy. And Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat, saying, we might not stay involved with this, you know, if the chairman does not pursue a vigorous investigation. And, you know, the classic of investigations that really work would be the Senate Watergate committee, 1973. Senate said by 77-0, let`s have this committee. There was great cooperation. Howard Baker, the Republican vice chairman was very much of a straight shooter. He was trying to pursue truth. Same was true with the joint committee that investigated Iran-Contra in 1987. Those are examples of investigations where the committee saw great harmony between the two parties, and most of all, the chairman and ranking member, they had not said at the beginning we think the president is innocent or guilt. The problem – the difference here is with Chairman Nunes, as we know, he has said he doesn`t think there`s much to the ties between Donald Trump and Russia. He was a member of the Trump transition team. He has said that Michael Flynn was a victim and was doing great things for his country. He rejected the intelligence report in January saying that the Russians did try to help Donald Trump, so there`s no a sign that there`s that same kind of a partisanship that you saw in those earlier hearings.",1,1462.0,251.0,guest,9.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-13

Since then, the spotlight on him has been intense in his own district. Starting in January, constituents of his have been holding weekly protests outside his California offices. Among other things, they`ve been demanding that he hold a town hall so they can converse with him. They have visited and left letters outside his office.

19,MADDOW," Today, the Congressional Budget Office announced that the Republican plan to kill Obamacare will cause 24 million Americans to lose their health insurance. That`s 24 million people who have insurance now losing their insurance. That`s part of why the Republican plan to kill Obamacare is not likely to survive. Another reason why it`s not likely to survive is what members of Congress are facing in their home districts. The only Republican senator who is going to be running for re-election next year from a state that Hillary Clinton won is Nevada Senator Dean Heller. And his constituents have found their voice this year. They`ve been asking him for a town hall, among other things. Last month, they bought tickets to a private event in order to see him because he wouldn`t do a public event with them. But at that private event, the senator made them a promise. He said he would hold a town hall if everybody going to the town hall agreed that they wouldn`t boo him. No deal. Senator Heller has yet to hold a public in the flesh town hall. He did hold a private event with constituents this weekend. According to leaked audio of that event, Dean Heller told the crowd, quote, “Not everything in the Affordable Care Act is bad. As we move forward and look at what some of these changes and what`s occurring, I think we ought to embrace what`s good in the Affordable Care Act.” He also said, quote, “Do I believe all Americans should have access to health care? Absolutely, I do.” That was on Saturday. Again, today, the CBO projected that 24 million Americans would eventually lose their health insurance under the new Republican plan to get rid of Obamacare. But you know what? The first 14 million of those 24 million, the first 14 million would lose coverage by 2018. Just in time for the midterm elections, when Dean Heller and Darrell Issa will both be up for re-election in what are likely to be the fights of their lives. You can believe it`s on their calendars already.",1,1982.0,351.0,host,20.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-13

Senator Hanson`s party was projected to get a healthy 13 percent of the vote. They did not get 13 percent. Her right-wing anti-immigrant party actually got less than 5 percent of the vote. They bottomed out. Rough weekend for the Trump loving nationalist party in Australia. No champagne toasts this time. We`re still just figuring out how our new president ate the Republican Party, and became president in this country.

28,MADDOW," That`s Geert Wilders, speaking last year at the Republican convention in this country. He`s anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim. I don`t say that in an ad hominem way. He`s literally been founded guilty of inciting hatred against Muslims in the Netherlands. But he`s giving the incumbent Dutch prime minister a run for his money. The polls are close. It`s unclear exactly how it`s going to go on Wednesday and some people in the Netherlands, I think it`s fair to say, are rather freaked out about what might happen in their elections in two days. They`ve been watching us tangle knee-deep in dealing with Russian interference in our election wondering how that may have tipped the scales one way or another in our experience. Well, the Dutch are trying to ensure that there are no similar shenanigans in their election. They decided to forego the use of electronic vote counting for this election this week. They`re using paper ballots. Quote, “Voters will use red pencils to mark paper ballots, which will be hand counted in each voting precincts, and then tallied across the nations 20 voting districts.” That`s how the 17 million citizens of the Netherlands will be voting this Wednesday. Amid worries about Russian interference in their election with this very provocative right-wing anti-immigrant candidate standing, they are taking extra precautions to ensure the integrity of their elections.

45,MADDOW," We`ve reported in recent days about some of the unexplained, unanswered questions concerning the firing of National Security Adviser Mike Flynn after only 24 days on the job. We`ve also been reporting a little bit on what`s happened to him since he was fired. Since he was fired, last week, General Flynn was apparently persuaded to retroactively file papers to declare himself a foreign agent. He was a paid lobbyist, lobbying for the interests of the government of Turkey while he was also helping to elect Donald Trump and serving in the Trump transition, also, incidentally, while he was sitting in on ton secret national security briefings. But it turns out to be super important that he has filed those papers now. The filings specifically end up being important, because we`re now learning something from his “I am a foreign agent” papers that have finally made a very mysterious episode from the campaign last year all of a sudden make sense. Oh, that`s why that happened. What we`re learning, what it means, and more still unexplained questions about Michael Flynn next.",1,1080.0,182.0,host,46.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-13
46,MADDOW," If you need a nominee for the sexiest word in politics you could do worse than “cover-up.” And three weeks out from the election, conservative media found one.

The under secretary of state for management discussed providing additional overseas slots for the FBI in exchange for revisions to classifications of the sensitive e-mails.” And then comes the runner-up sexiest words in politics. Quote, “The FBI records official says that his colleague pressured him to declassify an e-mail, quote, `in exchange for a quid pro quo.`” You`re not using that phrase right. But, you know, coverup! The Clinton State Department trying to cover up something about her e-mails in a quid pro quo. Cue the avalanche.",1,1022.0,162.0,host,47.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-13

52,MADDOW," FOX News and conservative media took that coverup, quid pro quo, flashing light of criminality, redacted, redacted, redacted. They took that story, they grabbed that mystery bait and went straight for the bottom of the pond. They played it three days straight. Coverup, quid pro quo! A top staffer at the Clinton State Department accused of trying to trade the FBI something they wanted if they helped disappear a Clinton e-mail message. 2016, heading into the election, FOX News stayed on that story long enough that real news started to follow it up. When that happened, it started to get walked back. First off, the redacted, redacted, redacted, now former FBI official, who wasn`t named in those reports, he came forward and he said that he was the one who suggested any kind of deal. Quote, “I`m the one who threw that out there,” he told the “New York Times.” And second, it was no big deal, this former FBI agent disputed he had ever characterized his conversations with the State Department official as a quid pro quo. Quote, “That`s a reach, I said hey, what`s this about, listen, there was no collusion, there was absolutely no collusion”, he said. “No story, nothing to see here, no collusion, that`s a reach.” But the damage was done. Three straight days of quid pro quo, flashing red light of criminality, coverup. Damage was done, well done. And apparently, now, we know it was well paid, because now we have a new revelation about this story. Last week, the former national security adviser to the president filed some new federal paperwork, Mike Flynn registered retroactively as a foreign agent, finally admitting that he took paid work as a lobbyist for the interests of the Turkish government during the presidential campaign where when he was advising Donald Trump. General Flynn was, of course, pushed out of the White House for his contacts during the transition for the Russian government and for lying about them. But his work involving Turkey is proving to be its own clingy scandal. Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo has looked into General Flynn`s new foreign agent filing and look what he found, the former FBI official at the heart of that quid pro quo story? The one who walked it back after it had spent three days on constant rotation at FOX News and the conservative media? That former FBI official apparently was on Mike Flynn`s payroll during the campaign. He`s started getting paid by Flynn about two weeks before that scandal. He got $5,000 from General Flynn on October 4th, he got $3,000 from Flynn on October 13th. That so happens to be two days before the coverup quid pro quo story broke. Then he got another $20,000 from General Flynn down the line. When he did walk back the story, he said he considers General Flynn a friend. I`m sure that was so, quite sure. But it helps to know now his friend the general was also his boss. He was on the general`s payroll. Just as it helps to know his boss was a foreign agent – when he was breaking that story all about Hillary Clinton`s e-mails. It does make you wonder what else there is to learn about that particular side of the story. Watch this space. That does it for us tonight. We will see you again tomorrow. Now, it`s time for “THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL”. Good evening, Lawrence.",1,3289.0,579.0,host,53.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-13

2,MADDOW," And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. We`ve got a big show tonight. I`m glad you`re here for it. I want to tell you in terms of the way the show is going to go. We`ve only got one guest booked for this evening. We feel very lucky to have him. He`s the longest-standing senior member of the U.S. Foreign Service. He served under President Obama and under President George W. Bush before that and under President Clinton before that and under President George H.W. Bush before that and under Reagan before that and under Carter before that. He has been there a long time. He is a pillar of the U.S. State Department. He`s part of its institutional memory. He has been in the room for basically every important negotiation, every standoff, every big development, particularly between the United States and Russia for decades. And we`ve got him here tonight because he`s out now. He`s gone. The Trump folks chose not to keep him on. He was actually – I said he was the most senior diplomat in the Foreign Service – he was actually the third-most senior diplomat in the foreign service until a few weeks ago. Then the Trump administration got rid of the number one and number two most senior people ahead of him in the foreign service, so that did make him the most senior person still standing – but now he`s out, too. I mean, think about that for a second. After he was initially hired into the Foreign Service in 1977, five subsequent presidents of both parties thought it would be a good idea to keep him on, right? That his deep understanding, his knowledge of all the players and so many of the secrets it would make him an indispensable asset, particularly when it comes to dealing with Russia. Which makes sense, right? I mean, you want to avoid getting rolled. You want to avoid getting outmaneuvered or tricked. Particularly when we are a country where leaders turn over every few years and – I mean, in Russia, Vladimir Putin has been in charge for 17 years and counting, right? That`s a disadvantage for us in terms of knowing the players, having a long-term plan, right? It makes sense in that environment that you would hold on in the U.S. government to the people who know their way around this particular block, right? That`s how you end up with a guy like him, you know, the most senior diplomat America has. That`s how you end up with a guy like Dan Fried, overseeing the U.S. sanctions against Russia for Russia did in Ukraine and Crimea. Russia hates those sanctions more than they love life. They hate those sanctions. So, of course, you need your toughest and most experienced guy running those sanctions. Or you did. Like I said, he`s gone from the State Department now. Like every other person who had as much seniority as him at the State Department, all gone. He`s going to be here on set tonight, in his personal capacity as a former ambassador. We are very, very lucky to have him. The new administration may not want the benefit of his expertise in terms of figuring out what Russia is up to with us right now but I do. I mean, we can all benefit from it as a country as we figure out what`s going on right now with this presidency and with Russia in particular. Russia and Putin`s antipathy toward Hillary Clinton from her time as secretary of state, Russia`s antipathy and loathing and fear of the U.S. State Department in general, those two – those things that we know about Russia they put a worrying cast over how successfully the new administration here has hollowed out and emptied out the U.S. State Department in just the few weeks since then been in charge. Given how we know Russia feels about the State Department, seeing what`s happening to the State Department under this current administration is worrying and raises all sorts of questions about the connections between this current administration and Russia. So, we are going to hear from former Ambassador Dan Fried in person in just a few minutes tonight. He is our solo guest. We led last night – we led last night`s show with news about the Russia connections to the new administration and what we are continuing to learn about those connections. What`s getting to be, I think, particularly unsettling is that simultaneously we are right now what`s going on, I think, is that we are number one nailing down more direct connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government at the time the Russian government was influencing our election. And number two, at the same time, we are starting to see what may be signs of continuing influence in our country. Not just during the campaign but during the administration, basically signs of what could be a continuing operation. And those two things together are worth paying attention to. So, tonight, let`s start with the first one. Let`s start with evidence that we`re getting and evidence that we`ve got of direct Russian government connections with the Trump campaign, during the campaign, while the Russian government was interfering in our election to try to elect Trump. For months, the Trump campaign denied full stop that anybody associated with their campaign had any ties with Russia or any contacts with Russia full stop. One of the revelations of the last few days is that a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, one of five people he named as his foreign policy advisers during the campaign not only traveled to Moscow last summer, in July, we now know that he got authorization from the Trump campaign at the time to take that trip to Moscow. That trip was in July of last year, it was just before the Republican convention. A week later, Trump officials at the Republican convention pushed the Republican Party platform on one issue and one issue only – they wanted language about Russia significantly softened in the Republican Party platform. There had been a proposed plank for the platform that said the Republican Party believed the United States should support Ukraine in any way that we could up to and including providing them weapons, so they could fight off Russian incursions into Ukraine. That was the proposed plank in the Republican Party platform. The Trump folks didn`t care about anything else. They fought for nothing else in the platform but they fought that. They fought to change that to a softer more pro-Russian stance. And this is worrying in part because this is what was described in that British dossier, right, of alleged Russian dirt on Donald Trump. This dynamic was described as what Russian wanted as a quid pro quo for its intervention on Trump`s behalf in the presidential election. I mean, part of what the dossier says is this, quote, “The operation”, meaning the effort to influence our election, “that has been conducted with the full knowledge and support of Trump and senior members of his campaign team. In return, in return, the Trump team has agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue.” So, that is from that dossier of alleged Russian dirt on Donald Trump, right? This dossier is still considered to be mostly uncorroborated but it`s overall allegation is that the Trump folks knew, the Trump folks knew about the Russian campaign to interfere in our election, they supported it, they cooperated with it, and in exchange, they made promises to the Russians. They promised specifically to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue. Well, we don`t have evidence, we don`t have corroborating evidence of the first part of that, that the Trump folks were in on it, they were cooperating, they were corroborating, that they were colluding with this. We don`t have evidence of that part of it. But we definitely do have evidence of the second part of it. We do have evidence the Trump campaign was working to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue. We have belated evidence of that, but we`ve now got it. After Mr. Trump and his campaign manager both initially denied having anything to do with the platform change, a Trump campaign official now admits that the campaign pushed to soften the Russian language in the platform. It says it was done specifically at Trump`s request. The other piece of it we learned last night in “Politico” is that a Russian citizen who worked for the Trump campaign manager in Ukraine, worked for Paul Manafort when Manafort was working in Ukraine, that Russian citizen visited the United States around the time of the Republican convention. He later claimed to have been responsible for getting the Trump campaign to get the Russia language softened in the Republican Party platform. “Politico” reports that this Russian citizen, Konstantin Kilimnik, “Politico” reports that he`s now under scrutiny by U.S. authority, including the FBI. So, again, there`s two things we`re tracking here, right? The first one is direct links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign while the Russian attack on our election was under way. And to that point, there is a second beat on this story that you need to know, in terms of this softening the Russian language and the Republican platform. There`s a second beat on this you should know. Back in August, there was some additional reporting on this particular Russian guy who used to work with Paul Manafort, used to work with Trump`s campaign manager in Ukraine. We now know he traveled to the U.S. ahead of the Republican convention. He may have been involved. He says he was involved in making the Republican Party`s platform more pro-Russia. Well, that guy, that Russian guy back in August when there was a lot of attention to Paul Manafort, to Trump having a campaign manager with tons of Russian ties and lots of experience working in that part of the world. At that time, in August of last year, “Politico” profiled this Russian guy who was Paul Manafort`s right hand man in his previous work in Ukraine. And one of the things they turned up about this Russian guy is that he very proudly admitted that he was Russian intelligence. He at one point had a job working at the International Republican Institute, their office in Moscow. When he applied for the job, he apparently told the IRI that he learned his language skills, that he built up his resume in the GRU, which is Russian military intelligence. Quoting from “Politico”, one of their sources, “It was like, oh, yeah, Kostya, the guy from the GRU.” That`s how we talked about him. Quote, “The institute was informed that he was GRU, but it didn`t matter because they weren`t doing anything sensitive.” They knew he was Russian military intelligence but that was OK, it was a Moscow office. They weren`t doing anything sensitive so it`s okay he was Russian military intelligence. But then he turns up in a U.S. presidential campaign at the Republican National Convention changing the Republican Party`s platform on Russia to make it more pro-Putin and he`s a GRU guy? He`s a Russian military intelligence guy? So, this is what we`ve been piecing together in recent days as more and more parts of this story get corroborated, more connections between not just Trump and people with Russian connections, but connections between the Trump campaign and the actual Russian government and Russian intelligence during the time that the Russian government and Russian intelligence were mounting an operation against us, against our election to try to affect the outcome. And the worry, right, is that that`s not a coincidence. If there were multiple contacts not just with random Russians but Russians connected to that government, and if those connections weren`t happening at a random time, they were happening while Russia was mounting a U.S. operation against the U.S., and it wasn`t happening behind a veil of ignorance, we had no idea. It was happening while there were public news reports about the Russians trying to interfere in our election, then what were they talking about? Why were those contacts between the Trump campaign and all these Russians? What were those contacts about? Why did Trump advisers need to go to Russia then? Why did the Russian ambassador need to meet with Jeff Sessions then? Why did the Russian intelligence guy have to go to Cleveland then? And if the reason for all of those things is the worst-case scenario, right, if it`s – you know, that the Trump folks whether or not blind to what the Russian government was doing, they are in on the Russian government`s scheme. Well, if the worst-case scenario is true – and we are building day by day a new piece of that everyday, well, that brings us to the second concern, that the Russians didn`t choose to effect our election, they didn`t interfere with our election, they didn`t mount this huge op against our election for kicks. They weren`t doing it for fun and they weren`t doing it for free. They expected payback, they expected a return on their investment. And if so, who here thinks they`d be satisfied with a weakening of the Ukraine plank in the Republican Party platform as their payment, right? That`s not the sort of payback they`d be satisfied with, right? And that`s part of why we`ve been putting a spotlight on the drastic cuts and hollowing out of the U.S. State Department under President Trump. When Vladimir Putin runs up against American power and American criticism and American leadership that reminds him of what Russia isn`t, when he runs up against people who he worries are funding his dissidents or supporting protests against him, when he runs up against criticism of the way he runs his own country, what he`s running up against is the State Department, right? Silencing the U.S. State Department, putting a friend of Vladimir Putin`s in charge at the U.S. State Department, who stands by quietly while the State Department gets hollowed out, gets gutted, that`s a dream for the Russian government, right? That`s a dream for Putin. But there`s one last point here to keep in mind and it is about the other part of the U.S. government besides the State Department that I think Putin and Russia probably most fantasize about hurting. Go back for a second to that Republican convention last summer. Remember, that platform fight over softening the Russia language and the Ukraine plank. That happened about a week after one of Trump`s foreign policy advisers took that campaign-authorized trip to Moscow. Well, about a week after that platform fight, the day after the Republican convention ended, there was another political bomb that was dropped on the U.S. presidential election from Russia. The day after the Republican convention ended, right before the Democratic Convention began we got what U.S. intelligence agencies believed to be the next big Russian incursion into our election. We got the first WikiLeaks dump. We got the first WikiLeaks publication of documents hacked and stolen by Russian government sources from the DNC, from the Democratic Party, and they started publishing those stolen documents from the DNC right before the Democrats started their convention. That`s how the Democrats got to start their nominating convention, with the chair of the party resigning and the party and campaign being blindsided by selectively curated and selectively released documents designed to make the Democratic Party look as terrible as possible. Good timing, right? Good political timing if you`re trying to help Trump and hurt the Democrats. What was particularly impressive by the Trump campaign at the time is how they were so organized around the WikiLeaks stuff. They were able to jump right on those WikiLeaks releases and instantly dovetail their own message with the curated point of the WikiLeaks dump which was to highlight and deepen and aggravate the rift between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders wings of the Democratic Party. The Trump campaign turned on a dime instantly as soon as those WikiLeaks dumps started. That was their new message. They were right on it. And by the end of that month, by the end of August, what was weird on the Trump side, was that people close to Trump were apparently in the know on what was going to come next from WikiLeaks, on what the next batch of Russian hacks documents was going to be. This is from an informal campaign adviser of Donald Trump. A long time associate of Donald Trump. See the date on that, August 21st? Eerily uncannily in the know, “Trust me, it will soon be Podesta`s time.” Eerily in the know that John Podesta would be next somehow, trust me. Well, then, a few weeks later, October 7th, indeed, WikiLeaks released its whole new dump. A whole new bunch of e-mails and documents, this time from Clinton campaign chief John Podesta, e-mails that U.S. intelligence say were hacked by Russia. Apparently, again, they were waiting for the best possible timing on the release. The John Podesta WikiLeaks dump came just about one hour after the “Access Hollywood” tape was published. The “I like to grab them by the p-word” tape, one hour after that came out is when WikiLeaks dropped the first tranche of John Podesta e-mails hacked by the Russians. And then they went on to release more and more and more of the John Podesta e-mails almost everyday until the election. And the Democratic Party likes to remind people that the Russian force around that was very strong, remarkably strong. Like that day in October when Russian state television was magically able to tweet about the next release of John Podesta e-mails. The sixth release of John Podesta e-mails even before WikiLeaks released them. What? Look at the time stamps on these two tweets. There`s Russia Today on the left tweeting “The new e-mails, the sixth batch of Podesta e-mails is out”. They`re tweeting at 8:09 a.m., and then at, oh, look, 8:38 a.m., the documents are actually out that really is breaking news. You broke the news the stuff had been released even before it was released. How did you know it was coming? Russia Today, how did you know it was coming? WikiLeaks is a lot of things. This past year, WikiLeaks was a tool of Russian intelligence and the Russian government and their interference operation against the American presidential election to benefit Donald Trump. There is also evidence that the people close – that people close to the Trump campaign had advanced notice of WikiLeaks actions and may have had direct contact with WikiLeaks itself while they were releasing those documents from the Democratic Party, from the Clinton campaign. And here`s where it comes home, because if you are worried about whether Russia is getting paid back now, if you are worried that Russia may be reaping its reward, maybe getting what it wants out of the United States government as payback for running the successful op that helped install the new head of the American government, that helped install this new American president – well, I mean, if you look, for example, at the State Department and worry that Putin loves to see the state department wither on the vine while the new secretary of state doesn`t peep about it at all, well, consider what the other U.S. agency is besides the State Department that Putin most hates? That Putin most feels competitive with? That Putin most wants to beat? It`s the CIA, right? Spy versus spy. Putin is ex-KGB. He`s an ex-FSB officer. This week, WikiLeaks released what`s being described as a devastating dump of CIA cyber war tools. WikiLeaks described it as the entire cyber arsenal of the CIA. The CIA itself won`t put that fine a point on it, but smart observers say this is the largest dump of classified CIA material maybe ever, and it really could be a devastating blow to the CIA`s cyber war and flat-out spying capabilities, and that dump was released by WikiLeaks the day before yesterday, on Tuesday. Today, at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has lived for almost five years hiding from rape charges in his native Sweden, today a man named Nigel Farage, not the guy in the foreground there, but the guy in the background, he was seen leaving the Ecuadorian embassy where Julian Assange lives. He later told BuzzFeed when they asked him what he`d been doing there that he couldn`t remember why he was at the building today. He just left the building. He couldn`t remember why he was there. Nigel Farage, even if you don`t follow British politics, he`s a British politician but you may recognize him from his frequent visits to the United States, for example, his time at Trump Tower. You may recognize him from his time on the campaign trail with Donald Trump. Nigel Farage, you may also recognize from the recent sighting we had of him eating dinner with Donald Trump at his D.C. hotel and restaurant two weeks ago. Well, that Nigel Farage was at WikiLeaks headquarters today in London right before WikiLeaks gave their big press conferences about destroying the cyber capabilities of the CIA. Russian government attacked our election. Russian government was in contact with multiple Trump campaign sources while they were doing it. Russian nemesis in the American government, U.S. State Department, CIA, are not faring well since Donald Trump came to power. Is the operation that Russia started during the campaign, is it over? Or are they still running it? Are we still in this now? Stay with us.",1,21298.0,3650.0,host,3.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-09

8,MADDOW," Here`s a thing you should know about Senator Tom Cotton. He`s seen as a real rising star in the Republican Party. He`s the youngest member of the United States Senate, routinely described as an up and comer. He`s known for his efforts to scale back legal immigration. Legal. He wants to stop legal immigrants from coming to this country. That`s very popular in Republican politics right now. And, of course, he has been an absolute champion of the idea of getting rid of Obamacare, scrapping the Affordable Care Act. But, you know, his constituent this is year have had some things to say about these matters to Senator Cotton. In January, his offices stopped answering their phones and, as we saw here, stopped letting anyone inside their offices. They also started cancelling meets with constituent groups. And the senator got a ton of blowback. He became the star of fake missing person`s signs, encouraging folks to call if they saw him and also to call him and ask why he had been missing while his constituents were looking for him. Members of the local Ozark Indivisible group started showing up regularly in droves outside his local offices. One organizer told “The Arkansas Times”, quote, “If they don`t hear us face to face, maybe they`ll hear us outside.” The pressure finally became a big enough deal at home in Arkansas that Senator Cotton said OK, OK, OK. He called the head of Ozark Indivisible, called her on her cell phone and said he would hold a town hall event within the coming weeks. And the logistical drama around that was a real thing. It was never quite clear if the event would really happen. His office kept changing the location and not just once or twice but a bunch of times. In fact, because the logistics and venue moved so many times, a lot of people who wanted to go to the town hall worried that folks ultimately wouldn`t know where it was or when it was and nobody would show up. But it turns out, you know what? People found it, everybody got there just fine. And when it came time for people to tell the senator what they had on their minds and ask him their questions, turns out there was kind of a theme.",1,2146.0,387.0,host,9.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-03-09

18,MADDOW," So, that was last month, during the congressional recess. Tom Cotton at home in Arkansas. Since then, the Senate has come back into session. Senator Cotton and his fellow lawmakers are back in D.C. and Republicans are split, they are divided about what to do with the repeal to feel Affordable Care Act. That`s topic that Senator Cotton was really berated for at that town hall event that almost did not happen. Last night, two committees in the house were up all night long trying to get a version of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act passed. House Republicans are just fighting tooth and nail to pass it in the House, to try to get it into the Senate, to try to make it then so that the Senate will get on board. But you know who one of the Republican senators is who`s not on board with this anymore? Senator Tom Cotton. He started the day by tweeting this. “To my friends in the House, start over. Pause. Start over. Get it right. Don`t get it fast.” Senator Cotton has campaigned on wanting to kill Obamacare. He voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act back in January, but he now says, despite these marathon all-night sessions going on in the House, Republicans need to do better, they need to start over, they need to come up with something that the Senate says will actually reduce prices for insurance and keep it affordable. And who knows what exactly changed Tom Cotton`s mind on this. I mean, maybe it was that woman who said her husband was dying and only alive thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Maybe it was the young woman on your right side of your screen who said that without the treatment she could only receive through the Affordable Care Act she herself would be dead. Maybe it was them. Maybe it was not one moment in particular but as a general matter, there`s a reason people turn up to try to pressure their member of Congress. There`s a reason people pause their lives to engage in political activism and pressure their local political leaders. Because as a whole, even if you can`t identify any one instance, as a whole pressure works and sometimes it starts with something as simple as pushing the button on the intercom.

19,MADDOW," So the foreign minister of Mexico is this man. He was in Washington, D.C. today. According to an official press release from his office, he held meetings today with three top people in the White House, with the economic adviser Gary Cohn, the former president of Goldman Sachs, with the national security adviser, General H.R. McMaster, and with Jared, with the president`s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. Nowhere to be found with on that list, the Mexican foreign minister`s official counterpart in our government, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. So, this is a perfect example as to why the newly reinstated State Department press briefings are a useful thing. We haven`t had them for weeks now, but they`ve just come back. We didn`t have one in person today, we just had one by phone and on the phone one today, reporters made a point of asking, hey, what gives about this visit?

23,MADDOW," They had no idea. Really? What was it? “I was unaware the foreign minister was in town.” The foreign minister of our neighbor and close ally is in Washington? Today? You know, we`re a little short staff, haven`t been picking up our messages, we suspended the in-house newsletter, the mimeo is broken, also bulletin board is being cleaned. I had no idea. Hello, anybody home? Is anybody home? Since his arrival, the new secretary of state has not held a single press conference. On his first big trip to Europe last month for the G20 summit, Rex Tillerson said less than 50 words in total in response to press questions, and while his silence and refusal to answer reporters` questions is one thing, the hallowing out of the State Department, the erasure of institutional memory in that agency on his brief watch, that`s something else entirely. Right after Secretary Tillerson was sworn in, four of the top career diplomats at the department were told their services were no longer needed. These are career non-partisan apolitical staffers with a combined 150 years of experience at the State Department gone, just like that right off the top. That was followed by more senior staff layoffs last month and so far, at least, the people being let go are not being replaced. Tillerson himself has no deputy, for example. Latest plans from the administration call for a 37 percent cut to the agency`s budget, 37 percent. So far, there has been no sign of any public pushback against that from the secretary of state. When NBC`s Andrea Mitchell shouted a question to him about it a few days ago, he smiled and pretended he didn`t hear her asking but gave no answer. The primary agency responsible for rallying U.S.-led interests around the world appears to be having the air sucked out of it. If you are Russia and you are looking at that right now, do you love what you are seeing? You might be happy, I`m not sure, but you might be happy to see this guy exiting stage left. Until very recently, he was the third-most senior diplomat in the Foreign Service. He`s America`s longest-serving diplomat. He served six presidents over a 40-year career dating back to the Carter administration. He`s the department`s foremost Russia expert and he, too, is now leaving at a time when arguably the State Department needs it most, the State Department will not have the benefit of his insight going forward.

24,MADDOW," Allow me to quote. “My 40 years in the foreign service and the careers of many of my friends became associated with the fall of the Soviet Empire and the putting in order of what came after – the building of a Europe whole, free, and at peace. It`s hard to recall today how improbable victory in the Cold War appeared. For two generations up through the mid-1980s, many thought we were losing the Cold War, even in early 1989, few believed that Poland`s solidarity movement could win, that the Iron Curtain would come down, that the Baltic states could be free, that the second of the 20th century`s great evils, communism, could be vanquished without war, but it happened and the West`s great institutions, NATO and the E.U., grew to embrace 100 million liberated Europeans. It was my honor to have done what I could do to help. I learned to never underestimate the possibility of change, that values have power and that time and patience can pay off, especially if you`re serious about your objectives. Nothing can be taken for granted and this great achievement is now under assault by Russia. But what we did in my time is no less honorable. It is for the present generation to defend.” That is from the farewell speech of Ambassador Daniel Fried, former Ambassador Daniel Fried.

And both the Bush people and Obama people had no problem working with the holdovers. They weren`t out to get them.

54,MADDOW," We have news tonight about a new legal challenge to the president`s Muslim ban, the second version of the Muslim ban that was introduced this week. We reported last night that the state of Hawaii had filed the first lawsuit in federal court yesterday challenging the new Muslim ban. Well, now, tonight, the attorney general of Washington state has announced that he will also be challenging it, along with the state of Massachusetts. Now, the Washington state entry here is very interesting, because Attorney General Bob Ferguson, his last challenge to the first version of the ban is what stopped it in its track. He won that huge ruling against the first version of the Muslim ban that resulted in it being stopped dead in the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. Well, tonight, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson says he believes that same ruling that stopped the first version of the ban should still apply to the second version of the ban because it is basically the same ban. It is basically the same policy. You can hear that argument from him in person right now because he`s about to be a guest on “THE LAST WORD” with Ari Melber. That does it for us tonight. We will see you again tomorrow. Now, it`s time for “THE LAST WORD” with Ari Melber, sitting in for Lawrence tonight.

3,MADDOW," And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. On January 28, eight days after the inauguration this year, there was a fire at a mosque in Victoria, Texas. You might remember, we covered it on the show at the time. Victoria, Texas, is not a huge place, has a population of about 60,000 people and there are enough Muslims who live in Victoria, Texas, to support one Islamic center in that community. One mosque. But on January 28, this year, somebody burned it down, gutted it, destroyed it completely. One of the things that was very moving in the immediate aftermath of that tragedy, that crime, was when the other religious congregations in Victoria, Texas, came forward and offered the keys to their facilities, the keys to their houses of worship, they offered the keys to the imam from that mosque. So, his Muslim congregation could have somewhere else to meet and pray. Victoria, Texas, is small enough that it only had enough Muslims in town to support that one mosque. Victoria, Texas, only has enough Jews in town to support one synagogue for the whole city. The leader of that synagogue came forward to offer his keys to the local imam after the fire and he explained to reporters that sharing the space of the synagogue, sharing the synagogue with the membership of the mosque, he said, it just made sense, even if you`re only talking mathematically. He said, quote, “We have probably 25 to 30 Jewish people in all of Victoria, they probably have 100 Muslims. We have a lot of building for a small amount of Jews.” So, they made the offer. You might remember again. We covered that at the time. A lot of churches in town offered their keys to the imam. The local synagogue, they offered their keys to the imam, meet here. Let your community meet here. It was interesting, though, in addition to that local support that the mosque received in town, with all the other congregations coming forward to say what can we do? Use our space. Our space is your space. In addition to that what happened locally, what happened online was almost as overwhelming. The mosque – they put up an online fund-raising page to raise money to rebuild after their fire and in two days they received over $900,000 in pledges. After they hit $1.1 million they knew they had enough to rebuild, they stopped raising funds. But over 23,000 people came forward and donated. They got hundreds of thousands of dollars more than they had asked for. And that mosque fire is still not solved. Local authorities have declared it an arson. They have put out reward for information leading to an arrest but there is no one in custody. We spoke to the imam today. He told us they are making their plans to rebuild and hoping there will someday be an arrest. This weekend in St. Louis, Missouri, in the University City neighborhood of St. Louis, a Jewish cemetery that dates to the 1800s was the subject of another attack, nearly 200 headstones were thrown over, broken toppled in the cemetery. Local press has been full of these heartbreaking pictures of people turning up at the Jewish cemetery to find their grandparents` headstones, finding them broken and thrown over. This comes on the heels of Jewish community centers around the country facing several waves now of bomb threats and vandalism. The most recent spate of bomb threats happened just yesterday. In St. Louis, local police are investigating but there have been no arrests. But, look, this was part of the response online after the word got out today about what happened in that Jewish cemetery. See the headline? Muslims unite to repair Jewish cemetery. These folks set a goal of raising $20,000 by March 21st to contribute to the repair and the replacement if need be of those broken headstones in that Jewish cemetery. Again, their goal was $20,000 to be raised by March 21st. They raised over $20,000 today in three hours. In this case, they say they`re going to continue to raise money, at least for a while longer, quote, “Any additional funds raised in this campaign will assist vandalized Jewish centers nationwide.” But that $20,000 they raised today, that will go to the cemetery in St. Louis to repair those headstones. They say, quote, “Muslim Americans stand in solidarity with the Jewish community to condemn this act of desecration.” We are at an unusual time in our history, you might have noticed. National politics has veered and keeps veering in unexpected directions. It`s hard to know on any given day what is likely to happen next. That can sometimes be exhilarating. It`s mostly exhausting. But even in unpredictable times, some principles of human behavior, human reaction, human decency, right, still hold and what we are learning in this new era that we`re in, in this – in the Trump era, what we`re learning already, four weeks into this is no matter how strange things get in national politics, you can still count on Americans to do some predictable things. You still can count on the principle that in our politics, when there is an action, there will be a reaction. And as radical as these changes feel in Washington, the radical changes in Washington and the things they have made us worry about, they`re also causing a strong and serious change all over the country outside of Washington, in the cities and in the small towns, in red states and blue states, everywhere. And it`s not as easy to track, because it`s not all happening in one place with the national press corps there to look at it. But if you start looking for it, it`s almost stunning. In just a few minutes, we`ll talk in detail about the new mass deportation plans that have been outlined by the new administration as of today and the expectations for the new version of their Muslim ban and refugee ban they`re expected to roll out before the end of the week. That`s what`s happening in Washington. Part of the reaction to those orders and to those plans, part of the reaction we`ve seen in the courts. When the memos about the deportation plan started circulating today, the ACLU said this, quote, “President Trump does not have the last word on deportations, the courts and the public will not allow this un-American dream to become a reality.” So part of the response we`re seeing is legal and in the courts. Part is out in public and sometimes in surprising places. Today, someone somehow managed to unfurl a “Refugees Welcome” banner literally on the Statue of Liberty. I have no idea how they got out to the statue of liberty and got that banner on to it but that happened today. You also see the response in these public protests that we have seen on almost rolling basis, on an almost daily basis since the inauguration. We saw large protests this weekend mostly focused on the travel ban and in support of immigrants. We saw them in a lot of major cities over the last few days, in New York City, in Atlanta, in Los Angeles, in Chicago, in Washington, D.C. But you know what? It`s not just in the big cities where you are seeing this stuff. It`s also happening in unexpected places. We got in some footage today. Look at this, this is Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, of all places. “No wall, no ban.” Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Look at this one. This is from Ajo, Arizona. I think The name of the town is Ajo, Arizona, about 40 miles from Mexico. The population of the whole town of Ajo is like 3,700 people. Look how many people turned out for their protest – 3,700 people in the whole town, look how many people are protesting. “No ban, no wall.” This big anti-Trump protest in this little border town. So, we all know what`s happening in Washington. It`s easy to follow if sometimes hard to believe what`s happening in Washington. But the response is everywhere and it`s happening daily in ways large and small and the more you look, the more of it you see. Yes, it`s in the courts. Yes, it`s in some dramatic protests, but it`s also in the streets and not just where you might expect it to be in the streets. It`s also started already to affect straight up American politics. Let me give you one solid example of that. One of the practical consequences of these new deportation orders – and they don`t like to talk about it much yet in Washington, but they will have to soon – one of the practical consequences is that the new administration is going to apparently go back to using private-for-profit prisons to lock people up in federal facilities and immigration facilities. In the Obama administration, the Justice Department official who wrote an order, wrote the memo explaining that the federal government would no longer use private for-profit prisons, who wrote the whole rationale explaining why in the Obama administration, they were getting away from that because of the problems with private prisons, the justice official who wrote that directive in the Obama administration, who signed her name to that in the last administration was the then deputy attorney general, Sally Yates, right? OK. Sally Yates is now a household name. Sally Yates is now famous for her 10 very consequential days as acting attorney general after the Obama administration ended and the new administration started. Sally Yates is the one who warned the White House that National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was lying about his interactions with the Russian government. A week after that, she warned the White House that their Muslim ban was illegal, it was unconstitutional. She told them she would not direct the Justice Department to defend it in court. The new president fired Sally Yates for that. But, you know what, she`s been proven right and her assessment of how the courts would see that Muslim ban, the Muslim ban very quickly proved indefensible in court. The Trump administration has now tacitly conceded her point by withdrawing their Muslim ban and planning to draft a new one. So, I mean, you look at somebody like Sally Yates. Before one month ago she had an interesting and accomplished but low profile career as a prosecutor and as a Justice Department official. Now, she`s a household name. I mean, in moments like this, in moments of political transition you never know who`s going to be called to rise to the occasion. You never know who`s going to become an overnight hero because of the circumstances they find themselves in or because of actions they feel by conscience they must take. But now look at this. Sally Yates is from Georgia, she`s from Atlanta. This is Sally Yates last week, see her in the foreground there? This is an event at the Carter Center in Georgia. She walks into this room, this event at the Carter Cnter. She`s with former Attorney General Eric Holder. And, you can see, she`s embarrassed. She`s blushing there, but she`s sort of overwhelmed by the unexpected standing ovation that greets her at the Carter Center. Sally Yates was not even there to be in the event. She was not there to be on stage or on a panel or anything. She was just there to sit in the audience. But she walks in the room, no introduction necessary. Everybody knows who she is. She gets a sustained and overwhelming standing ovation. Eric Holder backs up to let her soak in the applause, and even though she`s not on the panel the audience questions ended up getting directed at her, Sally United States, will you please run for Congress? Sally Yates, will you please run for Senate? Sally Yates, we know who you are now. We`d love you to run. Georgia Democrats now say they are seriously lobbying Sally Yates to run for Georgia governor when that seat opens up next year. That`s Georgia. Look at Virginia. Virginia is a blue state now in many ways. Went for Obama in `08, went for Obama in 2012, went for Hillary Clinton in November by more than five points. That said, a lot of Virginia is still very deep red. The legislature is still Republican by a little bit in the Senate and by a lot in the House. Virginia holds their elections in odd-numbered years so their legislature is up in 2015. They`re up again this year, 2017. And, you know, Southern Democratic parties, including Virginia, have become notorious in recent years for not even bothering to run Democratic challengers in a lot of red districts, not even bothering to try. That apparently is no longer going to be the case. That is not going to be a problem this year in Virginia. Virginia Democrats have identified 17 districts in the state this year where Hillary Clinton won the presidential race but the local state legislator is a Republican. Virginia Democrats tell us tonight they have recruited Democratic challengers to run for the legislature in every single one of those 17 districts. In fact, they tell us they have already succeeded in recruiting Democratic challengers against Republican incumbents in 45 districts. They`re already – they`ve already got candidates to challenge 45 Republican incumbents. That`s way more Democratic challengers than they have ever run in recent years. And it`s still a ways off from the deadline. Deadline for filling for the primaries isn`t until March 30th. But they`ve already got Democratic challengers to 45 Republican incumbents. The Democratic caucus chair in the Virginia house tells us tonight Democrats are seeing, quote, “unprecedented interest” from potential candidates. She tells us, quote, “We have never felt so much energy so early as we are feeling now.” The House Democratic leader in Virginia told us tonight they believe Virginia this year will be, quote, “The first referendum on the divisive and chaotic presidency of Donald Trump.” And, obviously Virginia Democrats think that that kind of referendum will go their way. And apparently, it`s not just places like Georgia and Virginia where this is happening. This appears to be the national phenomenon. The leadership of the DCCC, which is the House campaign committee for the Democratic Party, they did an issue about their recruitment efforts to find candidates across the country. Again, this is for federal candidates for Congress. They say their priorities are to find candidates in districts where right now there is a Republican incumbent member of Congress but Hillary Clinton won that district. Or Hillary Clinton only lost by a little, she lost by four points or less. That`s their priority for finding Democratic recruitment for Democratic candidates for Congress. How are they doing at finding candidates? Well, the recruitment chair for the DCCC tells the “National Journal” that actually being recruitment chair is usually kind of hard. He says in years past, quote, “Getting somebody to run was like pulling eyeteeth each and every time. It was very hard to get people to say I see this as part of public service. I see this as a part of my patriotic duty.” Now though, quote, “It`s not hard to get people to see it that way at all.” “Now,” says the recruitment chair for the Democratic Party trying to find Democratic candidates for Congress, now he says, quote, “We are raining candidates.” This is an unpredictable time in our national life. I mean, what has changed in Washington has changed the way people spend their time around the country. These Indivisible groups that formed around this indivisible guide for practical politics for influencing Congress and stopping the Trump agenda, that Indivisible movement – there`s more than 7,000 Indivisible groups that have formed in all 50 states. More than 7,000 of them. And that`s just the Indivisible groups. What`s changed in Washington has caused individual people who never wanted to run for Congress before, who never wanted to run for office before, it`s caused individual people to change their lives, change their priorities to volunteer to run. Districts in Virginia where they`ve never had a Democrat run at all in recent years now have one, two, three, four Democrats competing in the primary because they want to run. What`s happened in Washington this year has changed the lives of people already in politics as well people already in Congress, already in the Senate. You know that this week, Congress is off for the Presidents` Day holiday, they take a week-long recess and they`re expected to go home to their districts and meet with constituents. For Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis of Florida, this is what it looks like outside of his district office back home. “Investigate Putin-gate.” These are constituents telling him what they want to do in Florida. “It`s called treason, Trump and Putin.” This is outside the office of Republican Congressman Mike Kelly in Pennsylvania, “Meet with us, Congressman Kelly.” Republican Congressman John Katko, his constituents in Syracuse, New York, have been demanding over and over he meet with them to hear their concerns about the Trump administration. After all that pressure on him, the local paper jumped on board today and – yesterday and published this editorial, “Representative Katko should meet with his constituents.” Congresswoman Kay Granger, Republican representing Fort Worth, Texas, she went home for a Republican Lincoln Day dinner this week. This was a scene that greeted her outside. In Tennessee, this is the district office of Republican Congressman Scott DesJarlais. In New Jersey, this is what Republican Congressman Leonard Lance is having to deal with in his home district. People, darn people singing outside his office trying to meet with him all the time. In Buffalo, New York, Trump supporting Congressman Chris Collins, look at this. His district is dealing with boisterous crowds who do not appear to agree with his support of Donald Trump. This is Chris Collins` district office in Buffalo. His down state colleague, Republican Congressman Dan Donovan, is dealing with much the same thing. His constituents standing outside his local district office yesterday yelling “Whose side are you on, Dan, who side are you on?” It`s getting to the point where it`s embarrassing at the grocery store. Look at the milk jugs there. Republican Congressman Paul Cook represents a big rural district in California. These are the milk jugs at the – you can get at the grocery stores in his district. They say “Where is Paul cook? Pray for Paul. Congressman Paul is missing, he won`t meet with his constituents.” When members of Congress and senators meet with their constituents, we`re getting a sense of what that looks like, no matter how red the state is. Chuck Grassley of Iowa prides himself on being super available to his constituents and holding meetings all over the state of Iowa. He`s been doing that for a long time but they don`t usually go like they went today.",1,18573.0,3188.0,host,4.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21

16,MADDOW," And then she left. That`s going to be our last question. No! . She leaves the room, they`re screaming “shame on you.” Very rough meeting of the minds in Iowa for Senator Joni Ernst today. Here`s the thing to take away from that experience, from just seeing how that went today. That happened in a place called Maquoketa, Iowa. Maquoketa, Iowa, I`ve been practicing saying it all evening. Maquoketa. Maquoketa, Iowa, is population 6,000 people. And that`s the reception that Joni Ernst got in Maquoketa today from that mostly older, mostly white crowd, right in the middle of Iowa. It is easy to get bowled over with what`s going on in Washington with the scope of the changes in Washington, the radical shift that`s happened in our national politics with this new presidency. But I`m telling you, there is as radical a shift in the rest of the country in the opposite direction. It`s an equal and opposition reaction. It`s just everywhere. It`s in the courts, it`s in the streets, it`s in the lives of our elected officials. It`s everywhere to the point that even that dynamic is starting to feel unpredictable and starting to feel a little overwhelming as well. But watch this unfold over the course of this week. Watch what it`s going to be like for these representatives and senators at home this week. This whole week is going to be like this in the states. Keep your eyes open.",1,1383.0,244.0,host,17.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21
17,MADDOW," Our three branches of government – the courts, the executive, the legislative branch – they are built as equal things, co-equal things. They`re supposed to be separate and they`re supposed to balance each other out. They`re supposed to check each other`s power when necessary. But there are other checks on political power as well besides just the balance between the three different branches. One of the most uncomfortable checks on political power comes from inside the government, comes from the people who work inside the government – the people with precious knowledge and experience who are doing their jobs to make government work, to make the country work. And sometimes, in times of political crisis or political radicalism, one of the most dramatic and uncomfortable checks we have on government is when those people squawk. When those people emerge from the relative anonymity of working inside the government and they blow the whistle or they quit so they can speak their mind and that is starting to happen now. Some of these valuable, crucial people are opting out, include from some very high-profile jobs because they`ve decided the government they have committed themselves to is no longer holding up its end of the bargain, not in this administration. Tonight, we`ve got a double header for the interview. We`ve got with us two people who have just resigned from high profile important influential jobs in the government. They have both resigned for similar reasons. You`re going to want to hear their stories. Those two interviews are straight ahead.

18,MADDOW," The day after the inauguration, the new president paid a visit to the CIA. The president stood in front of a memorial wall with 117 hand-carved stars on it. Each of those stars commemorates a CIA officer killed in the line of duty. Standing in front of that wall, standing in front of all those stars, the new president bragged about his big win in November, bragged about the size of the crowd in his inauguration. He talked about how much he hates the press. And, for one career official who worked at the CIA for over a decade, a man named Ned Price, that presidential bragging in that particular spot hit a nerve. Ned Price says his mentor at the CIA was killed in the line of duty and is one of the people memorialized with a star on that wall. Ned Price says he thought he would spend his entire career working for the CIA but after all his years of service, including rising to the spokesman for the National Security Council, after living through just one month of this new presidency, Ned Price decided he would not be a career CIA official because he had to quit. He`s written about in “The Washington Post,” he says, quote, “White House advisers, not career professionals, reportedly now have final say over what intelligence reaches the president`s desk. As intelligence professionals, we`re taught to tune out politics but this administration has flipped that dynamic on its head. The politicians are the ones tuning out the intelligence professionals. Despite working proudly for Republican and Democratic presidents, I reluctantly concluded I cannot in good faith serve this administration as an intelligence professional.” Joining us now is Ned Price. Until last week, he worked at the CIA as a spokesman and senior analyst. He also served as a spokesman and senior director at the National Security Council. Mr. Price, thanks very much for being here. Really appreciate you making the time for us tonight.",1,1923.0,332.0,host,19.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21
19,"EDWARD PRICE, RESIGNED FROM CIA DUE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP"," Thanks for having me, Rachel.",1,30.0,6.0,guest,20.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21
20,MADDOW, Did you expect when you saw the election results on November 8 that you might be entering into a period where your tenure at the CIA would be untenable? That you might come up with a decision like this or were you truly surprised with the president`s behavior once he took office?,1,281.0,53.0,host,21.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21
21,PRICE," Well, Rachel, my resignation which I tendered last week was the culmination in a series of events that took place over the course of many months. As you have reported, I was highly discouraged when as the Republican nominee, the now president, called into question the high competence assessment of all 17 intelligence agencies vis-a-vis Russia`s meddling in our electoral process. I saw him as a president-elect call the intelligence community, essentially called them Nazis, not knowing that the predecessor of the CIA actually was critical to the defeat of the Third Reich in the Second World War. And then, as you mentioned, the visit to the CIA headquarters and seeing this – our new president, the commander in chief stand before the most solemn site in all of Langley, a site that their stars representing the 117 men and women who have fallen in the line of duty, that for me was something I did not expect to see. It was hugely demoralizing and I know that others at the agency felt similarly. But there were, there was subsequent steps that unfortunately led me to the move I made last week.",1,1102.0,193.0,guest,22.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21
22,MADDOW," You said earlier today that you think you maybe able to do more good for your country outside of the CIA now, having quit, rather than if you had stayed inside at your old job. Can you tell me a little bit about how you`re thinking about that? What you might do now in terms of what you`re going to do next and how hard the decision was that you had to go?",1,357.0,74.0,host,23.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21
23,PRICE," Well, as you said, I aspired to be a CIA officer for all of my life until I joined the CIA in 2006. It was an honor and I was humbled to get that – to be called on board earlier that year. But, you know, Rachel, I had two options as I watched these data points over the proceeding weeks and months. One was to stay on board at the CIA and to accrue a salary at the expense of taxpayers and to write assessments, unbiased, unvarnished assessments for an administration that in my estimation had shown little regard – has shown little regard for the sort of outside opinion, outside information, the assessments that the CIA and our colleagues throughout the intelligence community that form our bread and butter essentially. So, the question before me was, do I continue doing something that I thought was futile and would have little impact on policy or should I leave and do something where I thought I could fulfill the same mission that I signed up for in 2006 and that`s to serve the American people? I don`t exactly know what that entails. This is new to me and I certainly don`t have anything I`m running off to, but I`m certainly going to attempt to do my best to fulfill that charge, the same charge that I signed up for in 2006.",1,1238.0,232.0,guest,24.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21
24,MADDOW," Ned, I know you can`t obviously speak to anything that you`re not supposed to talk about publicly and I`m not asking you to go into stuff that you shouldn`t be able to go into in a public forum. But we have had some sort of weird leaks and some contested leaks concerning the CIA and concerning the way that intelligence is handled by this new administration and there was a disputed report in the “Wall Street Journal” last week, disputed by the White House ultimately. But what the “Wall Street Journal” reported on the basis of anonymous leaks was that U.S. intelligence officials have been withholding sensitive intelligence information from the White House, keeping stuff from the president because they don`t trust him, because they`re concerned letting him in on sources and methods might be leaked or compromised to other countries. Obviously, it`s leaked information. There`s no names associated with this stuff. The White House is disputing it. But can I ask your opinion about how we should view a leak like that? Whether that`s even – whether that`s feasible, whether that`s hyperbole or something that we should be concerned about?",1,1145.0,192.0,host,25.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21
25,PRICE," I sure hope it`s hyperbole. The president of the United States is considered the first customer by the intelligence community. The morning intelligence briefing, the president`s daily brief, contains the most sensitive information available to the United States government. It`s something that I had the great honor of helping to compile when I was at CIA. And the president should be privy to everything in our disposal that will help him make policy and make better policy to protect the American people. I cannot imagine a scenario in which intelligence professionals would judge that the commander in chief is not – it`s not safe to share information with the commander in chief. I can`t speak to the accuracy of that report, but as I said, I sure hope it`s not true.",1,772.0,132.0,guest,26.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21
26,MADDOW," Ned price, former spokesman and analyst at the CIA, former spokesman and senior director at the National Security Council, recently resigned from the CIA because of the direction of this administration – Mr. Price, thank you very much for talking with us tonight, and good luck.

28,MADDOW," Appreciate it. All right. As I mentioned tonight, we are doing a double header. We`re doing sort of a feature on high-ranking influential officials who have found that they can no longer continue to serve in our government because of the direction of the new administration. Up next, our second guest, an official who has just resigned from a very important and influential government job. She joins us next. Stay with us.",1,423.0,73.0,host,29.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21
29,MADDOW," When she was still in California, Ann Ravel led the first ever investigation that specifically named the Koch brother`s network for the way its members moved money around in the shadows. Over the ever lasting protests of the Koch brothers, Ann Ravel, California regulator, she put in the writing. She called out the, quote, “Koch brothers` dark money network” and demanded one of the network members pay a million-dollar fine for violating campaign finance rules. And if that didn`t put enough of a target on her back, the week after she announced that decision, Ann Ravel started her new job in Washington. She started work as President Obama`s new appointee to the Federal Election Commission. And the makeup of that organization is an important thing. It traditionally has six members – three Democrats and three Republicans – and you need four members on it to do anything. And even though the FEC is in charge of a really important thing, they`re in charge of enforcing our nation`s laws about money in politics. In recent years, that makeup of that body, that half Democratic/half Republican setup has meant the FEC doesn`t do much of anything. They don`t do very much enforcing of our laws on politics and money because they`re gridlocked. They`re locked in partisan stasis and Ann Ravel seemed frustrated about that almost from the start.",1,1347.0,227.0,host,30.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21

32,MADDOW," Ann Ravel gave that heroic “Daily Show” interview in 2015. I should tell you, her term on the FEC goes through April 30th. Conceivably, her time at the FEC could last well beyond that. It could stay as a holdover when your time expires, until the president appoints somebody new to replace you. All the other members of the FEC are holdovers right now. But instead of hanging around for more of the same, this week, Ann Ravel filed a report on the commission`s dysfunction and deadlock – her words, not mine – dysfunction and deadlock – and she quit. She submitted her resignation to the new president. She tells the “New York Times” now, quote, “I think I could be more effective on the outside.” We have heard that more than once today. We`ve heard that more than once in the last few minutes. Joining us now is Ann Ravel. She`s the outgoing Democratic member of the Federal Election Commission who has just resigned. Commissioner Ravel, thank you very much for joining us tonight. I really appreciate you being here.",1,1020.0,182.0,host,33.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21

39,RAVEL," Well, it – as you indicated, it has been clear to me that the agency is dysfunctional and that we`re unable to perform the functions that Congress intended that we would do and really the FEC, while it`s a little-known agency, it`s so important in establishing and maintaining the fairness of our electoral process. So, I feel really committed to the work and – that it needs to be done fairly and rationally. Also I`ve been an elected official – not an elected, an official in public service for most of my career, and one of the things that is the hallmark of a public servant is that you are there to do the public`s work and if you`re not able to, then you can`t continue is my view. And so, all of those things came together to make me realize that it made no sense for me to continue and that as the previous guest said, I could be more effective on the outside.",1,869.0,166.0,guest,40.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21
40,MADDOW," In making this exit, you have called on the new president to prioritize the reform of money in politics. Prioritize the reform of campaign finance to fix the political system that he described as broken. Do you actually expect that from him? Do you think that this administration, that in this president, could be part of the solution to what you feel is so broken in this system that you`re quitting now?",1,406.0,73.0,host,41.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21
41,RAVEL," Well, I wouldn`t say that I expect it. I always like to be optimistic and hope that because he was so clear about the terrible state of campaign finance when he was a candidate and how he wasn`t beholden to anybody like all the other candidates were that maybe he will take that to heart and do something about campaign finance. But, obviously, after my time in Washington, I`m also cynical. And so, I think it will be unlikely, especially given who he has surrounded himself with, for example, who his general counsel is.",1,523.0,95.0,guest,42.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21
42,MADDOW," His general counsel is somebody who has a past on the FEC, who served their under George W. Bush, Don McGahn. He`s obviously been one of the more controversial members of the new administration in terms of what he`s been involved with. He`s also somebody who sort of credited or blamed with bringing about the kind of gridlock that you have named and shamed at that commission. When you think about that past, when you look at the appointment this is president has made, are you at all worried about who he`s going to replace you with? I mean, by tradition, Senate Democrats would be picking somebody to replace you because there would be another Democrat who would put on the commission.

47,RAVEL," Well, I think he may go off the reservation with regard to the replacements at the commission, but I don`t think that my leaving makes any difference in that. Because as you said, all of the commissioners are holdovers. Many of them probably on the Republican side would like to go into the administration. So, the likelihood is that the president will replace, at least, four of the members of the commission.

56,MADDOW," So last night, we did a story about this Vladimir Putin-connected, super sketchy, Russian-speaking Ukrainian oligarch who also has connections to former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. This Oligarch has been stuck in legal limbo in Austria for three years now. American prosecutors have been trying to get Austrians to – the Austrians to extradite him to the United States. A grand jury in the United States has indicted him on bribery charges and during the Obama administration, federal prosecutors in the United States wanted to bring him to this country to face bribery charges. Well, today, was a test of whether or not the Trump Justice Department would proceed with that legal effort. And today, an Austrian court said, yes, he can be extradited to the United States. Austrian court said this oligarch, his name is Dmitry Firtash, the court in Austria said he should be extradited to the United States. OK, interesting, right? No, we still don`t actually know what`s going to happen here. This is where things get nutty, because there`s yet another twist to this amazing story. After today`s ruling in this courtroom in Vienna, he left with his lawyers and his supporters, headed to the courthouse elevator, got in, took the elevator down to the first floor. But when he got off, watch what happened.",1,1314.0,221.0,host,57.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21

58,MADDOW," When he got off the elevate we are police officers were waiting there to arrest him. What? That was unexpected. Police took him away. And what they arrested him for, has nothing to do with the American charges that he was just in a hearing about on the other floor of that courthouse. Turns out, Spain also made an extradition request for that same guy for a different case. They want him to be extradited to Spain to face charges in that country. And even though the Spanish made that request last year, Austria decided that today, minutes after his American extradition hearing, today that would be as good a time as any to arrest him on those other European charges. So, frankly, right now, it`s anybody`s guess as to how this effects whether or not this guy gets extradited to the U.S. Maybe he`ll get extradited to Spain instead. We raised this last night, this is worth following from an American perspective because of the open question as to whether the Justice Department under the Trump administration is going to go after Putin`s friends, whether the Trump administration Justice Department would go after a Putin-linked oligarch. Would they bring him back to this country to face charges or would they let it slide? We still don`t know if he`s coming back to this country to face charges. It got really weird today in that courthouse elevator. We`ll stay on it. I don`t know. Watch this space. That does it for us tonight. We`ll see you again tomorrow. Now, it`s time for “THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL”. Good evening, Lawrence.",1,1549.0,272.0,host,59.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-21

0,"RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST"," Thanks at home for joining us at this hour. Nice to have you with us here on a Friday night. George “The Animal” Steele died today. If you, like me, watched wrestling in the 1980s, you will remember George “The Animal” Steele, right? His whole this shtick was that he was really hairy, he had a lot of back hair. And so, his nickname was “The Animal”, because he was hairy. And he would sort of act in an animalistic manner. He would tear things up with his teeth, he`d stick his tongue out at a weird angle and make crazy googly eyes at the camera. It sort of made it out like he was almost – half animal, half man, or like maybe half having a seizure but really just angry. George “The Animal” Steele, one of the great lovable wrestling bad guys. And he died today at the age of 79. Seventy-nine for a pro-wrestler, starting to feel like that is kind of a ripe old age. A lot of the famous wrestlers of that era, the wrestlers that I grew up watching when I came home from elementary school on TV, a lot of those wrestlers in that era have died in recent years and they died at unsettlingly young ages. One of the most recognizable female wrestlers ever, Chyna, she died at the age of 46. Randy Savage, he was 58 when he died. Rowdy Roddy Piper, remember him? He was one of the great characters of wrestling, he died in 2015. He was only 61. There was a wrestler I remember who was sort of a strange character in terms of his character, the way he played scripts and wrestling. He went by the name the Ultimate Warrior. He was only 54 when he died. The CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, Linda McMahon, was just confirmed to a cabinet position in the Trump administration. And who knows, Linda McMahon may turn out to be a great chief of the Small Business Administration. But the business she comes from does have a dark side to it. I mean, the trail of dead performers she leaves behind at the business she ran with her husband is unsettling, and it keeps coming up in part because wrestling is an odd sidebar interest for this new administration. I mean, right, there`s a lot of weird things about this new administration but one of them is the wrestling connection. We`ve all seen the crazy tape, right, the man who`s now the president of the United States having a big fake fight on the side of the ring at a big pro-wrestling match, right? You know, actually, while he was having that scripted fake fight, the featured performer in the ring, who was just finishing his wrestling match, that guy there, that was the guy who was 34 years old at the time. He went by the name Umaga. He was 34 years old when Donald Trump had that cameo fight in the middle of his wrestling match. He was dead less than two years later. He was dead by the time he was 36. So, who knew we`d ever have a presidential administration with lots of ties to the weird dark world of pro-wrestling? But we do. When George “The Animal” Steele, passed away today, the highest profile pro-wrestler of them all, the most famous pro-wrestler of this whole era, Hulk Hogan, paid his respects to George Steele. He wrote on Twitter, George “The Animal” Steele, quote, “Rest in peace, my brother.” Hulk Hogan in the 1980s and 1990s was very, very well known as a wrestler. He was probably the highest-profile star that they had. I don`t know how you quantify that. But that`s how it seemed to me as a kid. But a wrestling career can`t last forever and even though he was a huge deal in the `80s and `90s, maybe even a little further than that, he really had faded from the spotlight for a while when in 2012 he briefly became famous again for not wrestling but, forgive me, for a sex tape. The web site Gawker, which was proudly profane, Gawker they did a lot of celebrity coverage. They also did a lot of serious journalism, too, but Gawker in 2012 decided to publish snippets of a tape in which Hulk Hogan could be seen having sex with someone who was not his wife, who was, in fact, somebody else`s wife and no, I`m not going to show you images from the tape, you can use your imagination or not, I don`t know if you`ve eaten. OK, it existed. Hulk Hogan reportedly had his personal lawyer threaten Gawker and tell them they needed to take that tape down but Gawker didn`t take it down. But then lucky for Hulk Hogan, it turned out that Gawker had a very, very rich, very vindictive enemy who was watching this sex tape story unfold from afar. A Silicon Valley eccentric conservative billionaire who had been nursing a grudge against Gawker for years because of the way Gawker covered him and his personal life in his Silicon Valley career, and that eccentric conservative billionaire secretly arranged to bankroll a legal fight against Gawker on behalf of this previously famous wrestler with now the minorly famous sex tape. I don`t know if he was a wrestling fan, too. I don`t know if he had any particular affection for Hulk Hogan, but what he ended up bankrolling was not a typical, you know, celebrity/public figure complaint against a publication. The point of that lawsuit that he bankrolled was not to get Gawker to take the sex tape down. It was not to get Gawker to retract the story or apologize, the point of the lawsuit wasn`t even to get Gawker to pay. The point of that lawsuit, the whole structure of this novel legal strategy they came up with for going after Gawker in that case, the whole point of it, was not to make Gawker pay, not to make Gawker feel financial pain. The point of it was to make Gawker disappear as a publication. Not to punish them, not to get compensation or apology for Hulk Hogan, it was to make that publication go out of business permanently and irretrievably. And it worked. It cost about $10 million in legal fees but if you`re a billionaire, what do you care? It took ten million of his dollars, it took three and a half years, it 100 percent worked. They sued Gawker in a Florida courtroom for $100 million. They got out of the injury a $140 million verdict. Part of what they had originally claimed in the lawsuit was that Gawker had negligently inflicted emotional stress. There`s no reason the Hogan side couldn`t have prevailed in their lawsuit as well. But at a strategic moment in the case, they dropped that specific part of their claim and as best as we can tell the reason they dropped that specific part of their claim where they very well might have prevailed, that I dropped it because had they prevailed on that point, Gawker`s insurance would have kicked in. Gawker`s insurance would have had to pay the settlement had that been the grounds on which the lawsuit was decided. Rather than do that and get the settlement, they dropped that claim from the lawsuit so Gawker`s insurance company was off the hook. Gawker`s insurance company wouldn`t have to pay. And then they proceed with the lawsuit on the rest of the grounds and Gawker itself had to pay out of its own pocket. And that is how Peter Thiel, Silicon Valley conservative billionaire, that`s how he used an aging pro-wrestler who, as far as we know, he had never met, to secretly develop a novel legal strategy specifically designed for the American court system. Not just to punish or harass publications that printed stuff you don`t like, but rather to eliminate publications that publish something that you don`t like and that in his case once published something about him and his personal life that he didn`t want to be published. He figured out how to disappear them as his revenge. That verdict in the Hulk Hogan case, that was almost a year ago. Gawker, indeed, as designed, went bankrupt, disappeared off the face of the earth last year. In the meantime, last year, Peter Thiel took on a prominent role in the Donald Trump presidential campaign, including speaking at the Republican national convention while Gawker was literally in the midst of firing all of its staff and its founder was filing for personal bankruptcy. After Trump won the election, Peter Thiel reportedly got to work helping staff up the new administration and helping organize meetings for the new president and the tech community, his old allies in Silicon Valley. At one point, Peter Thiel floated himself as a Supreme Court nominee. Oh, really? That was a dark day. But even though he hasn`t taken on a formal job title in the new administration, he did give the new president one granular very specific human gift. He gave him his lawyer. He gave the president that lawyer who he used to disappear Gawker, the one he used to invent this novel aggressive litigation strategy by which deep pocketed legal aggressors can sue out of existence, a publication that they don`t like. The lawyers name is Charles Harter and he is now representing the first lady of the United States, Melania Trump, in a $150 million lawsuit that she`s filed against a newspaper the “Daily Mail”, as well as a conspiracy theorist/blogger both of whom posted unfounded claims about Melania Trump claiming she worked as an escort. There appears to be no evidence that ever she did, they published claims to the contrary and they`re looking down the barrel of a $150 million lawsuit filed by the guy who made Gawker disappear. When Donald Trump started settling the fraud cases against him and his businesses before the inauguration, I think a lot of people assumed that was a signal the Trump family would give up their various personal lawsuits now that they were ascending to the White House. That may be the case about fraud stuff, but that`s not the case when it comes to media stuff. That is not the case when it comes to this aggressive case filed by the first lady against this newspaper and this blog. Not only did she not drop it after the election but it appears to be pedal to the metal. But the blogger and the newspaper retracted these stories they posted about Melania Trump, they both issued not just retractions but apologies for those stories. But still, she persisted with the lawsuit. The blogger part of it has now been settled for an undisclosed sum. We tried to figure out the sum, we really can`t figure it out. The lawsuit against the newspaper is proceeding and it`s not just sort of happening by remote control at a distance from the first family. I think everybody was surprised in December when there was a routine scheduling conference in a Maryland courtroom related to this lawsuit. Lawyers and the judge were there working out future court dates and scheduling stuff, this is not a key moment in the trial where you would expect either the plaintiffs or defendants to show up in person. But at that hearing in December in Maryland, in walked Melania Trump in person. The incoming first lady, she appeared in person at that low-level court hearing in this case apparently to show her personal commitment to seeing this case through. The venue for that trial has now been moved from Maryland to New York, so now the first lady will presumably find it even easier to attend in person to this $150 million lawsuit she is pursuing with this very particular lawyer who has done this before and there is one less news outlet in the world because of it. At about 4:30 this afternoon, the president tweeted this. “The fake news media, failing New York Times, CNN, NBC News and many more, is not my enemy. It is the enemy of the American people. Sick.” He posted that around 4:30 and then he quickly deleted it. There was a flurry of news interest, right? Oh, temper got the best of him butut he realized that was too far. He realized you can`t say stuff like that in a country with the First Amendment. He deleted it, took it back. Got a little hot under the collar there but cooler heads prevailed. Yes, no, 15 minutes later he posted it again. This time he had to delete the word “sick” at the end because he had to make space to add in the names of more news organizations. So, now, the enemy of the American people is not just “New York Times,” CNN, and NBC, now it`s ABC news and CBS News, all the enemy of the American people. First of all, I mean, who cares what he tweets, right? At one level. Yes. You know? But on this issue all presidents fight with the press. All presidents arguably hate the press to a certain extent but there is something different here than what we have seen in the past. I mean, just in terms of the rhetoric and tenor and tone and the sort of viciousness of it. The previous low, the worst we thought it could get, the worst was probably the Nixon era, right? That`s when Vice President Spiro Agnew called the press the nattering nabobs s of negativism. Nixon himself had his famously catastrophic press conference, October 1972, where he had this exchange with Robert Pierpoint from CBS News.",1,12705.0,2303.0,host,1.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-17

5,MADDOW," That was previously thought of as kind of the lowest, right? The most direct public attack on the legitimacy of the American press by an American president. That was the bar before today but now the press is the enemy of the American people. And it`s not just the insults to the press, insults to individual reporters, calling the news media fake, it`s also the way they`re running their press operations in the briefing room. We got news this week, for example, that the administration has started giving White House press credentials to random pro-Trump blogs. Do you remember during the Republican National Convention, there was a deliberately controversial, deliberately provocative anti-Islam event held in the sidelines of the Republican convention under the banner “Gays for Trump”? And you might remember some of the visuals for that event were a little weird. Like they got this news media to show up and people are like, “Can we turn on our cameras?” Because there were these big soft core pseudo foreigny pictures of super pale blond white guys wearing Trump hats in various states of undress, right? Remember those kind of weird point? Literally the guy who took those photos is now an accredited White House correspondent. They gave that guy a White House press pass from a very pro-Trump right wing blog. The Aryan Trump twink photo guy now reporting in a suit, thank God, from the White House. I mean, some of it is funny. The way the White House is waging war on the press, trying to delegitimize the press, it`s a full range of ridiculous stuff like that to some serious stuff. This week for example, we learned the president`s son-in-law, also his senior adviser summoned a Time Warner executive to the White House so he could complain to him about political coverage on CNN. Apparently, the president`s son-in-law singled out specific on-air commentators and berated this executive from CNN`s parent company Time Warner about the content of CNN`s coverage and his issues with it. That same parent company of CNN, they have a big merger they want to do with AT&T, permission is pending with the federal government. Right before the election, Trump himself said that under his government, that merger will never be approved. All but openly admitting at the time it`s because he doesn`t like the way CNN covers him. And so, he`ll use the powers of the federal government to punish them, to punish that business for that coverage. And then you summon the executive of the parent company for a dressing down and you name the commentators you don`t like? It`s a whole range of stuff they`re doing. Everything from threatening a pretty serious abuse of power in order to punish news organizations and shape their coverage, everything from that to the petty one-on-one bullying that you see in the briefing room and these laughable efforts to delegitimize the press, the real news media by putting them on the same footing as this guy and LifeZette and some random pro-Trump activist who Skypes into the briefing room. And some of this is funny, you know? Especially some of what happens in the briefing room is probably worth enduring just so we can see Melissa McCarthy do this for four years before Sean Spicer`s head explodes in real life. All presidents have hated the press and who cares? Right? I think journalists by and large are tough. I think people expect politicians to hate the press. I think Americans by and large appreciate the First Amendment and how important it is to have a free press. In general I am wired to not worry about this too much. As a member of the press, I don`t generally think what affects us as an institution is ever the most important thing going on in the country. But remember I said a few days ago I was looking at the administration as a silent movie. Like don`t listen to what they`re saying, especially if they`re saying stuff that turns out not to be true all the time? Focus less on what they`re saying, watch what they`re doing. With all of the attention to what they are saying to the press, what they are saying about the press, how they are taunting the press, teasing the press, deriding the press, treating the press, OK. But don`t just pay attention to what they`re saying. It`s not just talk. Watch what they`re doing. It`s really important to notice as this administration declares its particular war on the press that it`s more than just talk, it`s more than just the threats and bullying and complaining. Whatever you think of Gawker.com as a journalistic enterprise, Gawker.com does not exist anymore because of a tailored billionaire legal strategy that made them go away and that strategy and literally that strategist and the lawyer he used to affect that change on the American journalistic landscape to disappear that outlet, that is now operating on behalf of the White House, on behalf of the first family. And what is otherwise a low profile case that doesn`t feel like the most important thing in the world, until some day they decide to build on that track record of disappearing publications, disappearing newspapers, disappearing their critics in the press and thereby disappearing press freedom that makes our country literally what it is. Right? That makes all presidents hate the press as much they do. Watch this little legal case. Watch this lawyer. Watch this legal strategy because it is more than just talk. It is something different. And it`s going to require a whole new level of defense.",1,5481.0,944.0,host,6.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-17

8,"JOHN F. KENNEDY, FORMER PRESIDENT"," Oh, it is. No, no, I think it`s invaluable even though it may cause you some – it`s never pleasant to be reading things frequently that are not agreeable news. But I would say it`s an invaluable arm of the presidency as a check, really, on what`s going on in administration and more things come to my attention that cause me concern or give me information. So I would think that Mr. Khrushchev, operating a totalitarian system, which has many advantages of being able to move in secret and all the rest, there`s a terrific disadvantage not having the abrasive quality of the press applied to you daily to an administration. When you have – even though we never like it and even though we don`t – even though we wish they didn`t write it, even though we disapprove, there still is – there isn`t any doubt that we couldn`t do the job at all in a free society without a very, very active press.",1,892.0,166.0,guest,9.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-17
9,MADDOW," President Kennedy gave that interview in 1962 after getting a lot of bad press following the Bay of Pigs disaster. He was so mad about it, he sat down for a totally reasonable interview with NBC News and made the case that even though sometimes we wish they did not write it, even still, we could not do the job at all in a free society without a very, very active press. You need an active press for a democracy to thrive. That`s what differentiates us from a totalitarian system. That sort of used to be the standard for an angry president going off on the press. That standard clearly now has changed. Are we just looking at a ruder iteration of something we`ve seen in the past or are we really on new ground?

11,MADDOW," So, we`ve been looking at obviously this administration, like all administrations that have come before them, yelling at the press, complaining about the press, and saying the press doesn`t give them a fair shake.

14,BRENNER," I mean, I don`t think that`s the lesson of the Gawker case. I agree it`s scary that you have a billionaire who gets sort of mad and takes a vendetta out, you know, against a news organization. That`s kind of scary – nothing illegal about it but scary. But I`m not sure there`s that much of a lesson from the Gawker case other than maybe don`t get in the sex tape selling business. Really, it was a pretty unusual case in that you`ve got a hometown favoritism to Hulk Hogan. You`ve got a celebrity, juries love celebrities, especially one as sort of fun as Hulk Hogan. You`ve got Gawker on the side which reveled in being offensive. And jurors, you know, they don`t – it`s not true that they come into court and think, oh, yes, it`s the press, First Amendment, that`s great, they can do whatever they want. You have to explain the First Amendment to them. In the Gawker case, the verdict is not precedent for anything. It`s not a court of appeal decision.

It`s certainly a private life and family life because she`s decided to stay away from Washington. But this case that she`s brought against the “Daily Mail,” this isn`t a sex tape case. They`ve made false allegations that they have retracted and apologized for but a retraction isn`t enough. They`re trying to get $150 million out of this newspaper. Do you see it as a totally separate thing from what happened with the Gawker approach?

21,MADDOW," My favorite thing about that is how into it the staffers are. The staffers are like holy dang! That water was blue and he turned it green! Did he do that, right? What`s the trick? Wait! Look at the staffers. Oh, wait! This happened at 4:30 a.m. this morning on the floor of the United States Senate. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island doing a real life science experiment showing PH and carbon dioxide and acidification. Why not? They had time. Sheldon White House and other Democratic senators last night, they pulled an all-nighter, another all-nighter in the U.S. Senate. Democrats holding the floor all night long last night, trying to stop more to this case actually to slow down the confirmation vote on the new head of the EPA. And while they were at it, while Senator Whitehouse was showing off his mad beaker skills, well done, Senator – while that was happening, a not insignificant number of EPA employees were hard at work all night, calling up the U.S. Capitol begging senators to please vote against Scott Pruitt to head the EPA today, which is a remarkable thing for current employees of an agency to do but they did that to try to stop Scott Pruitt. Democrats have opposed the Pruitt nomination for EPA since day one. Yesterday, though, it suddenly, became a race against the clock because a federal judge late in the day ordered Scott Pruitt to start turning over a whole bunch of documents. A federal judge yesterday in Oklahoma ordered Scott Pruitt to start turning over thousands of pages of correspondence between his office and oil and gas companies from the time when he`s been attorney general of Oklahoma. That court order came down yesterday, less than 24 hours before the Senate was scheduled to vote on him to be the head of the EPA. Because of that, Senate Democrats tried to postpone the confirmation vote, right? Postpone it at least until everybody can look at these documents that the court has just ordered to be disclosed. So, wait until everybody can look and see what Scott Pruitt said to the oil and gas companies that he`s been illegally trying to keep secret for two years. Can`t we just wait until we see those documents since they`re about to come out? Senate Republicans said no. No, we`re not waiting. So, after that long night with the 4:30 a.m. science experiment and the court order and the all-nighter, Senate Republicans nevertheless called the vote on Scott Pruitt and then something funny happened in the vote. Watch this. They`re taking the roll call. They`re taking the roll call. They do it alphabetically, so all the senators are voting. They`re in the first part of the alphabet. Senator Al Franken is getting ready to cast his vote and then just watch him here. We put a spot shadow around him. Watch this.",1,2772.0,486.0,host,22.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-17

He`s spent his whole professional career deriding the EPA and suing the EPA. Now, as of today, he is in charge of it. But you know what? Interesting thing here, we`re still going to get those e-mails. Scott Pruitt is still subject to that court order. He still really does have to hand other hundreds of those e-mails between his office and oil and gas companies, has to hand over hundreds of them by Tuesday, has to hand over thousands more over the next ten days. For whatever reason, he has been illegally withholding those thousands of e-mails that document his relationship and his communications with the oil and gas industry which, of course, he`ll now be dealing with directly as our new EPA administrator. And so, yes, Scott Pruitt is taking over as head of the EPA but that means Scott Pruitt will start his brand new job at the EPA with his first big scandal already waiting for him when he walks in the door.

25,MADDOW," Do you get President`s Day off? We don`t. But a lot of people do. Congress does. In fact, Congress is taking not just President`s Day on Monday, they`re taking president`s week. This is what they call district days, they`re taking the whole week off next week to go home to their constituents, check in with the district. And you know what? Just in time, because back home they have been sorely missed. Look at this, spotted in Beechwold, Ohio. Concern citizens in Beechwold are searching for their missing congressman, Pat Tiberi. Where is Tiberi? Same thing in Dayton, Ohio. Have you seen Representative Mike Turner? If seen, please return to his district. Not seen since election when he needed our votes. In California, Congressman Darrell Issa`s constituents took out a big full page ad in his local paper inviting him, please, to attend an emergency town hall on health care they have gone through the trouble of setting up for him in his district, when he`s off and home for Washington next week. It says at the top of ad, paid for by a crowdfunding effort from 165 constituents of Darrell Issa`s 49th district. The ad has this personal note from a woman who says she`s a 67-year-old single working grandmother who lives in Darrell`s district. She just says before the Affordable Care Act, she had been uninsured for 24 years. Now, she has insurance because of the Affordable Care Act, she is worried about herself, she`s worried about her grand kids` future if her health care gets taken away. She puts her picture on the ad. She signs it by name and then below her name there`s 200 other people in Congressman Darrell Issa`s district and, again, full-page ad in his local paper. They end it by inviting others to join them. Quote, “Would you like to add your time the petition? Would you like to call Representative Issa and ask him to come to the town hall?” And they give the phone number so other people can invite their congressman, too. So far, Darrell Issa`s office says no way. There`s no way, he is not going to meet with his constituents next week when he is home in his district. But I think they are going to keep asking. Meanwhile, in Idaho – Idaho – about 50 of Senator Jim Risch`s constituents piled into his constituent post office back home in Idaho this week.

Do you feel like your work on this may have led to this town hall that he`s called?",1,272.0,51.0,host,44.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-17
44,BURNETTE," I definitely think that it`s helped get out the word that you need to meet with the people of South Carolina. You know, we`ve been – over the past month, we`ve been trying to get in contact with both of them and have pretty much been ignored from the state of South Carolina. Several groups have been formed in this Indivisible Group throughout the state of South Carolina. We`ve been contacting his offices. We – he`s got three offices in this state. People have gone to all three offices of Senator Scott and Senator Graham. And we`ve e-mailed, we`ve made phone calls and pretty much we get nothing. And then I created the petition online and had about the 4,000 signatures and we get the e-mail today that he`s going to have a town hall meeting tomorrow which really isn`t his own town hall, it`s Mark Sanford`s town hall and he`s kind of piggybacking on that.",1,864.0,157.0,guest,45.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-17

46,BURNETTE," Well, I`m not going to be able to make it unfortunately. That`s about a four-hour drive from me, from my home. My daughter – I`m a mother to an eight-year-old daughter and she has a volleyball tournament tomorrow. And so that takes precedence over that fortunately.",1,266.0,47.0,guest,47.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-17
47,MADDOW," Good for you. I was that kid with the volleyball tournament and I need my mom there. So, I hear you. Let me just – you know, a lot of the discussion around people trying to get town halls with their senators and members of Congress next week. A lot of discussion about people trying to make contact with their members of Congress right now. Members have said these are paid protesters. These are organized left wing group. They`re out-of-state people. Clearly, you`re none of those things. I wonder if you could just tell me -- tell us why you decided to get involved this way. What sort of led you to this activism? I saw you saying in that news report that you voted for both Senator Scott and Senator Graham.",1,712.0,133.0,host,48.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-17
48,BURNETTE," I sure did. Yes, I`m definitely not a paid protester. By day, I`m an elementary schoolteacher and I – any passion is education. That`s what matters to me. You know, one of my favorite quotes is by Martin Luther King, Jr., the day we become silent about the things that matter is the day that our lives end. And so, education, it matters to me and I can`t be silent anymore. But other people across the state, health care matters to them. Gun control matters to them. Everybody has issues that matter to them and the state of South Carolina cannot be silent anymore. You know, 68 percent of our South Carolina people voted in the last election. That`s high turnout, I believe. We`re politically active in the state of South Carolina and so, we`ve got to become more involved in our state, and, you know, I just started reaching out to our senators plain and simple and something is obviously working.",1,900.0,163.0,guest,49.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-17

Well, Tara Burnette from South Carolina whose petition for this town hall as got over 4,000 signatures and now, there`s a town hall even if it is all the way on the other side of the state tomorrow.

52,MADDOW," We`ve been reporting over the past couple of weeks about not just the deportations and roundups of immigrants in cities around the country, but also on the community response, when those roundups have happened, people turned out to try to support and even shield immigrants when federal authorities have come for them. A couple of nights ago, we talked with the group organizing the Here to Stay pledge. The Group United We Dream asking people who said they will support immigrants and support refugees against the Trump station, asking people who feel that way to put their money where their mouth is, to pledge that they will bodily show up and defend people. They will show support. They will be there when round-ups and raids and deportations happen. The Here We Stand people tell us, right now, as of tonight, that over 30,000 people have signed up and taken that Here We Stand pledge, that they will physically show up for immigrants in their communities. But tonight, here`s something else. This is not Here We Stand exactly but it`s kind of the same idea. These people met tonight in Baltimore, Maryland, for what they`re calling bystander training. These are people who have agreed they want to be trained to support immigrants during federal raids and enforcement. The croup hosting tonight is called Casa. They only tell us that they only came out with this idea for this training two days ago. They only announced this training two days ago. But look at this, tonight, it`s packed on a Friday night, bystander training to stand with immigrants in the face of federal raids in Baltimore tonight. There`s a lot going on in our country right now. The presidency has obviously changed radically and fast. But you know what?

53,MADDOW," Stigmonizing. This regulation unfairly stigmonizes. That was Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa this week on the floor of the Senate. That bill, the stigmonizing bill he`s talking about was one we had reported on for the last week or so. House Republicans` bill to make it easier for people who are seriously mentally ill to buy guns. Senator Grassley sponsored the Senate version of this bill. This really is a free standing, purpose-written bill that says that people who are so mentally ill that they legally and officially cannot manage their own affairs, those people should be able to buy guns. And that is, forgive me, nuts. If only because even people like Chuck Grassley used to admit this is the opposite of what we should be doing.",1,750.0,130.0,host,54.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-17
54,GRASSLEY," The biggest problem we have to deal with and quite frankly I don`t think any of us have an answer to the mental health issue. How do you get more people that have mental health problems that shouldn`t have guns, and under present law can get guns, but you got to their name into the database as well. Passing more laws banning guns isn`t going to solve the problem of a mass killing. We got to look at the bigger picture as well and then you get back to this mental health issue.",1,480.0,94.0,guest,55.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-17
55,MADDOW," Senator Chuck Grassley in 2013 calling mental health issues the biggest problem we have to deal with when it comes to guns. It`s not guns that are the problem. It`s mentally ill people that have guns. That was we – that was the Chuck Grassley approach to gun control. That was his sane approach to gun control in 2013. He has apparently changed his ever loving mind. This week he voted yes to improve his access to guns for people who the government says are seriously mentally ill. So did the majority of the U.S. Senate. The bill passes Senate 57-43. It`s now sitting on the president`s desk for him to sign or veto. Think he`ll sign it? Republicans started the year saying they`re going to use their new power in D.C. to roll back as much as President Obama`s agenda as they could. We now know one of their first priorities for that, you know, at least is rolling back some stuff that Obama did that presumably some of them agreed with, like presumably not giving guns to people who are seriously mentally ill. But now that they`ve got a change to get rid of that, that`s what they`re prioritizing. Now that they`re fully in charge, that`s what they`re working on. That does it for us tonight. We will see you again Monday. Now, it`s time for “THE LAST WORD”. Ari Melber sitting in for Lawrence O`Donnell tonight.

0,"RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST"," And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. All right. It was April 29th, 2014. And he tried to get up off the gurney in the middle of it. His name was Clayton Lockett. They were trying to kill him, but they really just could not figure it out. They couldn`t get it done. They made more than a dozen tries inserting IV lines into him, more than a dozen tries, including into his arms, into his legs, into his groin. And the whole time, he was supposed to be knocked out. He was supposed to be unconscious. But he was not unconscious. He was awake. He was writhing, arching his back, talking about how much everything hurt. And it just went on and on and on. It went on for ten minutes, and then 20 minutes, and then 30 minutes and then 40 minutes. He, actually, at one point, ended up try to help them, trying to help them kill him. He tried to help them get the needles into himself because they made these more than a dozen tries and nothing was working to knock him out. Finally, it went on for so long prison officials who are overseeing the execution, they pulled the curtain so the witnesses couldn`t see anymore of what was going on. And soon after that, they actually decided they couldn`t go ahead with it. Not that they felt bad and they didn`t want to keep trying to do it, but they literally believed that they could not do it. They had messed up their chance. It wasn`t working. They couldn`t figure it out. They called the governor. She was at a basketball game at the time, but she heard them out from the prison and told them, OK, if they felt like they couldn`t complete the execution, they should call it off. The state would stop the execution in the middle of it. They would stop trying to kill him. So, they started to make preparations to bring Clayton Lockett back. They started making preparations to try to revive him after spending all this time trying to kill him, but by then he was groaning and then he was convulsing and then he was in and out of consciousness. And then, finally, after 43 minutes, including them trying to call it off in the middle of it, and trying to bring him back, after 43 minutes he finally died of a heart attack. That was April, 2014. Just botched, right? The idea basically, I mean, whatever you think about the death penalty, this is not the way it`s supposed to go. I mean, you`re supposed to be rendered unconscious and then they kill you in our sleep. This was the opposite of that. Oklahoma just absolutely blew it. And the drug they were using to try to kill him is a drug that Oklahoma had never tried to use before and we learned the execution team, the people who are actually sticking him with the needles, the medical people and corrections people, people on the team trying to carry out this execution, they didn`t know anything about this new drug. They`d never used it before obviously. They didn`t know anything about how it was supposed to work, how it might be different than other drugs. They`d never trained on it, been briefed on it. And that Clayton Lockett execution ended up making national headlines because of how brutal and botched and bloody it was because it went on for so long, because the witnesses saw so much of what happened and it was so disturbing. But it wasn`t until months after it happened that we found out what went wrong there. And we found out specifically how Oklahoma ended up getting that drug and why they got that drug. It turns out in part it was because of this guy. Recognize him? This little bloody chapter in modern American history is not what this man is famous for but it`s part of his record. Let me explain. Back in 2014, after the – this execution went so wrong, investigative reporters at “The Tulsa World” newspaper, they were able to figure out mostly through court documents but also through their own digging that the state in that execution, they hadn`t followed their own laws and protocols about how an execution like that is supposed to work. I mean, what happened in that particular execution is the state apparently realized sort of belatedly, oops, that they didn`t have drugs on hand for this next execution that they wanted to do and when they figured that out, rather than stopping the process, raising it up the chain of command, maybe delaying the executions a little longer in order to figure out how they were going to handle that serious roadblock to what they wanted to do. Instead of that, they decided, no, we have to do these executions. Now, we`re not going to delay them. We`ve been under a lot of scrutiny. We`re going for them and they scrambled. We`ll figure out the drugs. And specifically, it was lawyers from the general counsel`s office and the corrections department and lawyers from the attorney`s general office. Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of that state, his office and the top lawyer at the Corrections Department, they decided with this execution date bearing down on them, they decided that they were basically going to freelance. They`re going to figure it out. Never mind the protocol, never mind the rules. They tried to figure it out themselves. Lawyers from Scott Pruitt`s office and the general counsel`s office and the corrections department, they personally got online and they said they just started browsing around. The general counsel later explained in a court filing that he and Scott Pruitt`s office, they started basically, randomly looking around online to see if they could figure out how long it takes for various drugs to kill people. Now, remember, these are lawyers. These are not medical professionals of any kind who have any expertise on this matter. And when the lawyers were asked where they got the information that they found about how long various drugs take to kill people, I want to read you literally the actual quote in the deposition and the answer to that question was this, quote, “On WikiLeaks or whatever. I did my own research, I looked online. You know, what passed the key, WikiLeaks, WikiLeaks or whatever it is.” That`s where they say they found the information that led them to pick the drugs that they picked, that were then used for the first time in that state on Clayton Lockett. They found it on WikiLeaks or whatever. They looked around online. The attorney general of the state is not supposed to be involved in a process like that. Picking the actual drugs, that is not the attorney general`s purview. Nobody in the attorney general`s office is even expected to have any expertise for doing anything like that and the rules and protocols in the state don`t say that the attorney general should do anything like that. And the attorney general, Scott Pruitt, he denied up and down for a long time that he or his office had anything to do with that process. No, we didn`t have anything to do with picking those drugs. Why would anybody even say that? Obviously, that`s not in the rules, why would we do it? But you know what? There was an investigation. Multiple sources, multiple other actors, multiple other state officials involved in that terribly botched process of killing that guy in 2014, multiple people said despite your denials, Scott Pruitt, yes, you were involved in this. The Department of Public Safety in Oklahoma did an investigation into the botched execution. And the director of the corrections department confirmed that a lethal drug in that execution were not chosen, according to the protocol designed by the state. They weren`t. They`re picked by the lawyers. He said, quote, “The previous general counsel and the attorney general`s office that`s who chose the drugs. That general counsel who was himself involved in searching the WikiLeaks or whatever, for the drug information, along with Scott Pruitt`s office. He later explained how it was that he and these other lawyers ended up in that weird position which they were never supposed to be in. He told investigators that basically was political. He told investigators that the state was under pressure to carry out that execution that night, particularly because it was supposed to be a very exciting double header. That night, it was going to be Clayton Lockett then they had another guy standing by who they were going to kill with the same drugs right after Clayton Lockett. They were going to do two in one night. A lot of attention for something like that. Quote, “The attorney general`s office being an elected office was under a lot of pressure. The staff over there was under a lot of pressure to say get it done, you know? And so, yeah, yeah, I think it was a joint decision but there was. I`ve got to say there was a push to make the decision, get it done, hurry up about it.” Get it done, hurry up about it. That was from the attorney general`s office, because it`s an elected office. He`s an ambitious guy in that office, and they wanted to get those guys killed, get this thing over with. Right? Who cares what the drug is? Who cares if we`ve never used that drug before, I looked something up on the WikiLeaks or whatever. You got yourself a smartphone, right? We`ll use something we have never tried before, who cares, get it done. And that is how Scott Pruitt apparently ended up making the decision about a brand new experiment method that Oklahoma was going to try out on its prisoners that led to 43 minutes of Clayton Lockett writhing and talking and trying to get the needle in himself and them trying to call off the execution in the middle of it and him trying to get off the gurney before finally three quarters of an hour into it, it was finally a heart attack that killed him. Publicly, Scott Pruitt denied up and down that he had anything to do with that, that his office worked on that in any way. The state investigation proved that he was lying when he issued those denials. It was around that time that that investigation became publicly known Scott Pruitt got famous for something else. He in fact made the front page of the “New York Times,” it was an investigative piece by Eric Lipton at the “New York Times” that won Lipton the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting in 2014. Eric Lipton discovered that what Scott Pruitt was doing on environmental issues in Oklahoma is that he was taking letters and documents written by oil and gas companies that were big campaign contributors to him and he was literally copying and pasting the full text of the documents that they wrote, the letters that they wrote. He was copying and pasting those things from oil and gas companies on to his own letterhead intact as if they were his own work, and then he was sending those things to Washington as if they were the views of the state of Oklahoma. And mostly those letters were, like berating the EPA about something or another. Well, now, Scott Pruitt is who the Trump administration has chosen to run the EPA for the country. And the vote on his nomination is supposed to be tomorrow. But despite all of that stuff, which is known about Scott Pruitt and a lot else besides, his vote is scheduled tomorrow and it looks like the wrench in the works on Scott Pruitt, if there is going to be one, is a wrench in the works that a judge in Oklahoma threw tonight. Tonight, a judge in Oklahoma threw a wrench in the works for the Scott Pruitt nomination because there`s actually something else that Scott Pruitt was starting to get famous for in Oklahoma. For the last two years, he has been refusing to answer public records requests sent to his office in Oklahoma. He`s the attorney general of the state. He`s subject to the same transparency rules and freedom of information rules as every other part of the state government. But for the last two years Scott Pruitt has inexplicably been rejecting public records requests for documents and correspondents between his office and oil and gas companies. There`s no legal basis for him resisting or rejecting these records requests. He`s just been saying no. And tonight, a federal judge in Oklahoma proclaimed, quote, “There really is no reasonable explanation why his office hasn`t complied with public records requests.” She described his actions as a, quote, “abject failure to follow the law.” And this judge in Oklahoma tonight ordered him – he`s finally got to do it, he`s got to hand over what`s expected to be about 3,000 pages of e-mails and other types of communications and correspondence between his office and the oil and gas companies that have been taking such good care of him all of these years in Oklahoma. Wow. Right? So, we`re finally, finally going to see that stuff from Scott Pruitt`s office from his time as attorney general which is his current job. The judge says he has to produce this stuff, make it publicly available by Tuesday. Oh, but wait. His vote to be the head of the EPA is tomorrow. Hmm. Democrats were not psyched about the Scott Pruitt EPA nomination anyway, at least most Democrats. But now it would seem that both Democrats and Republicans might have good reason to just wait a few more days before they vote on him since some time between now and Tuesday, we`re going to get 3,000 pages of his communications with oil and gas companies, 3,000 pages of communications with oil and gas companies that he has been illegally withholding from public view for the last two years. That kind of seems like stuff you might want to see before you vote on this guy to be in charge of great swathes of public policy that affect oil and gas companies, right? I mean, whether you`re a Democrat or Republican, you would at least want to see this stuff before you vote, wouldn`t you? Especially if you only have to wait a few days, wouldn`t, wouldn`t? When the new president picked Michael Flynn to be his national security advisor, he also announced one of the deputy national security advisors he wanted, that would be a woman named Monica Crowley. She was a FOX News personality. Not long after her name was announced it emerged her last book was substantially plagiarized and then her publisher yanked the book and it was reported a bunch of her newspaper columns were also plagiarized, then it was reported that, ooh, her PhD thesis is also substantially plagiarized. And at that point, Monica Crowley got yanked as a deputy national security advisor. They had to pull her name. The first person who the new president picked to be secretary of the army was a billionaire finance guy who had been a Trump donor. Shortly after his nomination was announced to lead the Army, it emerged he has been written up in a police report for punching a guy out. Not all that long ago at a fancy horse auction in New York state. And then he, too, Vincent viola, got his name yanked as secretary of the army. Earlier this week, the shortest national security advisor tenure in American history came to an end at a record 24 days after Michael Flynn was fired, resigned, fired, resigned in the midst of an ongoing and now increasingly serious scandal about his prolific contacts with the Russian government before he became national security advisor and even before the election during the campaign. The beltway story about Michael Flynn`s firing has mostly focused on the fact that he lied about his contacts with the Russian government to people in the White House. But, you know what? Maybe that`s not the biggest deal here. “The Washington Post” reports tonight that he may have lied about those contacts with the Russian government to the FBI. And that`s a very serious thing, indeed, because that`s a felony. I mean, remember the back story here is that there are transcripts and recordings of Michael Flynn`s contacts with Russian officials because the U.S. government monitors the communications of Russian officials and it is reportedly clear in those recordings that Michael Flynn was talking to the Russian government about the sanctions the Obama administration had levied against Russia as punishment for them interfering in our presidential election. Again, “The Washington Post” reporting tonight that even though it`s clear in the recordings and the transcripts that that subject, the sanctions subject was discussed in those calls, “The Washington Post” reports tonight that Flynn nevertheless denied to the FBI that he had ever discussed those matters with the Russians. They`ve got him on the transcripts talking about it and then he told them in person he didn`t. If he lied to the FBI, that would be a felony. If it were prosecuted, he could be looking at serious jail time. That said, the decision about whether or not to prosecute him would be made by the Justice Department which, of course, is now headed up by the man who is chairman of our National Security Advisory Committee on the Trump campaign, Jeff Sessions. He`s now under increasing scrutiny over the fact that he refuses to recuse himself from many investigations of the campaign that he was a part of. Raise your hand if you think Jeff Sessions is going to prosecute mike Flynn for lying to the FBI? No, raise your hand. I can`t – The day after the Michael Flynn resignation this week, the Trump administration also had to pull its labor secretary nominee Andy Puzder. And now, tonight, we`ve learned that the man who the White House wanted to replace Michael Flynn as national security advisor, he has told the White House, no, he won`t take the job. “The Financial Times” quotes a person with firsthand knowledge of the discussions between President Trump and Admiral Robert Harward as saying, quote, “Harward is conflicted between the call of duty and the obvious dysfunctionality.” Let`s keep going. Tonight, Senate Democrats are planning to hold the floor all night long in opposition to the vote tomorrow on Scott Pruitt to head up the EPA. Not because of just their objections to him but now the fact that within a matter of five days, 3,000 pages of documentation that his office was illegally withholding about communications between him and oil and gas companies, those are about to be released. How can the Republicans possibly defend voting on him tomorrow when some time in the next five days, we`re getting a 3,000 page document dump on him on exactly the subject he`s now being elevated to the federal government to oversee. So, the president today held a press conference in which he proclaimed that he`s just mystified anybody thinks anything`s going wrong.",1,18353.0,3232.0,host,1.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-16

2,MADDOW," The personnel debacles and the serious scandals that already attend to this less than one-month-old presidency are really – without hyperbole, they are unlike anything we have ever seen at the start of a presidential term and that`s completely leaving aside the issue of policy. I mean, there has been no significant legislation passed since this president has been in office. He has signed into law zero major policies, the only exception to that is his Muslim ban and refugee ban which he signed as an executive order at the end of January. Well, today as the president proclaimed how finely tune his machine is, as he crowed about how perfectly everything has rolled out thus far, including that Muslim ban, today that, too, his first policy initiative, that today completely fell apart. Administration lawyers as he was wrapping up that press conference they were writing to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals asking that court to please vacate its previous ruling striking down the ban as unconstitutional or at least, forgive me, upholding a stay on it on those grounds. The reason the administration asked the court to vacate their previous ruling is because, quote, “the president intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new substantially revised executive order.” This is the one substantial policy they have tried to enact in this first disastrous four weeks of his administration. This is the one policy they have tried to enact. And today, he was forced to take it back and try to start over. I mean, nobody wants to see the United States of America fail. But if you want to know what it looks like when a president fails in every conceivable way, in every conceivable measure, this is what it looks like when a president fails in every way.",1,1789.0,310.0,host,3.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-16
3,MADDOW," You know even as a non-lawyer, you might have a chance of explaining it when the ruling from the court fits on one page and it`s double spaced and there`s still room at the bottom. We have some breaking news. We have new news about the president`s Muslim ban and refugee ban. I mentioned at the top of the shower, lawyers for the president today told the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that the president intends to take back his travel ban and try again. Well, we now have the court`s response. Again, this is breaking news. This just came in just a moment ago. And as far as I read it this amounts to the court saying “fine by us.” The ruling says the administration will inform the court of any new developments, but I think this means there is will be no new hearing at the ninth circuit, no en banc full court hearing because the administration is rescinding its travel ban. They are basically conceding they lost on this. At least that`s how I read it but not a lawyer. Let`s ask somebody who is better positioned to understand this. Joining us now is Bob Ferguson. He`s Washington state attorney general. He brought this case in the first place. Mr. Attorney General, thank you for your time tonight.",1,1208.0,222.0,host,4.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-16

5,MADDOW," So, they`ve pulled the ban, they`ve rescinded it, they say they`re going to try again. To me, as a sort of lay observer of this, this looks to me like you won here. Like you`ve beat them and you`ve made them concede they lost. Is that how you see it?",1,251.0,51.0,host,6.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-16
6,FERGUSON," Without any question. The administration, the president is conceding. They filed that brief today as you read, saying the president was going to rescind the executive order. They did not want to seek review from the Ninth Circuit or the U.S. Supreme Court because they knew what`s become increasing obvious. It would just be one more defeat on top of multiple defeats they`ve already – they`ve already suffered.",1,412.0,69.0,guest,7.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-16
7,MADDOW," So they could – when the president responded to the Ninth Circuit, those three judges, their decision a few days ago, when the president said, “See you in court”, everybody read that bluster from the president as seeing he would appeal to a wider panel of the Ninth Circuit, he wanted a bigger group of judges to be hearing it, or that he would go straight to the Supreme Court. In essence, the administration has decided – no, neither, we`re going to go back to the drawing board entirely. This law is dead now.",1,513.0,95.0,host,8.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-16
8,FERGUSON," I would agree. Once it`s rescinded, it`s going to be rescinded. By the way, the president had a third option after his “see you in court” tweet. Back before the trial court judge, there was a hearing in which we said, we`re ready to move forward on the merits and the administration said, no, no, we don`t want to move forward on the merits, either. So, frankly, immediately after the tweet, we`ll see you in court, the Department of Justice and the administration and everything they could to avoid seeing frankly anybody in court, because they knew they would lose.",1,568.0,101.0,guest,9.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-16
9,MADDOW, They do say that they`re going to rewrite this thing. That they`re going to try again. They`re going to come up with a new one. What do you expect from them on that? And do you feel like there is a way for them to more constitutionally craft the same kind of intention that was evident in the first try at this?,1,312.0,63.0,host,10.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-16
10,FERGUSON," Well, frankly I`m glad they`re going to take another shot at this. We`ve been saying from day one they should tear up the original executive order and try again. It`s hard to pre-judge what that`s going to look like without seeing it, Rachel, obviously. But what I can`t say is that it is still our belief, of course, that no one is above the law or above the Constitution. That includes the president and my team will carefully scrutinize line by line, word by word any new executive order that this administration puts forward.",1,530.0,95.0,guest,11.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-16
11,MADDOW," Mr. Attorney General, let me ask you one last question. We`ve talked about this a number of times since you filed this challenge. I never asked you about the politics of this. Obviously, you represent Washington state. You`re the attorney general in that state. It is a legal decision but to a certain degree a political decision, a statement of values for the state to do this. Has this been a controversial decision in your state? Do you feel like you`ve felt sort of political blowback of any kind or, contrarily, political support for doing this? Ultimately, you and Minnesota bringing there case is what seems to have stopped it in its track. What`s the reaction about that from your constituents?",1,703.0,122.0,host,12.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-16
12,FERGUSON," You know, it`s interesting. I proposed recently repealing the death penalty in our state and banning the sale of assault weapons. On issues like that, I received an amount of blowback, as you might imagine, even in a blue state like Washington. But to be candid, Rachel, on this issue it`s been frankly nothing but positive feedback as we walk down the street with my solicitor general, Noah Purcell. We can`t get more than a block without people rolling down their car windows saying, “Hey, way to go, keep it up” or stopping us on the street. So, frankly, it`s been really affirming that people believe in the rule of law, that no one is above the law, even the president, and we`re going to hold them to the Constitution. And so, it`s really been a positive experience. I`m very proud of my team who`s worked literally around the clock, Rachel, to get to this really fantastic result.",1,888.0,159.0,guest,13.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-16

15,MADDOW," You know, we all – we knew one of the things that we knew was going to happen was that blue states were going to fight legal battles against this administration. We didn`t necessarily know who was going to be tip of the spear and who is going to have the most success. But this case brought by Washington state and Minnesota, this absolutely cut the Trump administration off at their knees. The first and only policy of any significant size they have tried is this travel ban and those states just stopped them. It`s dead. Much more ahead. Busy night.

That`s our next story. But we also have a cliffhanger story last night right here on this show at the very end of the show. It ended as a mystery. We got lots of feedback about it last night because it was a what`s going to happen story? Now, it has found a very surprising ending, and that means – I`m going to need music, it`s a dramatic story, it has a sound track, it has a dramatic ending. Our cliffhanger will be revolved.

17,MADDOW," In 2004, George W. Bush was reelected and things looked really gloomy for the Democrats. But then things turned around fast. 2004, Bush was reelected, 2006, Democrats took the House and Senate. 2008, which you remember most for Barack Obama winning the presidency, that year, Democrats also piled up more wins in Congress on top of what they had already won in 2006. That `06/`08 double whammy was huge for the Democrats. But then it turned around on them really fast. Barely a month into the Obama presidency, the Tea Party movement started springing up around the country. The initial anti-Obama anti-Democrat Tea Party rallies were actually held in February, 2009, literally the month after Obama was inaugurated. Then, there were anti-Obama, anti-Democrat Tea Party rallies nationwide on Tax Day, April 15th, 2009, and on through the summer and into the hall of that year. And at the time, Barack Obama was a really popular president. He won that election in `08 convincingly. He had huge majorities in Washington, his polling numbers were pretty good. But that protest movement, that bottled up frustrated conservative energy, that was soon put to very specific electoral use. They got their first big chance of turning their new protest movement into really political results – ironically, in the most stereo typically blue state in the country, Massachusetts. I love this old truck. It`s brought me closer to the people of this state.",1,1442.0,239.0,host,18.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-16
18,MADDOW," Scott Brown and his truck. Scott Brown, a previously obscure state senator with no major accomplishments of any kind. Really, he had never done anything of note, even though he was very handsome and he had been a model and he got a lot of press for that. But after Senator Ted Kennedy died, Scott Brown, this very unlikely candidate, he ran as the Republican candidate in the special election for that Senate seat. No Republican had won a Senate seat in Massachusetts for almost 40 years. But that was 2010, not a normal year in politics. It was the year that wave of Tea Party energy and Scott Brown of all people, he won in Massachusetts and that shock upset victory was the first indicator of what was on the way for Republicans and Democrats. Scott Brown was first, he won that forever blue Senate seat in January, 2010. And later that year in November, 2010, that was the wipeout for Democrats. Democrats lost 63 seats in the House. They lost six seats in the Senate, canceled out all the gains of the previous four years. President Obama called it a shellacking. Well, now we`re on the same kind of spot on the political timeline. Now, there`s another brand new president. But this time, President Trump is far less popular than President Obama was at this time. He`s also facing an unprecedented level of serious scandal early in his administration and he`s also facing a grassroots protest movement against him just like President Obama did with the Tea Party folks, but already the on-the-ground movement against Trump is larger than the Tea Party ever was, even at its height. Anti-Trump protests started the day of his inauguration. They got huge one day after the inauguration, possibly the biggest protest day in U.S. history. And now almost four weeks into his time in office, the protests are not just continuing, they are spreading. Hello Providence, Rhode Island town hall meeting with members of Congress this week. Eight hundred people in Rhode Island yelling “just say no.” as in just say no to everything from this president. This was a crowded scene inside the office of Congressman Eric Paulson of Minnesota. This is his home district office in Minnesota, he`s a Republican congressman, look at the people who want to talk to his staffers. In Orlando this week, this was Marco Rubio`s constituent office, people demanding that he stand up to President Trump on something, anything. Wilmington, North Carolina, a similar crowd with a similar message gathered outside the office of North Carolina Republican Senator Richard Burr. In Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, last weekend, so many people showed up for a grassroots meeting to oppose Trump and his agenda that half of the 250 people who showed up had to sit outside and have a parallel meeting. They had to meet inside and outside at the same time. This is inside Ohio Congressman Pat Teabury`s office in Columbus, Ohio. This guy on the right is inviting the congressman to a town hall on the Affordable Care Act. His constituents have set up a time and a location. All they need is their congressman. Look at the staffer, how he`s scowling at the guy. “He is not coming to that town hall.” Here`s a picture of an organizing group in New Jersey. They say this was their first meeting one month ago. You can see there, it`s already pretty big. They just this week posted same meeting room, same group, what it looks like this week. They`re growing. Last night, over 400 people turned out for the first Indivisible organizing meeting in Yolo County, California, in all places. That`s Yolo County. This movement, this protest movement against Trump is showing signs that it is not just big, it`s sustainable, it`s growing. The question is whether Democrats – well, one question about it is whether Democrats can turn that energy, can turn that movement into nuts and bolts political gains, whether they can turn it into electoral gains the way Republicans did starting with the Tea Party wave and old Scott Brown in 2010. The first big test of that is about to happen like next week. It`s a fascinating story. That`s next. Stay with us.",1,4108.0,714.0,host,19.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-16
19,MADDOW," Democrats lost an election this week in Minnesota and they`re super excited about it. It was a special election to fill an open state rep seat in a Minnesota House district, 32B. It was a seat that was previously held by a Republican and a Republican again won the seat this week. Here`s why Democrats are psyched about losing that race, though. When Minnesota`s House district 32B voted in November, Donald Trump won by nearly 30 points in that district. This week, they voted for their Republican candidate for state rep there. She didn`t win by 30 points like Donald Trump did, she only won by six. If you`re a Democrat, that`s called hope. That`s called progress. And now`s the time the Democrats are starting to wonder around the country, can they close the gap? Does this terrible public view of the new president and these protests in the streets and this organizing energy on the center and left, can they bottle it to boost chances of electing Democrats across the country? Take Delaware, for example. Current makeup of Delaware Senate is 10 Republicans, 10 Democrats and one to be determined. Democrats have controlled the Delaware Senate for, like, 40 years, but now, the future of the control of that body rests on the shoulders of this woman, her name is Stephanie Hanson. She`s the Democrat running in the special election for that one open seat in the Delaware Senate. The voting is a week from Saturday. Look who showed up to support her this week. Oh, Joe Biden. Oh, yes, pride of Delaware, former vice president showed up to this little state Senate campaign event Monday night this week to help her, to try to save his party`s majority in that state`s Senate. That`s next Saturday that race. And three days after that, voters in Connecticut will get to decide who controls their state`s legislature. The Connecticut state Senate has two open seats right now. Republicans are making a very, very, very hard play. Democrats are going to have to play hard, too, if they want to win that one or beat back the Republicans. So, Democrats have got opportunities here. They also have got to play hard if they`re going to gain or even retain control in these states. For more on that, see Georgia. Tuesday night, we reported on the special election for a congressional seat coming up in Georgia. It`s the race to replace Republican Tom Price who has left to be part of the cabinet, to go be house secretary. Republicans have held the Tom Price congressional seat forever but that district only went for Donald Trump by 1 1/2 points in November and I should mention there are 18 candidates running in that race as of the filing deadline yesterday. That thing is at least a little bit up for grabs, which is why, I thought it was weird, why I pointed out on Tuesday night that the Democratic Party, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee hasn`t yet sent any full time staffers to that district to work on that race. They hadn`t announced any plans to invest or make a, you know, good try in that race. Maybe that`s a pickup opportunity. Trump barely won in that district. I should tell you that the DCCC was super mad at us for that segment, for pointing that out. They reached out firmly to say they have been helping that race, but in less obvious ways. Now, that the field is set, though, look fund-raising e-mail from the DCCC specifically from that Georgia sixth district race with all some caps bold urgency, “Breaking news, Georgia special election spells trouble for Trump and Republicans.” I can also tell you tonight, I can report exclusively that the DCCC is investing in a team of field organizers for the Georgia Democrats starting next week. They`re going to split the cost of district specific research for that race as well. So, the Democrats are jumping in. And, boy, were they mad when I said they weren`t. So, that`s something. I`m looking for signs of life where I can see them. But this race on the Democratic side, it has been taking shape for a while. Even before the field was set last night, and the DCCC made this big jump, one of the Democrats in this race, 29-year-old John Ossoff, he`s already received a ton of grassroots and monetary support, particularly organized by the folks at the liberal blog Daily Kos, sort of the mother of all liberal blogs. In 2012, Kos backed Elizabeth Warren`s Senate campaign. They raised a half million dollars for her to take back that U.S. Senate seat from Scott Brown in Massachusetts. When it came time to fill Tom Price`s open seat in Georgia, Daily Kos was Johnny on the spot on this race and on this candidate. They threw their support behind Ossoff very early on, right after Congressman John Lewis endorsed him. So far, they`ve raised over three quarters of a million dollars for Ossoff, which the Ossoff campaign tells us has gone right to their bank accounts. Will this kind of thing work to flip that reliably Republican district to a Democrat? Can the Democratic Party capitalize on the efforts that have already been put forward by progressive groups, progressive blogs? Can they battle sort of magic that`s out there in terms of the public dislike of this president and this big protest movement, can they battle out to eke out a win here? Joining us now is David Nir. He`s political director for Daily Kos. He`s a publisher of Daily Kos elections. David, it`s nice to see you. Thanks for being here.",1,5395.0,952.0,host,20.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-16

24,NIR," We picked Ossoff because as you mentioned, John Lewis endorsed him. And that was a very big signal for us.

25,MADDOW," Do you think it is a winnable race? I mean, obviously, Tom Price won by huge margin when he was getting reelected there multiple times and it has been Republican for a long time.

26,NIR," That`s exactly right. It`s definitely winnable precisely because that this sort of suburban, well-educated district really did rebel against Trump. You showed that figure of him just winning by one point. And if Democrats can pull off a win here, it will send shock waves through the Republican Party because it will show Trump is really doing tremendous damage to the GOP, and if Republicans maintain their suicide pact with Trump, it means the House could be in play in 2018.",1,478.0,82.0,guest,27.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-16

34,MADDOW," Hmm. The more you know, excellent long running public service ad campaign. Love it. We have our own knockoff version. For us, it`s not the more you know. For us, it`s, you know more now. It is also intended to be a public service. Thank you, Nick. We know more now when we have a story that we left as a bit of a cliffhanger. But when you go to check on the story, it`s been resolved. Tonight, we`ve got one that resolved faster than expected. Right at the end of last night`s show, right at the buzzer, we reported on a politics story involving the Miami Marlins baseball team. The team is apparently up for sale. And the people who want to buy them are the Kushner family. That Kushner family. The efforts being led by the younger brother of Jared Kushner, who is working as a senior adviser to the president. Jared Kushner is married to the president`s daughter. He`s also advising the president now. Everybody thought that kind of thing was illegal because of federal nepotism rules but hey, apparently those rules don`t count anymore. Anyway, the Kushner family has been thinking about buying the Miami Marlins and we`ve known that for a while. But last night, the “Miami Herald” reported that the current owner of he Miami Marlins, the guy who`s considering selling the team to the White House-connected Kushner family, last night, “The Herald” reported he`s also being considered for a sweet diplomatic posting from the White House. “The Herald” reported last night he`s the leading candidate for the best ambassador job of all. He`s in line to become the American ambassador to France, which is hilarious, right? It`s like an all caps exclamation point corruption story. Do you think the Kushner family might possibly get a better deal in buying the marlins if they can throw in the ambassadorship to France as a sweetener? Would you also like part of the old executive office building named for you, sir? Maybe you`d like to be on the $50 bill? Is there anything else we can throw in? Jared`s family would really like to make this deal. So, that was the news last night as we finished the show. Bingo, moments after we reported that story, moments later, the Kushner family released a new statement on this subject. They said, quote, “Although the Kushners have made substantial progress in discussions for us to purchase the Marlins, recent reports, recent reports, suggest that Mr. Loria will soon be nominated by the president to be ambassador to France. If that is true, we do not want this unrelated transaction to complicate that process and will not pursue it.” Here`s the kicker, here`s the kicker, the best part, the kicker. Quote, “The Kushners remain interested in purchasing a team and would love to buy the Marlins at another time.” So, pencil it into your calendar. Buy Miami Marlins later. And in the meantime, enjoy your ambassadorship. Au revoir. There you have it. If you were worried that the Kushner family might get a sweetheart deal for the Marlins because the current owner wants to be the ambassador to France, and they can hook them up with that – don`t fret. Don`t fret. That`s not going to happen. Instead, they`ve decided to put the team on layaway. He can have the ambassadorship now. They`ll get the team later, once this whole thing has blown over. I`m sure the deal will be totally up and up when it goes through. But now, you know more now. Thanks, Nick. That does it for us tonight. We will see you again tomorrow. Now, it`s time for “THE LAST WORD.” Ari Melber sitting in for Lawrence tonight. Good evening, Ari.THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

0,"RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC ANCHOR"," And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. This is the P-3C Orion aircraft. It`s made by Lockheed Martin. They`ve been making it since the 1960s. It`s got four turbo-prop engines. You can see there. This is a plane that can fly really, really far. It can stay in the air for a really, really long time. The Navy says the P-3 Orion has been its, quote, “front line” land-based maritime patrol aircraft since the 1960s. They`ve got a bunch of these. And they use them all over the world. They are about $36 million each. As I said, the military has a lot of them. But it`s interesting, it`s not just the U.S. military that has a lot of them. A bunch of other militaries around the world have them, too. This is one of these American military aircraft that we are very happy to sell to friendly governments all over the world. And that is what allowed this to happen in 2014. Look carefully at that picture. Yes. That is a roof punctured by the top tail fins of a bunch of airplanes. This is 2014 in Japan. They had a really big snowstorm and there was this 60-year-old aircraft hangar and maintenance facility that had six Japanese P-3 Orions in it, and four P-3 Orions that belonged to this Navy. They had this giant snow storm. It had a flat roof on that building. The roof could not deal with the weight of the snow, the roof collapsed, the hangar collapsed and all of the planes got squished but not before their tail fins poked through the ceiling. So, yes, that was a very expensive snowstorm crushing all those planes. That same kind of plane, a P3-C Orion was on a patrol mission last Wednesday in the South China Sea when it had what the Navy is calling an unsafe encounter with a Chinese military plane. Now, this is not one of those things where they like send a little fighter jet out to do barrel rolls around our surveillance aircraft or something. The P-3 Orion that was the U.S. plane involved here but this was the Chinese plane. Look at that. This was the plane that was involved in the unsafe incident on the Chinese side, or at least it was a plane like this. This is a weird looking plane, isn`t it? It`s also a four engine turbo prop plane, sort of potbellied, like sort of sway bellied. It`s got a sharp little pug nose. And then it`s got this big thing that sticks off the top that looks like a solar panel from the `70s before we knew how to put them on right. It`s like the least aerodynamic radar array. But that was it. That was the plane involved on Wednesday of last week. That weird looking plane, or one just like it, according to the U.S. military, quote, “crossed the nose of a U.S. Navy P-3 Orion. The Pentagon says that the U.S. plane was in international air space. Again, the Orion, they say, was just on a routine patrol on the South China Sea, and this lumbering, strange looking Chinese plane that looks like a big billboard on its back crossed right in front of the Navy Orion. It came within a thousand feet of the U.S. Navy plane, according to the U.S. military. The American pilots in the Orion had to take a hard turn. They had to alter their course abruptly in order to avoid a midair collision and came within 1,000 feet. And there are a couple of weird things about this. The first, these are not the kind of planes that you expect to be involved in an incident like this, right? These are big – both of them, big lumbering surveillance aircraft that have been flying for decades. They are both turbo props, right? I mean, the Orion, again, virtually unchanged since the 1960s. That Chinese plane, that`s called a KJ-200. It`s actually a derivative of a Soviet Union aircraft from back in a previous century when we had a Soviet Union. So, these are old, big, weird lumbering planes to be involved in something that`s this close of an encounter. Another thing that`s strange about it is that we didn`t find out about it until two days after it happened. This unsafe encounter and having to take the evasive action reportedly happened on Wednesday. The Pentagon did not make any announcement until Friday. The Chinese military has still made no announcement about it at all. But if you are keeping a list of things to worry about and wonder about these days, I think it`s fair to say you can go ahead and put this on the list. And I mean, you know, keep it in context. There`s a lot going on right now. We just got a new treasury secretary tonight, Steve Mnuchin, sworn in moments ago, another Goldman Sachs guy. Oh, good. You know, his dad worked for Goldman Sachs, too. The labor secretary nominee now looks like he may be crashing and burning. He might not get confirmed at all. We`re going to have the latest on that coming up in a few minutes tonight, including the weird Oprah Winfrey part of it. The big parlor game that the beltway media is playing now, which the Trump administration appears to be delighted to play along with, is all about the question of whether the president is going to fire his National Security Adviser Mike Flynn. Whether or not you enjoy the will he or won`t he “Apprentice”-style who`s going to get fired drama that the White House is hyping here about him now, on real national security issues, on real stuff, not just talking about stuff, but real stuff, out in the world, there are some serious careening going on right now by our government. I mean, whether or not the national security adviser is going to be fired and “The Washington Post” just broke some hot new news about that within the last few minutes, we`re going to have the authors of that piece joining us in just a moment to explain this new development, whether or not Mike Flynn is going to get fired, he`s the national security adviser. He heads the National Security Council and the National Security Council still doesn`t have most of its staff. And late on Friday night, we learned that one of the senior directors in the National Security Council, somebody who Mike Flynn had brought on board to the NSC with him, has now had to leave that post, leave the National Security Council all together because he was denied his request for a security clearance. We don`t know why he was denied his request for a security clearance but he`s out. That seems like a big deal. Whether or not that is distracting to the national security adviser, whether or not it`s distracting to him to have the president of the United States dangling his potential firing for everybody else`s entertainment for days now, whether or not you`re in sort of engaged in the personality side of this, there is also national security stuff going on that does increasingly feel out of control, even wildly out of control. So, we had this incident last week with the Chinese plane and the American plane coming within 1,000 feet of each other in the South China Sea, right? This was last week. This was Wednesday. The last incident, before this one, between the U.S. military and the Chinese military in that part of the world, you might remember, it was in early December. Do you remember this, right after our presidential election, Barack Obama was still president. You might remember then-President-elect Trump decided to take a phone call from the president of Taiwan. And from China`s perspective, that`s the diplomatic equivalent of the United States, you know, throwing a drink in their face and then cursing their mother and leaving the toilet seat up, right? I mean, that`s like – it was rattling to them and a surprise. And at first, our American shock about that was that we didn`t know if our new incoming president actually understood the magnitude of what he had just done by taking this call from the president of Taiwan. We have a sort of deal with China where we don`t recognize the government of Taiwan. When he took that call, we didn`t know if he understood that. Did he just blunder into this? His initial comments about taking that call are basically, ah, what`s the big deal? President of Taiwan, she called me. She had nice things to say to me. It would have been rude for me not to answer. Eventually, they realized that wasn`t going to fly. They had to give some indication that the president knew what he was doing. And so, a few days later, they rolled out a new explanation. They rolled out a new explanation saying that the incoming president knew exactly what he was doing and actually what he was doing was just driving a very hard bargain.",1,8404.0,1530.0,host,1.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
1,"DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES", I fully understand the “One China” policy but I don`t know why we have to be bound by “One China” policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things.,1,170.0,35.0,guest,2.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
2,MADDOW," I understand it. But why do we have to be – we`ll turn it into a deal, right? That was December 11th. He`s not yet president. The incoming president, the president-elect at that time saying, “One China” policy, I don`t really plan to abide by it unless I get something for it. You can forget the cornerstone of 40 years of relationship between the United States and China. You can forget this “One China” policy so painstakingly crafted in the 1970s to allow us to have diplomatic relations with China, we`re going to throw that out of the window. That doesn`t apply anymore unless we get something for it. Well, within five days of those comments, remember the Chinese navy stealing a U.S. military underwater drone from an American ship in the South China Sea? Remember that, leading to another tense, weird standoff, where the Chinese a reportedly agreed to give the drone back after they kept it for a few days and then the president-elect said, actually, we don`t want it back. We shouldn`t take it back? It was very awkward and strange. Nobody knew exactly what was going to happen. Ultimately, Donald Trump was sworn in the following month, January 20th. After he was sworn in, the Chinese president did not call. Despite all the other world leader conversations, the new president had, China made no overtures. That, in turn, led to a bit of graveling from our new president, 11 days after the start of the Chinese New Year, the White House sent belated happy New Year`s greetings to the Chinese president and the Chinese people. And then on Friday, he did finally take his call with the Chinese president and the White House put out a statement about it. This remarkable statement. Quote, “The two leaders discussed numerous topics and President Trump agreed at the request of President Xi to honor our `One China` policy.” At the request of? That`s what you got for the “One China” policy. I mean, this is what I mean by careening. President Trump throws the “One China” policy out the window, puts our relationship with China at less than zero, communications between our two governments come to an end, we start having hard to explain isolated military confrontations between our troops and theirs and far flung locales. And then, just as suddenly, he totally capitulates. I mean, after saying the China policy no longer stands, if China wants that, if China wants that back, they`re going to have to give us something for it. And then, ultimately, the “One China” policy goes back into effect, at the request of the Chinese president. So, what we get out of that big bargain is nothing. That was the big deal. All right. You want this thing, you`re not going to get that thing unless you give us something and what we want for it is nothing. You can have it. What kind of a negotiation is that? What was that about? Why bother provoking China? Why bother provoking that country in that way at the very outset of your administration if you`re going to take it back when they ask. It was really strange. I mean, that is – that is where we were heading into this weekend, this bizarre, unfocused, unforced display of American weakness by our president. That was Friday. And then on Saturday, North Korea tested a brand-new ballistic missile that they claim is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. And at the time of that North Korean missile test, the president was having dinner at his Florida club with the prime minister of Japan. Japan, of course, is one of the countries most threatened by North Korea`s military and belligerence and their nuclear capability. So far, heading into this new presidency, our president`s take on North Korea has not always inspired confidence.",1,3691.0,645.0,host,3.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
3,TRUMP," One of the papers called the other say and they said, “Would you speak to the leader of North Korea?” I said, “Absolutely, why not?” And they come out. “Trump would speak to him.” Who the hell cares? I`ll speak to anybody. Who knows? There`s a 10 percent or a 20 percent chance that I can talk him out of those damn nukes because who the hell wants them to have nukes and there`s a chance. I`m only going to make a good deal for us.",1,433.0,87.0,guest,4.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
4,MADDOW," Wait until you see what kind of deal I got with China. When North Korea tested its missile on Sunday night and the president was at this dinner party with the Japanese prime minister, he apparently decided that he and the Japanese prime minister would just sort of work it out there at dinner on the terrace at Mar-a-Lago in front of all of the other guests attending the dinner as well. They did not leave and go to a secure facility. They did not take steps to isolate themselves to discuss whatever material they were discussing around this national security matter. We all just got to see it unfold on Facebook while paying club guests documented the American and Japanese reaction to the latest North Korea missile test on their cell phones because they were allowed to see it happen and post it on their social media feeds, because why not? It happened in front of them. The White House insisted today that nothing classified, nothing about North Korea at all was being discussed at that dinner table in front of all of those guests. The White House said even though it looked like a lot of people were scrambling around and there was a lot of paperwork, and they were reviewing documents, these guys were reading things, there were discussions involving multiple aides and translators, the White House says today actually that whole discussion was not about North Korea at all. It was just about, quote, “reviewing logistics for the press conference that happened later that evening after the dinner.” For the record, here was Donald Trump`s complete participation in that press conference. You can see why the logistics must have been really hard to work out, why it needed all those people.",1,1700.0,296.0,host,5.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
5,TRUMP," Thank you very much, Mr. Prime minister. I just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its a great ally, 100 percent. Thank you.",1,189.0,34.0,guest,6.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
6,MADDOW," That`s it. You sort of thought there was going to be more there for a second, right? No. That was it. All of the scrambling, all of the aides, all of the documents, all of the conferring, all of the translators and everything, obviously, it was nothing to do with North Korea. It was to plan the very complex press conference. “I just want everybody to know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, our great ally, 100 percent.” That was it, full stop. That`s how they left it on Saturday night at the Situation Room – I mean dinner. And now tonight, they careen back into traffic again because the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, she put out a formal statement tonight on behalf of the U.S. government also responding to the North Korean missile launch after those comments from the president on Saturday night, and Nikki Haley`s comment tonight basically threatens war over that missile launch. Quote, “We call on all members of the security council to use every available resource to make it clear to the North Korean regime and its enablers that these launches are unacceptable. It`s time to hold North Korea accountable, not with our words, but with our actions.” What actions? What actions are you threatening here? Actions against not only North Korea but its enablers. When people say North Korea`s enablers, they mean China. What actions is the U.S. government now threatening against not just North Korea but China tonight? And does that threat from the U.N. ambassador have anything at all to do with the president just saying we love Japan, good night, on Saturday, is his official response to the missile launch and the same president completely doing a 180 on his most important China policy the day before that with no explanation for the U-turn. Was that near miss between our plane and a Chinese military plane last week, an accident or was that a provocation on purpose? Is there anybody who`s running China at the National Security Council? Tonight, we`ve got a new treasury secretary. We`ve got a new V.A. secretary. Tomorrow, we`ll get a former wrestling executive, who`ll be confirmed as yet another cabinet secretary. In California tonight, nearly 200,000 people have been evacuated in the face of very worrying failures at the largest dam in this country. And the national security adviser might be getting fired. “The Washington Post” tonight reporting that the acting attorney general before she was fired warned the administration that the national security adviser might be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. We`ve got that story next. There`s a lot to keep an eye on. There`s a lot of balls in the air right now. But on national security, on the potential for military conflict with other countries, this White House is short circuiting and starting fires all over the place and careening incoherently from one irreconcilable position to another. And in a world where things proceed in a predictable way, at this world where you can always see the news coming, right, there was no snowstorms destroying your Orion aircraft in Japan. There was no insane autocratic child dictator shooting off ballistic missiles, right? If it was a world where stuff was predictable, we could afford to be another reckless, incoherent, random news generator among the country`s of the world. But to have the United States be the source of this much chaos and incompetence, that really is new on this earth. And I don`t know how we`re going to deal with did in terms of our domestic politics but increasingly with each passing day, I really don`t know how the rest of the world is going to deal with it either.",1,3653.0,624.0,host,7.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
7,MADDOW," So, we have some breaking news tonight that goes to the question not just of whether or not the national security adviser is about to be fired, but it also goes to how many people in the new administration knew the kind of trouble that National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was in, how many people knew about that and when they knew it. This is brand-new reporting from “The Washington Post” published just before we came on the air tonight. It`s headlined, “Justice Department warned White House that Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail.” Quote, “The acting attorney general informed the Trump White House late last month that she believed Michael Flynn had mislead senior administration officials about the nature of his communications with the Russian government and warned that the national security adviser was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail.” Now, you`ll recall that the acting attorney general, until last month, was Sally Yates. President Trump fired her when she said publicly that she believed his Muslim ban was illegal and she would not have the Justice Department defend it. That view, by the way, has been born out by many, many federal judges since she first put that in a letter to the new president. But before she was fired, she apparently told the White House that the national security adviser might be personally compromised and, again, vulnerable to Russian blackmail. “The Post” story tonight continues, quote, “in the waning days of the Obama administration, Jim Clapper, who`s director of national intelligence, and John Brennan, who was CIA director, shared Sally Yates` concerns and concurred with her recommendation to inform the Trump White House. They feared that Flynn had put himself in a compromising position.” A senior Trump official said that the White House was aware of the matter adding, quote, “we`ve been working on this for weeks.” For weeks, the Trump administration has known about this. For weeks. Really? Joining us now is Adam Entous. He`s “The Washington Post” reporter who broke this tonight. Mr. Entous, thanks very much for making time for us tonight. I really appreciate it.",1,2153.0,353.0,host,8.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
8,"ADAM ENTOUS, WASHINGTON POST NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER", No problem. Thank you.,1,23.0,5.0,guest,9.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
9,MADDOW," So, obviously, the headline here and the lead graph are arresting, jarring. Why exactly did the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, conclude or surmise that the Russian government might be able to blackmail Mike Flynn, the national security adviser?",1,252.0,40.0,host,10.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
10,ENTOUS," Right. So what happened was when this intelligence first came in, which would be in late December, early January, you know, Yates saw the intelligence and was concerned that Flynn was potentially in violation of what is known as the Logan Act, which is a very obscure statute which would bar a nongovernment official from trying to influence another government`s policies. And so, that really was – she knew that that was not something that would be pursued in court. There wouldn`t be a prosecution based on the Logan Act. After Pence, the vice president-elect, and other officials started speaking publicly in defense of Flynn when these calls – it emerged that these calls existed, when they started to say things like, I checked with Flynn and I can tell you now categorically that the issue of the election sanctions imposed by the Obama administration were not discussed in his phone calls with the Russian ambassador, when Yates and Clapper and Brennan heard that, they knew because they had read the intelligence that that was not accurate. And so, at that point, they knew that also the Russians knew themselves that what was being said was inaccurate because Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, had reported to Moscow his conversation with Flynn. And so, Russia knew that what was being said by the White House was not true and the fear was that basically the Russians could try to use that information to put that over Flynn and to try to put pressure on him. And, obviously, they were concerned that the vice president-elect, Pence, seemed to have been misled.",1,1570.0,269.0,guest,11.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
11,MADDOW," So, on that point about pressuring Flynn, let me shake make sure that I understand this precisely. If the Russians knew that they had discussed sanctions, that Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian government, and they know that he lied about it to the vice president and other senior officials, the Russian government conceivably could come to Mike Flynn, come to the national security adviser, and say, hey, we want to you do this thing for us and if you don`t, we`re going to tell the world or we`re going to tell the vice president or we`re going to tell the president of the United States that you`ve been lying to them. You wouldn`t want that to happen, would you? You better do what we want.",1,708.0,128.0,host,12.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
12,ENTOUS," I think it was less of a concern that they would tell the president of the United States or somebody else. I think the fear would be that they would actually just leak it publicly. And then Flynn would be obviously his reputation, his credibility would be tarnished. So, that was the concern. And so, by telling the counsel to Trump at the White House, the goal was to take that leverage away from the Russians. So, as long as people in the White House were aware that this was an issue, they could try to address it and try to mitigate the risk that this could compromise Flynn and potentially compromise the Trump administration in its future dealings with Russia.",1,667.0,122.0,guest,13.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
13,MADDOW," Adam, do you have any information about how the White House counsel Don McGahn reacted to this or whether the Trump administration took any internal action that they haven`t disclosed thus far publicly?",1,203.0,34.0,host,14.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
14,ENTOUS," Yes. I mean, so if – so we know that Yates provided this information to the counsel sometime near the end of January, before she was fired. Obviously, there`s a period of a couple of weeks that have passed since then and based on the surprise that Pence had to the breaking of the story last week that Flynn had discussed the sanctions with Kislyak, I`m surmising here, but I don`t know for sure, but that council certainly did not share this information with Pence, the vice president. It`s unclear really who shared the information. Also, we had an interview with Flynn last Wednesday in which he repeated what Pence, which is that, you know, Flynn insisted that he had not discussed sanctions with Kislyak. So, it appears, based on that, one would think that he was not aware. So, frankly, I just don`t know who the council at the White House consulted with bout this.",1,872.0,157.0,guest,15.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
15,MADDOW," Wow. That`s – I mean, that`s remarkable, that something this explosive comes to the White House counsel`s office and it doesn`t get fixed. That`s amazing. Adam Entous, “Washington Post” national security reporter – thank you for helping understand this scope. Appreciate it.",1,275.0,43.0,host,16.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13

17,MADDOW," Again, this news breaking tonight in “The Washington Post” within the last hour, Justice Department warned the White House that National Security Adviser Mike Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail, as “Washington Post” reporter Adam Entous said there. After that warning, the White House appears to have not acted on that news. Much more ahead tonight. Stay with us.",1,376.0,61.0,host,18.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
18,MADDOW," You know, the new president has only signed two bills since he came into office. One of them let`s the Government Accountability Office gather records more easily. Wake up, sleepy puppy. Don`t fall asleep on the Government Accountability Office gathering records more easily. Come on, little puppy. Oh. That`s fun. The other new law allowed General James Mattis to be sworn in as defense secretary, even though he`s only recently retired out of the military. We`re supposed to have civilian control over the military. But that`s it. Those are the two laws that the president has signed so far. That`s it, in terms of actual legislation. But look, this is interesting. Neither of those two new laws are posted on the White House website where they`re supposed to post new laws. This is supposed to be like the grown up version of putting your report card on the fridge. Look at all of the bills I`ve signed. Instead, it`s empty. Well, maybe the third time is a charm, because the president may get a shot at bill signing number three this week and it`s a doozy. In the Obama administration, they created a rule to try to keep guns out of the hands of people who are classified as seriously mentally disabled by the Social Security Administration. So if a person is too mentally disabled to be able to handle his or her own affairs, like, you know, cash your own checks and stuff, that will pop on a background check if that seriously mentally disabled person tries to buy a gun. Once President Obama left office, the Republican Congress decided that seriously mentally ill people definitely need easier access to firearms and they took a vote on it in the House and House Republicans on an almost perfect party line vote, they voted to get rid of that rule. They voted overtly to make it easier for the mentally ill to get guns. Almost a perfect party line vote on that. It passed the House. Now, it`s going to the Senate. There are 52 Republicans in the Senate and everybody expects them all to vote yes by a mile. Also, Joe Manchin, Democratic senator from West Virginia, he also says he will vote to end that rule. He will vote explicitly and only. It`s not like it`s folded into a more complicated thing. It`s just a vote to make it easier for seriously mentally ill people to have guns stand-alone now. So, thanks to Republicans and Joe Manchin, this bill is expected to pass easily. I mean, nobody campaigned in November on needing to put more guns in the hands of people suffering from serious and disabling mental illness. But it`s probably going to be the third piece of legislation that Trump signs. It has been a top priority for the NRA and now the bill is moving on grease skids.",1,2692.0,483.0,host,19.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
19,MADDOW," So, we`re watching a situation that continues to unfold tonight in Oroville, California, where nearly 200,000 people have been evacuated around the nation`s tallest dam and those communities are facing a real possibility of catastrophic flooding. Now, we spent some time on the show on Friday night trying to wrap our heads around the scale of that dam and the scale of the problem at that dam. That was our lead story on Friday show. But over the weekend, it became a crisis of much greater proportions. Again, we`re talking about a lot of people being evacuated, 188,000 people. Evacuation order came suddenly. Yesterday afternoon, people were told they might have only an hour to get out in time before possible failure and possibly catastrophic flooding at the site of the dam. This is the Oroville Dam in happier times. You can see the main body of the dam there on the right side. It`s nearly 800 feet tall. It`s taller than the Hoover Dam. It`s the tallest dam in the country. It was built in 1968 or opened in 1968. That dam created Lake Oroville, which is one of the two biggest reservoirs in California. It`s absolutely central to the drinking water system of the entire state. This is the centerpiece of how more than 20 million Californians get their drinking water. Because of the crazy weather in California this winter, Lake Oroville up at the top of that dam is quite full. As of midnight last night, it was 100 percent capacity. So, they have to release some of that water and the way they do that is by pumping water down this concrete spillway. So it flows, you know, nicely and calmly into the Feather River below, eventually into the Sacramento River out into the San Francisco Bay. But last week, the water coming down that spillway started looking crazy, right, shooting up and sideways and these churning plumes and the water looked really dirty. It`s not supposed to look like this. When they shut off the water to get a look at what was wrong, they discovered this massive sinkhole in this spillway and it was growing. How big is this hole in the spillway? It`s this big. That`s people. Those little yellow specks there are people inspecting the damage. But they have to keep running water down that spillway even if the water makes that hole worse, even if the water erodes more of that spillway because, as I said, the lake is full. Even pumping as much water as fast as they could down that dam and spillway was not enough as of this weekend. And on Saturday, for the first time in the 50-year history of that dam, they started pouring water over the dam`s emergency spillway as well. And the emergency spillway isn`t even really a spillway. It`s just a hillside. And that – there you go. That hillside even though, it`s supposed to be an emergency outlet for the water coming out of the lake, it did not hold up well this weekend. I think we`ve got a shot of what the hillside looked like before this weekend. Here`s what it looked like by yesterday afternoon. Yes. And see the lake there is on the left side. If that erosion underneath the rim of the reservoir there gets so bad that it takes out basically the wall that`s the rim of the reservoir, well, then all of that water`s going to come down the hill. This is when the evacuation order went out this week, when they realized that erosion was that catastrophic on the emergency spillway, when they realized the sudden erosion was happening. When they realized it was happening to that hillside, they realized that concrete lip holding the reservoir could fail and that could send a 30-foot wall of water into communities. So, when they sent out that evacuation order yesterday, they at that point thought that that could fail within one hour and that was the rush on the evacuation for all of those people. Now, again, looking at the overall structure, you see the dam is on the right side. It`s labeled Oroville Dam. That part of the dam, they say, is not in danger. And that`s good. But it`s not necessarily reassuring at this point when they keep sending huge amounts of water at high speed down the main spillway even though it`s got that giant sinkhole there, which very well could get bigger and could spread. If it spreads all the way up back the mountain to the gates of the dam, that too could be catastrophic. Meanwhile, the hole in the emergency spillway, if they need to put more water down there, that could also grow. That could undermine the concrete lip at the top of the reservoir, and that could be catastrophic. I mean, right now officials say they have managed to pump out enough water to lower the level of the lake by a few feet, and the water`s no longer coming over the emergency spillway but more rain is forecast for the day after tomorrow. And the question is whether they can pump out enough water down the damaged spillway by the time the next storm comes and then there`s the question of how they are going to shore up and rebuild these spillways. Crews have been trying to fill in the hole in the emergency spillway. They`ve been trying to buttress that concrete wall with boulders in bags delivered by helicopter. That sounds easy. The sheriff says he doesn`t know when the nearly 200,000 people who have been evacuated will be able to come back home. There`s no timeline yet for when this will be safe. Just an extremely scary time for residents of that area and for all of California which depends on this massive piece of very broken infrastructure for a statewide functioning water system that literally provides water to tens of millions of people. Joining us now from the Oroville Dam is Congressman John Garamendi. A hundred fifty thousand of the people evacuated because of this dam are from his district. Congressman, thank you very much for joining us tonight. I know these are trying times.",1,5821.0,1041.0,host,20.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
20,MADDOW," Congressman, do you feel like from what you know about this infrastructure and the California Department of Water Resources and the sheriff and the other authorities that are brought to bear on this, do you feel like this crisis is being well-managed, well-handled? Do you have confidence in the people in charge of this ongoing situation?",1,340.0,57.0,host,21.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
21,GARAMENDI," There`s several pieces to this puzzle. Let me kind of take them apart, Rachel. The issue of the emergency evacuation last night I think was absolutely essential. That water was continuing to pour over the top of that emergency spillway and continuing the erosion. Looking at some of that today in the light of day, yes, it was really serious last night. Fortunately, when they were able to open the main spillway gates, they began to lower the reservoir level because the river water coming into the reservoir was about half of what they were able to expel down the main spillway. So, it`s stabilized. But nonetheless – so they did make the right call last night. Now, the next call will be, can this thing be patched up sufficient to withstand the storms that are clearly out ahead of us, one coming up later this week and even more as we move into March and early April, which are the heavy storm times here in the state. So, we`ve got a lot of – let`s call it tight time ahead of us. What happened before and why did that sinkhole happen? Was there somebody that overlooked the safety of that spillway and then there`s the question about the emergency spillway not having a concrete apron all the downhill side. Why didn`t that take place in the years past?",1,1261.0,230.0,guest,22.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
22,MADDOW," Congressman, obviously you`ve got 150,000 of your constituents who are not at home tonight, people who are not knowing how long this is going to go on. It`s a scary situation. It`s a human health and safety situation and quickly I imagine for many families already becoming a serious economic situation when we look at this as an infrastructure problem. I – it boggles my mind to think how expensive this is going to be to get it fixed. I understand that Governor Jerry Brown has put in an initial request for an emergency declaration from the White House. Do you have any comment on that or any expectations in terms of whether or not California is going to be able to just handle this and whether families will be able to handle this economically?",1,750.0,136.0,host,23.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
23,GARAMENDI," Well, it`s certainly a tremendous strain on the families. I was at one of the centers down in Woodland, about 50 miles downstream from this area and mostly kids, young families. And you know, they are not able to work. And so, these communities are clearly having a major economic loss. Can that emergency declaration that`s been requested by the governor and hopefully approved by the president, would that provide some economic relief? I think the answer is probably not to the individuals. But surely, there would be some additional federal money to help rebuild this system. But this is just one really startling and very tragic and quite potentially a catastrophic example of what`s happened to the infrastructure across America. We`ve seen bridges collapse in Minnesota. We`ve seen them on I-5 up in Washington state and now this reservoir which is the linchpin of California`s water system may be inoperable in the year ahead because of the silt that has now filled the river below the powerhouse, which is the way in which water ultimately gets out of the reservoir and flows to southern California.

29,MADDOW," Mystery solved. We think. Last month, “Politico” reported on the existence of an old tape, having to do with the man on the right there, nominee to be labor secretary, Andy Puzder. This old tape supposedly showed Mr. Puzder`s former wife in disguise on a vintage episode of the Oprah Winfrey Show. According to this report, his ex-wife appeared on the Oprah show in disguise to describe abuse that she said took place in her marriage to Andy Puzder who`s now nominated for the Trump cabinet. Both Mr. Puzder and his ex-wife have now denied there was any abuse in their relationship. You can imagine why anybody in the world was trying to find that old tape so people could find out what she was saying about it at the time. Well, tonight, we are learning that not only has that tape finally surfaced, it has surfaced in the United States Senate, three days before Andy Puzder`s supposed to have his confirmation hearing in the United States Senate. It`s a sort of amazing story and if the reporting on this is correct, it`s double amazing for how that tape made its way to Washington, D.C., and who has been watching it already. That story is next.",1,1149.0,207.0,host,30.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13
30,MADDOW," Right around lunchtime today, this happened at the hairs of Hardee`s in St. Louis, Missouri. These folks marched into the corporate offices of the Hardee`s fast food chain. The same time, protesters were also marching outside the California headquarters of Carl`s Jr. today. The nominee to be the new secretary of labor in this country is the CEO of Hardee`s and Carl`s Jr. His name is Andy Puzder. His confirmation hearing is supposed to business this Thursday. But this is what kickoff to his confirmation week looked like in more than two dozen cities around the country. Democratic senators have fought hardest so far against Betsy DeVos to be education secretary and Jeff Sessions to be attorney general, but Democrats actually think they`ve got the best chance of beating the nomination of this guy. Since he`s been CEO, Puzder`s fast food restaurants have been accused of erasing people`s work hours out of time charts in order to avoid paying them overtime. They`ve been accused of telling their employees to clock out and sit in the parking lot when business is slow, so the employees don`t get paid for that time. They`ve been accused of breaking child labor laws. They`ve also been accused of requiring their employees to pay 10 cents an hour every hour for the privilege of wearing a work uniform. So, you can see why fast food workers would be willing to make a fuss in his corporate offices today. For the record, his defenders say it`s the individual restaurant store owners who are responsible for stuff like this, not Andy Puzder. He`s just the CEO. But then there`s this. A court in Missouri tomorrow will decide whether or not to unseal Mr. Puzder`s divorce records. These records reportedly include allegations of domestic abuse made against him by his former wife in the 1980s. His former wife since recanted those allegations but today there`s a new wrinkle in that part of the story. “Politico” reported a few weeks ago that Andy Puzder`s ex-wife had once appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show, around the time of their divorce. She appeared in disguise to talk about being a victim of domestic violence. That reporting from “Politico” in January set off a frenzy of people searching for that tape of that “Oprah Winfrey Show”. Nobody apparently found it. Well, today, three days before the hearing in the Senate on Andy Puzder`s confirmation, the tape has reportedly surfaced. “The Washington Post” reporting that one of the four Republican senators who now says he or she is on the fence about Andy Puzder is Maine Senator Susan Collins. And she said she has reviewed footage of an “Oprah Winfrey Show” interview with Puzder`s ex-wife. Tonight, “Politico” reports further the tape was provided to senators of both parties by the Oprah Winfrey Network. The episode was reportedly called “High Class Battered Women.” They say it aired in March 1990. Republican chairman on the committee overseeing Puzder`s nomination, Lamar Alexander, says he supports Puzder`s nomination although Senator Alexander, himself, has arranged for his colleagues on the committee to see the Oprah tape. He says the whole thing for him is not an issue. The top Democrat on the issue disagrees, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, who said she watched the tape and she was, quote, “deeply troubled by it.” Even before this development, we knew Andy Puzder was having serious trouble getting through the vetting process. His paperwork only came through this past week. It was revealed he hired an undocumented worker as a nanny and that he did not pay taxes for that person. His hearing has already being delayed five times. But we now know this video of his ex-wife talking about abuse allegations against him in their marriage, that`s now in rotation on Capitol Hill. Andy Puzder could only afford to lose two Republican votes if all Democrats vote against his nomination. It`d only take one Republican no vote in committee to see his nomination to the full seat, with an unfavorable recommendation. And on that committee, there are those four Republicans who say they`re on the fence. And all of this is the street level opposition to his nomination continues to gather momentum. This is going to be a close one and an interesting one. That does it for us tonight. We will see you again tomorrow. Now, it`s time your “THE LAST WORD,” my friend, Joy Reid, sitting in for Lawrence tonight. Good evening, Joy.",1,4406.0,746.0,host,31.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-13

0,"RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST"," And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. Lots going on tonight, obviously, as we are absorbing this unanimous ruling from the federal appeals court, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Bottom line, by now, you have heard the president`s ban is not in effect, he refugee ban, the travel ban on people from majority Muslim countries. It is legally blocked by this ruling. The Trump administration has been denied again in its efforts to have its ban reinstated. And we`re going to hear in just a couple of minutes from some of the people who have been involved directly in this case, including the man who brought this case. We`ll hear about what this means, what is expected to happen next. We`ll hear about how – sort of what the scope is of this ruling, what the judges could have ruled on and what they did rule on. But, you know, for those of us who aren`t lawyers and those of us who are watching this case so raptly, not just because we care about this policy but also because we care about our country more broadly and we`re wondering what this new administration is going to be like, we wonder what they`re going to do, we`re interested in this as the first big fight between the judicial branch of government and this new executive branch of government coming to power with President Trump. For those of us who have been watching it because of those bigger dynamics, not just stuff specific to this policy, I want to bring to the table two things tonight. that I think are important to understanding those bigger levels of importance. And one of them is something very specific. One of them is some new polling data among Trump supporters as to whether or not Trump supporters think the new president should follow court orders even if he doesn`t agree with them. We`ve got that new national data exclusively here tonight. Nobody else has this. We`re gong to break that news tonight. It will curl your hair when you hear it and I think it`s important to hear. We`ve got that coming up in just a few minutes. That`s one. The other thing I want to bring to the table, though, is from this ruling itself. You know what the bottom line is, right? The bottom line is the ban cannot go back into effect. The ban is legally enjoined. It`s not in effect right now. But beyond that bottom line, at several points in this ruling, the judges in the Ninth Circuit Court appear to – again, I`m not a lawyer, but it appears they basically have to explain some very basic, very basic civics and government to the new administration, like fifth grade stuff because at least the way the ruling is written, they seem to think the government doesn`t know basic stuff about what they`re supposed to do and how stuff works. So, I just want to point out a couple of these instances in the ruling because I think it seems important regardless of the specifics of this policy. I think it seems important. We`re all watching to see what happens when the judicial branch and the Trump administration come into conflict. Now that we have seen that happen, one of the things that have been exposed by that conflict is that the court has had to explain stuff so basic, you would expect a high school freshman to have already mastered it and the court had to explain this to the administration because the administration didn`t know it already so let me give you a couple of these from the ruling. Here`s the first one. Even if you are not a lawyer, you will see what I mean here, this isn`t like a complex point of order. This is like hey, duh, you guys. It`s footnote eight, this first one I want to show you. Footnote eight, quote, “The government asserts that unlike the president, courts do not have access to classified information about the threats posed by terrorist organizations operating in particular nations. The efforts of those organizations to infiltrate the United States or gaps in the vetting process”. But – you can sort of hear the court`s voice here, you guys. “But you guys, the government may provide a court with classified information. Courts regularly receive classified information under seal and maintain its confidentiality. Regulations and rules have long been in place for that.” And they give a list of those rules and regulations by which courts very regularly receive classified information and keep it under seal. Right? I mean think about this. It`s one thing if you`re in politics, you here in the administration, one thing to tell the public, oh, you don`t know the scary stuff we know. If you knew, you`d support everything we`re doing. It`s one thing to say that to the public, to say that to the press. But you can literally not say that to a federal appeals court because if there`s something important in the information you`ve got about terrorism, if there`s some important classified information that you`ve got that is Germane to why you have to take this policy action, you can show that to the court. The Supreme Court is allowed to see anything you want them to see. Federal court sees super-duper tippitytop classified information all the time. You guys know that, right? It`s not actually a defense against review by the judiciary that the judiciary hasn`t seen what you`ve seen. If that`s your argument, you then have to show them what you`ve seen. You don`t get that? Here`s another one. That`s footnote eight. That`s my personal favorite. Here`s another one. This is the part where the Trump administration is telling the court, don`t rule on anything in the ban, don`t rule on anything in the executive order that has to deal with legal permanent residents, that has to do with people with green cards. Remember when they implemented this in the first place and this was all this confusion as to not just whether or not people who were citizens of other countries could come visit, but what happened people who had green cards? What about people who are legal permanent residents of the United States who are basically all but citizens? They can do everything but vote. People who lived here for decades. People could clear – you`re going to apply it to them, too? Yes, we are. No, we`re not. Are you applying it to them? We sure are. There was all this confusion about that, right? Well, in the court ruling tonight, they addressed the fact the government is saying, hey, listen, don`t rule on anything that has to do with people with green cards, we`re saying the ban doesn`t apply to them anymore. Here`s how that looks in the ruling. This is on page 21. Quote, “The government has argued that the state`s challenge to the executive order based on the order`s application to lawful permanent residents, that challenge is moot because several days after the executive order was issued, White House counsel Don McGahn issued authoritative guidance stating that the executive order doesn`t apply to lawful permanent residents.” That`s what you`re saying. You`re saying they shouldn`t challenge that because we say it doesn`t apply to green card holders. Well, here`s the burn from the court. Here`s what the court says. Quote, “At this point, however, we cannot rely on the government`s contention the order no longer applies to lawful permanent residents. The government has offered no authority establishing that the White House counsel is empowered to issue an amended order superseding the executive order signed by the president.” And that proposition seems unlikely. Quote, “The White House counsel is not the president. And he is not known to be in the chain of command for any of the executive departments. Moreover, in light of the government`s shifting interpretations of the executive order, we can`t say that the current interpretation by the White House counsel will persist past the immediate stage of these proceedings.” In other words you guys, it`s called an executive order. You can`t just say, oh, you know what? Don`t rule on that part of the executive order, we`ve decided to change that now, never mind what it says. That`s not how it works. The White House counsel says, don`t pay attention to that part of the executive order anymore? That`s not good enough. It`s still until the executive order. So, stuff like this in the ruling tonight. It is materially interesting I think because it implies that the new administration is not only getting clearly shut down by the courts they`re also completely blowing it on basic stuff. I mean, the nut of this ruling is that the Trump administration is wrong when they say the president has unreviewable authority to do whatever he wants on immigration. The court knocks that one`s head off, right? This is the part you`ve seen quoted all night. “There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy”. I mean, that`s the nut of this here. And that`s as simple as it gets. No president has unreviewable authority. No president in American laws says a president has unreviewable authority. Even on national security, even on immigration, of course, the president is reviewable, that`s why we have a judicial branch of government that answers only to the Constitution. That`s the nut of the ruling. Even on that point, though, I can get that there will be a fight about that. There can be a fight about that. There will be a fight about that. The part that takes me aback is the dumb stuff, right? I mean, they don`t know that a presidential executive order actually means what it says? And no one other than the president can fix it if it is screwed up, right? They don`t know that courts can look at secret stuff? I mean, that`s not just regular legal back and forth. That`s like watching Roger Federer trying to play tennis with a two-year-old. But, wow, this is our government now. Joining us now is Bob Ferguson, the attorney general of Washington state who, it should be noted, won tonight. It was his office that brought this challenge to the executive order. Mr. Attorney General, appreciate your time in the midst of all this. Congratulations on your win tonight.",1,10075.0,1756.0,host,1.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
1,"BOB FERGUSON, WASHINGTON STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL"," Thank you so much, Rachel. Great to see you again.",1,51.0,11.0,guest,2.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
2,MADDOW," So, you expressed confidence from the very beginning that you thought you would prevail in this case. Did you prevail in the way that you thought you did? One of the things I thought was interesting about the ruling is that the judges made decisions to weigh in on certain parts of the argument, and others, they put aside and said we have no need to weigh in on those pieces of it. Did this happen the way you thought it would?",1,429.0,83.0,host,3.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
3,FERGUSON," Let`s put it this way, Rachel, it`s a unanimous ruling and we could not have written a better ruling from our perspective. The court essentially granted everything we wanted at this stage of the proceedings.",1,208.0,36.0,guest,4.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
4,MADDOW, What happens next?,1,19.0,4.0,host,5.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
5,FERGUSON," That`s up to the federal government. They can appeal or seek review from the U.S. Supreme Court. Again, I do not think that they will find much in their favor with the Supreme Court. So, what`s going to happen is it will go back to Judge Robart, the trial court judge appointed by George W. Bush who granted the temporary restraining order and will have proceedings on the merits of our claims and discovery where we can see depositions and documents from the administration to make our case.",1,493.0,89.0,guest,6.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
6,MADDOW," OK. So on the discovery and depositions part of it, one of the things that was very interesting about tonight`s ruling is that the judges brought into their ruling public statements from the administration. They referenced the exhibits, the evidence you provided which you said essentially proved the intent of the ban. You said the statements by the president, statements by members of the administration indicated this was basically intended to be a version of a Muslim ban and so that showed something about the state of mind that led to this executive order. If it goes back to the trial court and you can do discovery and take depositions and stuff, will you be try to figure out how this was written, what the intentions were behind writing it the way it was written who took part in putting it together?",1,811.0,143.0,host,7.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
7,FERGUSON," Yes to all of the above. That`s exactly right. Part of our case, we have many claims, as you know, Rachel, both statutory and constitutional, but when it gets to that issue of – on the religious side, preferring one religion over another, yes, we are entitled to seek documents, to take depositions, to help establish our case. And one thing that`s important to point south that trial court judge, Judge Robart, in order to grant that temporary restraining order, one thing he had to determine or grant that significant relief is a likelihood that we will ultimately prevail on the merits, which is I think is a clear signal which direction this case is ultimately heading.",1,674.0,118.0,guest,8.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
8,MADDOW," If it does proceed the way you are expecting it to, do you anticipate you`ll get sworn testimony from the president himself at some point?",1,139.0,26.0,host,9.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
9,FERGUSON," Like I said, I don`t want to get out ahead of my team on this. We`ll obviously be having a thoughtful approach this. But you can be sure that I will use every tool at my disposal, Rachel, as we have so far, to make sure the president is held to the rule of law and his administration. I will absolutely accept nothing less than that. We`re a nation of laws. Everybody must follow our laws and that includes the president of the United States.",1,443.0,86.0,guest,10.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
10,MADDOW," Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, I know a very busy night for you. Thank you for taking time to talk with us. I really appreciate it, sir.",1,154.0,29.0,host,11.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09

12,MADDOW," Thank you. I want to bring in to the conversation now, the great Nina Totenberg, legal affairs correspondent for NPR. Nina, it`s really nice to see you this evening. Thank you very much for being with us.",1,205.0,38.0,host,13.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
13,"NINA TOTENBERG, NPR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT", My pleasure.,1,13.0,3.0,guest,14.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
14,MADDOW, Can you give us a layman`s understanding of what the court could have done and how much they did within that realm of possibility? How far did they go and how emphatic was this ruling?,1,185.0,36.0,host,15.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
15,TOTENBERG," It was pretty emphatic but still pretty limited, because all this was about was the temporary restraining order, the stay on the government from continuing to enforce that executive order. So, now, comes the question of whether the order itself is constitutional or not within the statutes and there are lots of arguments on that.",1,331.0,56.0,guest,16.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
16,MADDOW," Do you think the Washington state attorney general who we just heard from is right in assessing that probably the next step here is that this is going to be back with the trial court judge? Back with the district court judge and it will be a matter of working this out on the merits, taking depositions, getting – using discovery to get to both the intent and the impact of this order?",1,386.0,74.0,host,17.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
17,TOTENBERG," I think that`s probably right although you can never be sure. I would doubt the Supreme Court really wants to get into this now. Courts usually like to have a record, something to base their opinion on, and the Ninth Circuit panel made the compelling argument in their decision that the government hadn`t shown that it was irreparably harmed, whereas the people who were being hurt by this were being irreparably harmed, and that the government hadn`t shown there was any serious danger, that they were free to do that, they hadn`t done that, but the people obviously were being harmed by this. So, my guess is that the Supreme Court, especially with only eight members, would rather not touch this right now and I wouldn`t be surprised if the administration – I mean, Donald Trump tweeted tonight, “See you in court, the national security is at stake.” But it might be the better part of valor to write a more circumscribed executive order, have the president of the United States sign it and try to defend that.",1,1014.0,179.0,guest,18.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
18,MADDOW," Does it matter that there isn`t a new solicitor general? We reported last night that Chuck Cooper, conservative lawyer from Washington was a leading contender to be the solicitor general in the new administration. Today, he has pulled his name from contention. They don`t have anybody in that position. Obviously, the attorney general has been in office for a day. As the administration starts to gel with getting more people into top legal positions, do you expect that we might see a change in strategy or just in tone from them on this?",1,540.0,94.0,host,19.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
19,TOTENBERG," We might. I mean, they have so few people in place and some of the acting people were Don McGahn`s law partners and have refused themselves from signing on to – they took their names off the brief, perhaps with an excess of caution about potential conflicts of interest, but they did. And, you know, people who come into the new administration in the first days talk about walking down empty halls, seeing empty garages with no cars because all the people who run these departments are gone and what they`re replaced by with this time in a rather extraordinary way are people who don`t have much government experience. So, they don`t – they haven`t been through this before. And it`s showed in some of the execution, shall we put it.",1,734.0,132.0,guest,20.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
20,MADDOW," Certainly, it seemed that way, and the way that the ruling was written about some of the particulars of this order. Nina Totenberg, legal affairs correspondent for NPR, thank you so much for being with us tonight to help us understand it.",1,239.0,43.0,host,21.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
21,TOTENBERG," My pleasure, Rachel.",1,21.0,4.0,guest,22.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
22,MADDOW," All right. As I said earlier, still ahead tonight, we`ve got something to add to the conversation around this. I think add to the big picture observation about this administration coming to loggerheads with the judicial branch for the first time. We`ve got something to add to that that you can`t get anywhere else that we`ve got exclusively tonight which is new national polling among Trump supporters as to whether they think the president should follow court orders he disagrees with. It`s pretty stunning stuff. We`ve got that ahead exclusively tonight. We`ll also be joined live tonight by the executive director of the national ACLU, Anthony Romero. It`s a big night. Stay with us.",1,688.0,115.0,host,23.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
23,MADDOW," So, we are still absorbing the news tonight of this new ruling from the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. This is a court one level below the U.S. Supreme Court. A unanimous panel of that court tonight brushing back the new administration once again on the refugee ban and the Muslim ban. But to that conversation, we`ve gotten an important piece of new data to add to the understanding of what this means, because everybody is wondering about how this new administration, this new president is going to test the strength of our constitutional system, right? Everybody is wondering if the president will feel bound to respect the courts, particularly if the courts keep blocking his policies like they`ve been doing so far. Well, we`ve got new information tonight that gives us I think an important metric on that front. Now, we`ve got this exclusively tonight, brand new national polling data from PPP. This is the second time in a few weeks from Public Policy Polling has given us a look at this data. And I`m thankful to them for letting us see it first. I think tonight, this is particularly on the nose newsworthy because in one important instance, it shows us the difference between where the country is at in terms of accepting this new administration and approving or not of what the new president is doing. It shows us the distance between where the country is at as a whole, and where Trump supporters are at. And watch what that looks like when it comes to whether or not the president ought to obey the rule of law, whether he ought to obey the federal courts or not. OK, so first let me give you kind of the big picture. The White House is not going to like any of this, overall. But I`m going to give you the top line national results here. I will go through these quickly. They all point the same direction. Do you approve or disapprove of President Donald Trump`s job performance? Answer, disapprove, 43 percent-53 percent. A net 10-point disapproval rate. Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Donald Trump? Answer, unfavorable. Do you support or oppose Donald Trump`s refugee and Muslim travel ban? Oppose. Do you think the ban was well-executed or poorly executed? Poorly executed. And then the answers to the subsequent questions just go exactly the way you`re thinking they`re going go, exactly the way the White House doesn`t want to see. Do you think the intent of the executive order was to ban Muslims from the United States? Answer, yes. It was the intent of that order to ban Muslims. Do you support or oppose banning Muslims from the United States? Answer, by a large margin, oppose. Who do you trust more to make the right decisions for the United States – judges or Donald Trump? Answer, judges. Do you support or oppose the Affordable Care Act? Answer, support. Do you want Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act? The answer is no. No by a lot, do not repeal it. Americans also say by a large margin that Donald Trump should release his tax returns. Americans now say by a larger margin he should divest himself from his business interests, something he has not done. In terms of the new administration`s other signature policies, Americans, since you asked, oppose building a wall with Mexico if American taxpayers have to pay up front for the wall. Americans don`t think millions of people voted illegally in the last election even though the president says they did. And look at this one. Asked about the “New York Times” and “Saturday Night Live,” Americans think both of those institutions have more credibility than President Donald Trump. So, it`s just unrelentingly bad news for the new administration in this new national poll. In terms of how the country views the president, his policies, his credibility, I mean, broadly sneaking the country doesn`t even believe him when he asserts that something is true. This is interesting, though, even though every question in the national poll turns up a top line result that is bad news for the new administration, look at this. This is question 32 in the new poll. “Would you support or oppose impeaching Donald Trump?” Answer, dunno. Hmm, sure, 46 percent of the country is all ready to impeach the president less than three weeks into his time in office and that`s remarkable, but look at the opposed number. Even Steven, 46-46. And almost 10 percent of people say they`re not sure. So, maybe that`s some comfort to the new president. Three weeks to his first term, he`s still four points away from an actual majority of the country wanting him impeached. Of course, there`s another way to look at the impeachment number, which is worse for the new president and the new administration. Think about it. It`s kind of interesting, right? I mean, you look at results of this poll, people not liking the new president, not liking his policies, not believing him, not trusting him. It`s kind of interesting in a poll like this, the only question where he`s not underwater is should he be impeached? That`s interesting, right? Here`s the black cloud inside that silver lining. I think the really bad news for the administration here is that this might be why we`re getting that result on the impeachment question. Look, quote, “Who would you rather was president? Mike Pence or Donald Trump?” Answer from the American public. Ooh, not sure. Despite these spectacularly negative polling results for everything having to do with the new president, the only place he comes close to a positive polling result is when people are asked to consider if Mike Pence might be even worse. So, yes, maybe hold off on impeachment for a minute. That would make Pence president? Yes, not sure. Again this is new national polling data from PPP. We`ve got this exclusively here tonight. But here is the on-the-nose part that I think is really important for what just happened this evening in the Ninth Circuit Court, and the angry response the president has already had to this court, and to other multiple federal judges who have ruled against him on his refugee ban and Muslim ban so far. This is what you get if you ask Americans as a whole, quote, “Do you think Donald Trump should be able to overturn decisions by judges that he disagrees with?” Asked the whole country, yes or no, the answer, resoundingly, by almost 40 points is no. No, of course not. We`re Americans. We know how the Constitution works, right? The president should not be able to overturn decisions by judges just because he disagrees with those decisions. That`s the national answer. But now look at this. Ask that same question to Donald Trump supporters and this is what you get. Donald Trump voters, an actual majority of them, say that Donald Trump should be able to overturn decisions by judges that he disagrees with, 51 percent of Trump supporters say, yeah, yeah, he should. And so, tonight, the judiciary once again in the biggest way yet, said no to the president. This three-judge panel, the federal appeals court judges unanimously ruling that the Trump refugee ban and Muslim ban cannot go into effect. Trump voters say this president should be able to throw that ruling aside and do whatever he likes. There`s a slim majority, 51 percent of Trump supporters, but that`s a majority of Trump supporters, wildly different than the rest of the country`s view on the subject, wildly different than anything the Constitution would allow, but honestly, stick a pin in that, man, that`s an important benchmark to note here. What does this make him feel like he can do? And does that number among his supporters rise even further if he keeps attacking judges and he keeps attacking the courts that are now standing in his way? I think this is a benchmark moment here. This is important stuff. Watch this space. We`ve got Anthony Romero from the ACLU here, next.",1,7825.0,1361.0,host,24.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09

He said he was on his way to dinner with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and billionaire Republican donor Sheldon Adelson. I wonder what they`ll be talking about over dinner. Joining us is Anthony Romero, president of the ACLU, which filed an amicus brief on behalf of the state of Washington in this case.

And what`s remarkable is when he steals our tag line “see you in court”, I feel like I want to sue him for that. This was my tag line back in September and October. But yet, the president really does very cumbersome things that are troubling and problematic. The idea he says that we`re going to question the validity of these judges, that it`s a political decision undercuts the credibility of our court, troubling even his Supreme Court nomination Mr. Gorsuch in talking with senators than disheartened by some of those comments. And then the polling you just showed, the impact it has on the American people on his supporters.

They`re all holding their breaths and pretending they`re not washing this disaster play on the national scene and if we have real leaders in Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan and they believe in the court system and they believe in the oath that they took to be in Congress and the Senate, they need to speak up, because otherwise, their whole constituency, that 51 percent that believes Mr. Trump doesn`t have to follow the judicial orders, that`s their base.

51,MADDOW," Welcome to Morris, Minnesota. Morris, Minnesota, is in western Minnesota, out in the plains. It`s a really tiny town, it`s really cute. Population about 5,000 people. This is their stoplight. The county that includes Morris, Minnesota, went double digits for Trump in the last election. But look at this. In little Morris, Minnesota, they now have 300 people signed up for one of these Indivisible groups, people that are using the Indivisible guide to plan their activism to oppose the new administration and their agenda. There`s 5,000 people in the up to, that`s how many people they got to turn out for their first Indivisible meeting. That`s Indivisible Morris, Minnesota. They will now be part of these visits and protests by local voters to the offices of their lawmakers. We have been watching these evolve over the past three weeks. As you would expect, people are starting to get more resourceful. That one we just showed there, that was in Jim Risch`s office in Idaho. Indivisible Idaho. That`s amazing. People are getting more resourceful over time. In Troy, Michigan, Congressman Dave Trott`s office posted a sign on the door that said “we do not accept walk in appointments.” That meant the guy in the chicken suit had to wait outside. But inside, these constituents from Dave Trott`s district just posted their feedback right on his office door since they wouldn`t let them in the door so he`ll have notes waiting for him. Thank you very much. It`s kind of an important dynamic in terms of trying to understand the actions of our legislators to know what`s going on in their home districts. People who have not been active in politics before are barnstorming their legislators in huge numbers and asking them to listen up. This weekend, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden held a town hall in his home state, more than 1,500 people showed up. A lot of them people who said they had never gone to a town hall before. In Utah, the district represented by Congressman Jason Chaffetz, his constituents have been hounding him for weeks to hold a town hall. He finally announced one for tonight and more than 1,200 people from his district RSVP`d. That town hall is tonight and this is how they welcomed Congressman Chaffetz as he walked out on to the stage. You can hear a hail of boos and saying “do your job, do your job.” They have been jeering and chanting on and off. He`s been struggling through a Q&A with this roomful of his constituents, but he`s still hanging in there trying to answer questions. Good for you for finally doing this, Congressman, but this is a town hall where 1,200 of your constituents RSVP`d so they could ask these questions they`ve had bottled up for weeks. And I think it`s not going to get easier as the night goes on. But this is going on right now, right this second in Jason Chaffetz` district in Utah.

52,MADDOW," Five days before the election in November, the governor of Alabama, this handsome devil, Republican Governor Robert Bentley, he got some excellent news. That sweet, sweet, sweet news was that the Alabama House impeachment investigation against him had been put on pause, had been put on hold. You might remember last year Governor Bentley made national headlines for his involvement in a surprisingly high octane sex scandal for this retired dermatologist and church deacon. The crusading family values Republican governor had allegedly been having an affair with one of his close advisers, he denied it, but the scandal blew sky high with the release of a sex tape, an audiotape in which the governor could be heard saying a lot of very specific lurid things about how – what he wanted to do to and with his lover, who he denied was his lover. That`s burned into my brain like somebody wrote it there with a branding iron. Anyway, once the tape and the rest came to light, a committee in the Alabama legislature launched an impeachment investigation into whether the governor used state resources to help cover up the affair. By September, that committee issued subpoenas for the governor`s documents. The investigation was proceeding but then five days before the presidential election, November 3rd that impeachment inquiry into the legislature got put on hold, got put on hold at the direction of the state attorney general, Republican attorney general of Alabama, his name is Luther Strange. He told the legislature that their investigation could interfere with this investigation. They should put their proceedings on hold. Let the A.G. take it from here. The attorney general wrote a letter to the legislature, November 3rd that said it would be, quote, “prudent and beneficial to delay the work of the House Judiciary Committee,” quote, “I respectfully request that the committee cease active interviews and investigation until I am able to report to you that the necessary related work of my office has been completed.” Letter dated November 3rd. Five days later, Donald Trump won the presidential election. Today, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions was sworn in as the country`s 84th attorney general. And back in Alabama, Governor Bentley got to announce who he would pick to replace Jeff Sessions as Alabama`s senator. Want to guess who he picked? It`s too easy. Obviously, he picked the attorney general, Luther Strange, the guy who put the kibosh on the investigation in the legislature because of his own related investigation. Today, he jetted to Washington to be sworn in as your newest United States senator. Back in Alabama, today`s events were greeted with headlines like these. “Robert Bentley`s Strange Bargain Sets New Benchmark for Alabama Corruption.” Or this one, “Luv Guv`s Strange Appointment: Naked Alabama Politics.” But at today`s announcement in Montgomery, the Alabama press corps was assured there was nothing to see here, all totally above board.",1,2977.0,484.0,host,53.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09

Not only did the governor of Alabama just get to give the deal of a lifetime, right, the deal of a lifetime, a job for life as U.S. senator to the guy who may or may not have been investigating him for this thing to potentially get impeached for, but he now also get to pick his replacement as attorney general. So, gets to pick basically the outcome for the investigation of his impeachment scandal and sex scandal, which made today an even better day for the governor of Alabama than that day five days before the election.

60,MADDOW," So, for those of us who haven`t been following the politics here closely, nut up for us here for a second, why this particular appointment is so problematic. I was struck by a comment from the state auditor that of all the people who the governor was considering putting in that Jeff Sessions seat, that the one that you should pray he doesn`t pick, the one that was so ethically disastrous would be for him to put Luther Strange there. Why has there been such concern?",1,470.0,87.0,host,61.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-09
61,ARCHIBALD," Well, because this is a guy who`s holding a special grand jury that is considering whether to indict the governor of Alabama.

62,MADDOW," In terms of what happens next here, obviously the special election is not going to be until 2018. Meanwhile, though, the governor now gets to also pick a new attorney general, right?

63,ARCHIBALD," Right. And let`s face it. The attorney general himself has not been really involved in these investigations. He`s more like: I don`t want to be involved and let professional prosecutors handle it. A number of the people that are being talked about as replacements are close friends of Bentley or close to Bentley.

I think most of them that I have talked to certainly find it unbelievable and they really do believe if Luther Strange really wanted to be senator for life, he would have had the nerve to say, no, to this appointment and to not seek it.

69,MADDOW," OK. We`ve got breaking news. National security story just posted by “The Washington Post” about national security adviser Michael Flynn and the contacts with Russia. “The Washington Post” just posted this. National security adviser Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian envoy before Trump took office despite denials, officials say. So, this is something that the national security adviser Mike Flynn had been asked about yesterday. Flynn yesterday denied that he had ever discussed Russian sanctions with the Russian ambassador. Asked in an interview with “The Washington Post” whether he had ever done so, he twice said, no. Today, however, Flynn sent out a spokesman to retract that denial, basically, to back away from that denial. Now, the spokesman from Flynn says that he indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn`t be certain that the topic never came up. Obviously, the issue here is twofold. One is that the FBI reportedly is continuing to investigate General Flynn`s contact with the Russians. Whether or not that is specific to the issue of sanctions or whether that is related to what we`re told is a broader investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russian government while the Russian government was trying to influence the outcome of our presidential election, we don`t yet know. But the other matter here is that if Flynn as a private citizen before he was sworn in, became national security adviser if while the Obama administration was in office he was communicating with a foreign government to undermine the Obama administration`s stance on sanctions or anything else toward Russia, that would violate federal law in terms of private citizens essentially undermining the foreign policy of the United States. So, again, this is just broken from “The Washington Post” and more on this I imagine over the course of the evening. But we`ll post in at our blog at MaddowBlog.com if you haven`t seen it yet. That does it for us tonight. We will see you again tomorrow.

6,MADDOW," And thanks to you at home for joining us at this hour. Yes, I`m in Massachusetts tonight. I wonder why. Yes, I`m very excited about what happened yesterday with the Patriots but I will not let you suffer with me gloating over it. There you have it. All right. We have just heard tonight from a federal appeals court on the West Coast about whether the Trump refugee ban and Muslim ban is going to be allowed to come back to life or whether it will continue to be blocked by a federal judge`s order. That appeals court, the U.S. circuit court for the Ninth Circuit, they set a deadline tonight, a deadline of tonight for the government to make its legal filing to present its best case. Then, moments after that deadline passed, they announced there will be a hearing tomorrow at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time, 3:00 p.m. on the West Coast, 6:00 p.m. on the East Coast. That means this time tomorrow, we will likely know whether the refugee ban and the Muslim ban is still staying dead or if it might come back from beyond the grave. There`s been so much visible protests. There`s been such wide-scale civilian resistance and organizing against Trump, I think it`s been easy to focus on that as the countervailing force against which the Trump administration is pushing, but this legal fight in the Ninth Circuit now this is the first time that the judiciary has really given this new administration a shove and pushed it way back. Again, the big hearing in this case is tomorrow. We just learned tonight that the hearing is going to be live-streamed when it happens, which is going to be fascinating. In just a moment on this show, we`re going to be speaking with the blue state attorney general who brought that case in the first place. We`ll hear from him directly as to what he expects from that hearing tomorrow and where he thinks this very big, very important case is going. So that`s all ahead. While we await that interview tonight, while we await that hearing tomorrow, we have also just had one of the strangest pieces of reporting we have yet had on any subject about this new administration. And that`s what I want to lead the show with tonight. This is not something that the new president tweeted, this is not some, you know, blatantly false and inflammatory thing said in the White House briefing room or said by one of his surrogates. What we`re going to focus on tonight at the top of the show is something that the White House has reportedly done, even though they haven`t talked about it. It`s being reported independently by the “Associated Press” about the administration even though they`ve said nothing about it. And I`m starting to feel like the best way to cover this administration is to treat them like they are a silent movie, right? They`ve got a problem all the way up to the very top of saying stuff that isn`t true and so, that can be every day`s news story, but there`s also responsibility to focus on the bigger stuff that they`re doing, to not be so distracted by the things they say, because that could send you down 40 rabbit holes a day trying to ferret out the connection or lack thereof between the statements of the administration and the reality of the lived world, right? It`s important to catch them on their misstatements and point them out but if you spend all of your time trying to nail down their words following every statement that they make as your next news story, not only do they get to lead you by the nose in terms of what you cover, but sometimes for all of the attention to what they are saying, you miss what they are doing. So, this administration isn`t very old yet. We`re 2 1/2 weeks in. As each day goes by of this new administration, I feel like in terms of developing my understanding of what`s important, explaining what the real stuff is that`s happening, you know, it`s not a distraction of what is really going on, I feel like I`m getting more and more focused of reporting about their behavior rather than focusing on comment or amplification of things that they said. So, I just want to tell that you as a matter of transparency, that`s where I`m coming from on this, that`s where my news sense comes from on this and now, please, check this out. This man is often described as Europe`s last dictator. He has been in power in his country since 1994, 23 years and counting. And one of the ways you know that somebody has gotten comfortable being a dictator is that when he announces he`s given a press conference, what he actually does is then gets up in front of the press and speaks for 7 1/2 hours without notes and without a break and without interruption, 7 1/2 hours. That happened in Belarus on Friday night, 7 1/2 straight hours from the president/dictator of that country. And you know what? In our country, we have had all this furor and all of this protest and all of this ferocious legal argument over the travel ban put in place by our new president. We know what it`s like for a policy like that to cause great disruption, to have great big political consequences. This entrenched dictator, though, Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus, he just one-upped us in his country. What he announced last month is that people from more than 80 countries can now visit Belarus, can now travel to his country without even getting a visa. So, you don`t need any government permission. You don`t need to notify the government that you`re coming. You can just show up. You don`t need a visa. Just be here. You`re fine. Welcome. And the reason this has caused a very specific kind of freak-out over there is just to the immediate east of Belarus, looming over them in everything they do is their giant overbearing neighbor, Russia. And Russia is freaking out about this plan by Belarus that they are going to let in people from all over the world because that is right on Russia`s border. I mean, this new policy in Belarus, it applies to countries from the E.U. countries. They can all come without a visa. It applies to Americans. You can come without a visa now. If Belarus says come on in to people from all of these countries, more than 80 countries around the globe, that would mean that people from all of those countries could just waltz right up to Russia`s border. And so, queue the Russian freak-out. Russia has freaked out about this. They`ve responded by threatening to militarize the border between Russia and Belarus. They are going to let Americans and Europeans and all of these people in, well, we are going to put up barbed wire. Put up barbed wire and those walls back up on the border between us then. Russia has also threatened to cut off the oil and gas supply to Belarus and the president in his 7 1/2 hour press conference, he said that Belarus absolutely could survive that. They would figure out some way around not getting any more oil and gas. Nobody believes that`s necessarily true, that they could survive it, but it shows you that he`s worried. In fact, a lot of what he said that was designed to reassure people that everything was going to be okay ended up doing exactly the opposite. “The Associated Press” today quotes him from hi Friday press conference saying, quote, “There will be no war, no one will occupy us. No one will send in troops.” And I`m sure he meant that to be reassuring but it`s not reassuring to hear that from your country`s leader, right? Don`t worry. There`s not going to be a war. Nobody`s invading us. Scarier words were never spoken. So this is what Russia is – Russia is really leaning on them now. And, you know, this is what Russia does, for a long time, right, since the collapse of the Soviet Union and all of those things that used to be part of the USSR instead of becoming independent countries on the eastern edge of Europe. For a long time, Russia has freaked out about its reach and its influence and its defenses, particularly along its western border. This is what drives them all the time. They feel like they are surrounded by NATO. They feel like they are encroached upon by the European Union. They feel like, you know, countries that ought to be in their orbit, countries that used to be part of the USSR, these countries are constantly being pried off and turned toward the West instead further isolating Russia. And sometimes these concerns turn into war. In recent years, Russia has invaded Georgia. They have invaded Ukraine, and taken over a part of Ukraine to be their own territory now. Countries that Russia wants to stay in its orbit are constantly being threatened by Russia, that they have to stay in Russia`s orbit or else. You like your oil and gas? Want to keep getting it? Shame if something happened to it. When they feel like there`s a country that ought to be in their orbit that is turning towards the West, they also do whatever they can to drive a wedge between those countries and whatever Western influence is so appealing, whether it`s the European Union or the United States or NATO, or what-have-you. And sometimes these things, as they said, they do become war but more often it`s these sub-war level fights and conflicts and simmering weirdo standoffs – and I mean it when I say weirdo because before this fight they are in right now, for example, over people from all over the world being able to go to Belarus without a visa, which Russia is very upset about. Before this fight, there was a big round of tensions between Russia and Belarus because Russia said that Belarus violated its ban on importing Western foods. When the United States and European Union and western countries put sanctions on Russia, Russia retaliated by saying, yes, OK, we`re not going to import any Russian foods anymore and they said that Belarus violated that ban and that was a truly weird one because that was the one where Russia ended up doing all these photo-ops where they burned up big piles of perfectly good food and they drove tanks over boxes of fruit and cheese and made a big show of crushing frozen geese. It was really weird. There was also that time when this was when Russia was pushing to build a military base in Belarus, even though Belarus did not want Russia to build a military base there. It`s always something with these guys. And in the past, to press their advantage, Russia has mostly resorted to threats. That`s what they are best at. But they have also used propaganda and information warfare to try to fight these weirdo fights that they have along its western border. Again, they sometimes become war but they mostly just simmer and become these sub-war level conflicts. For example, not long ago, the Russian state-run media outlet, the propaganda outlet that`s called Sputnik, they floated the idea that Belarus was about to be invaded by the West. They cooked up this fake news story that Belarus was desperate for Russian weapons and Russian protection because Poland – yes, Poland was going to invade Belarus. And that`s insane. Poland is a NATO country. They are an E.U. country. Yes, Poland is as nuts as any country but Poland is not invading Belarus, right? But that`s, of course, the kind of thing that Sputnik would come up with. That`s the kind of nonsense Russian propaganda that Putin pumps out whenever he needs to. This is a, you know, well-positioned propaganda effort design to unsettle people – in this case, designed to rattle the 75 percent of Belarusian citizens who speak Russian. This is Russia`s way of telling them, don`t trust your leaders, don`t trust the West, only Russia can protect you. The west might invade at any minute. Look out, here comes Poland. It`s ridiculous. It`s ham-handed, right? Poland is not going to invade Belarus. But this is what Russia does. And for all the craziness in our politics, I`m glad we don`t have to deal with anything like that, right? So here`s the thing. “The Associated Press” has a story out today on the new administration and how they are having sort of a hard time getting it together on national security and foreign policy stuff. You know, the Muslim ban debacle, the ridiculously botched calls to even friendly foreign leaders, that kind of stuff. There`s a bunch of stories out there today on that subject. But towards the end of the “Associated Press” version of this story, they drop this, quote, “According to one U.S. official, national security aides have sought information about Polish incursions in Belarus, an eyebrow-raising request because little evidence of such activities appears to exist.” And by little evidence of such activities, they mean, yes, no evidence outside bullpucky Russian propaganda designed to freak Belarus out and get Russia`s way into that country. “The “A.P.” reporter who authored this piece clarified a little bit on Twitter saying explicitly that, quote, “It was senior people, senior aides in the Trump administration” who asked for this information on Polish incursions into Belarus – when there have not been polish incursions into Belarus, except in raw ham-handed really obscure propaganda that you wouldn`t stumble upon because it`s been repeated a lot in your Facebook feed, right? You would never come across this except in this raw propaganda that Russia pumps out through its state-run media channels, like freaking RT and Sputnik. That`s the only place where stuff like this is trafficked. Why are senior national security aides from the Trump administration inquiring about it? Hey, top Trump national security officials, hey, General Michael Flynn, national security adviser, what are you guys reading these days? Where are you getting your stuff from? And, General Flynn, while we`re on the subject, is it true that you are rewriting the president`s daily brief from the intelligence community every day because you know better than the U.S. intelligence community? What are your sources? Where are you getting your info from? I mean, this is really strange. This is like – this is like a sitcom where you`re trying to figure out which of your friends have been gossiping about you and so you give all of your friends a different salacious, fake secret and tell them not to tell anyone, and then one of those fake secrets that starts circulating tells you which of your friends has been betraying you and started blabbing your news around school, da, da, da, dada, right? It`s like this is a ridiculous plot except in this case, it`s the National Security Council and the secret to figure out what they are working on is apparently what Russia has been blasting out as ham-handed propaganda that otherwise has no connection to the real world, to real American national security interests or even to real news. I mean, Sputnik TV should not be the Rosetta stone that unlocks the priorities of the National Security Council in the White House. But honestly, what else explains this? I mean, the Russian intervention into our presidential election is still not explained. The Russian – excuse me. The Republican-led intelligence committees in the House and the Senate, they are sort of just waking up, yawning, just thinking about trying to get around to maybe start figuring that out sometime soon, right? They are putting the Russia back into don`t rush me. But as long as that Russian intervention in our election remains unexplained, uninvestigated, unpunished, not to be weird, but that means there`s also an open question of a potential Russian government penetration into the Trump campaign. And into what is now the Trump administration. Poland is not invading Belarus. “The A.P.” is reporting that the top level national security aides to this president are inquiring with U.S. agencies about those Polish incursions into Belarus. Why the heck are they pursuing that as a line of inquiry in the Trump National Security Council? Democrats last week asked for an investigation into payments from one Russian state media outlet, from RT, to our current national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Michael Flynn was reportedly paid a lot of money to attend an RT dinner in Moscow where he sat with Vladimir Putin. That was in December 2015. We`ve got the photos to prove that he was there. At that point, General Flynn had already met repeatedly with presidential candidate Donald Trump. He was soon to endorse Donald Trump and join his campaign. As a recently retired flag officer, Democrats claim it may have been illegal for Michael Flynn to have taken that money from the Russian government for that Moscow appearance, even though he was no longer in uniform when he did so. Democrats have asked for an investigation into that. Maybe that thread will unravel some of this. And maybe the FBI really is investigating ties between the Trump campaign and now, the Trump administration and the Russian government. The FBI, of course, is not confirming or denying whether that investigation exists, but there have been multiple reports have been that it does. Maybe it does exist and maybe that will shed some light. But there is something weird here. And if you tune out what they say and you just watch what they do, this kind of thing stands out. Why the heck are they doing that? Right? I mean, “The New York Times” reports today that President Trump did not know, did not understand, he was not properly briefed on what he was doing when he signed an executive order putting Steve Bannon on the National Security Council. Think about that for a second. What`s worse, the fact that he put Steve Bannon on the National Security Council or that the president did so unknowingly. Somebody is putting things in front of him to sign and he`s signing them without knowing what they are. Which is worse? There`s good reason for all of this focused reporting right on whether or not the Trump administration knows what it`s doing. But sometimes, I think what otherwise feel like random misfires by them or bizarre priorities from them, sometimes those things may not just be evidence of chaos and incompetence. Sometimes, it`s worth tracking those things back to their origins to find out where they are coming from, and in this case, the national security playbook for this administration appears in part to originate in another hemisphere. This is a very creepy development. This needs explaining. We`ll be right back.",1,18222.0,3186.0,host,7.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-06

9,"BOB FERGUSON, WASHINGTON STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL"," Well, let`s put it this way, Rachel. I would not have filed this litigation unless I was confident we would prevail. In a courtroom, it`s not the loudest voice that prevails. It`s the Constitution. And the bottom line is, this executive order is constitutional and we are confident that a judge here in the western district of Washington will agree and we are optimistic will grant that restraining order as well.",1,414.0,72.0,guest,10.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-06
10,MADDOW," That was one week ago today. Washington State`s Attorney General Bob Ferguson on this show expressing confidence that his stay will prevail in its lawsuit against the Trump refugee ban and Muslim ban. And then on Friday night, Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, he did win. The state of Washington at least won the first round Friday night when a federal judge in Seattle granted a temporary restraining order effective nationwide halting the implementation of the Trump ban. Well, now tonight, the federal appeals court for that part of the country has set a hearing for 3:00 p.m. West Coast time tomorrow, 6:00 p.m. East Coast. We`ve also just learned that that hearing is going to be streamed live while it happens. At least until the website of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals inevitably crashes because of fantastic, national, and indeed international demand to hear what`s going to happen in that case and what is either going to go down in history as the first most radical policy of the administration or the first time the federal courts took a look at this new president`s policy agenda and said, no, no way, no how, not as long as we have this constitution. Joining us now is, once again, Bob Ferguson, Washington state attorney general.

13,FERGUSON," I think things are going precisely as we had planned when we set a course to litigate this really fundamental constitutional matter.

Very, very high-powered folks joining on here – 100 tech companies, 16 attorneys general, a lot of very highfalutin national security officials, former national security officials, including the former Secretary of State John Kerry.

We`re talking Microsoft. We`re talking Apple. We`re talking Google. And from the national security standpoint, critics of the lawsuit pointed to that as does the president. But as you mentioned, a bipartisan group of national security experts, including George W. Bush`s CIA director filed affidavit in support of my complaint and motion before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. So, I think it goes to the heart of the case and I think it`s going to speak well for our complaints as we move forward throughout this process.",1,694.0,119.0,guest,16.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-06

Some want to bring their own lawsuits, that`s fantastic. Each has to make their own decisions. But I can tell you that, yes, I anticipate additional states.

If the court tomorrow decides that they`re going to allow the policy to be reinstated, either on a temporary basis or if they acted in a more radical way, would you expect the kind of on-the-ground chaos we saw when the ban first went into effect last weekend?",1,399.0,72.0,host,19.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-06
19,FERGUSON," That`s a good question and hard to predict. I guess what I could say is I`ve seen firsthand the impact. I was out at SeaTac Airport here in Washington with Governor Jay Inslee to greet folks coming from countries like Iran and Somalia to the United States who had been rejected and turned away previously. So, I know how deeply personal these issues are and how strongly the people of my state and folks around the country feel about it. At the end of the day, I`ll use all the tools I have to make sure the Constitution is upheld and to make sure that no one is above the law and that includes and, in fact, especially includes the president of the United States.

23,MADDOW," Do you see these pictures over the weekend? This was Romania over the weekend. Look at that. That is not a celebration. Romania only has about 20 million people. A considerable proportion of those 20 million people turned out in the streets to protest against their government this weekend. What`s going on there is that the head of the leading political party in Romania, he`s banned from being prime minister because he has a corruption conviction and because he`s facing trial on another corruption charge. And to deal with that problem, his ruling party last week went into an emergency session late at night and they passed a law that proclaimed that corruption is no longer a crime. Seriously. They basically decriminalized negligence in office, abuse of power and conflict of interest. They decriminalized corruption. And that night, even though they did it late at night, 10,000 people showed up in the streets that night and then the next night it was more like 100,000 people and then by last night, the fifth straight night, it was hundreds of thousands of people in the streets. It took five days of these massive demonstrations and the government caved. They have now announced that they are rescinding their law that made corruption legal. Protest sometimes works. This is Republican Congressman Tom McClintock trying to have a community meeting in his California district this weekend. This is what it looked like. Tom McClintock facing his constituents. This was Lincoln, Nebraska, constituents unhappy with Republican Senator Deb Fisher demanding that she meet with them and talk about her votes for the Trump cabinet nominees. This was Illinois Republican Congressman Peter Roskam. Look at this crowd that met him at one of his community events this weekend. They are saying meet with us, meet with us. At one point, they switched to 2018, 2018. Not so veiled threat. They said, hey, Peter, we vote. Protest works. Not every time but sometimes protest works. And tonight, a different kind of protest is going to be working all night in Washington, which is all the more remarkable because these are some of the least likely people to stay up working on anything, no offense. You know, but even when they hold a filibuster, U.S. senators don`t usually stay up super late actually talking. Tonight, though, Senate Democrats say they will talk all night long if they have to and it looks like they`ll have to. Democrats are holding the Senate floor overnight tonight to talk about the one cabinet nomination they seem most bent on derailing at the moment, the one where they are closest. Tonight, they are within a single vote of stopping the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be education secretary. Democrats are all opposed to DeVos. A couple of Republicans have pealed off already. Lots of other Republicans have been under tremendous pressure in their home districts and on their Washington phone lines and again today outside the capitol in D.C., lots of Republicans facing pressure to vote no on DeVos. So, Senate Democrats are putting on inside the system pressure to try to get this done, to try to get this nomination blocked. They are now an hour ten of holding the Senate floor. They need just one more Republican to vote “no” on Betsy DeVos and her nomination will be tossed. One vote. That`s all they need. They are that close. Hold that thought. Stay with us.",1,3385.0,576.0,host,24.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-06
24,MADDOW," You are supposed to vet potential high-level nominees in private so they don`t end up getting vetted in public where it counts and tends to stick. For example, the Trump administration`s pick for Army secretary. He`s a former Army Ranger turned trading firm billionaire. His name is Vincent Viola. He got announced as Army secretary, and then up pops the news that he was accused in August of punching someone out at a very fancy highfalutin racehorse auction in Saratoga Springs, New York. This was public information. How come the White House didn`t know about it? Then, it turned out that his financial holdings were so complicated that he says it will be impossible for him to divest from his holdings, which apparently is just fine for presidents these days but not for army secretaries. And so, on Friday, after the close of business, after he had already accepted the nomination weeks and weeks ago, Vince Viola withdrew his name from consideration as Army secretary. Consider also, Andrew Puzder, fast food zillionaire and the president`s pick for labor secretary. And yes, it might be because all kinds of stuff from his past has bubbled to the surface, including old claims about spousal abuse that he and his former wife rebut. But this is stuff buried no deeper than a cursory Googling. He also faces difficulty with divesting from his various interests. His holdings are reportedly complex and it`s taking him a good long while to get his paperwork in order for the ethics check. Tonight, Puzder revealed that he and his wife employed an illegal immigrant in their home for years, news that they have apparently just now revealed to the Trump administration because the Trump administration didn`t figure it out themselves. Did I mention that what he`s nominated for is labor secretary? Puzder has seen his nomination hearing postponed four times now. He still has not a date for hearing. It`s my guess is that he`s never going to get one. There`s also President Trump`s pick for secretary of health and human services, Congressman Tom Price. His nomination has been delayed multiple times over concerns about him having conflicts of interests, him repeatedly buying stock in health-related companies and then writing legislation that boosted the value of the stock of those companies. Congressman Price has denied doing anything improper but the longer Democrats drag this out, the more damaging headlines pile up and they all seem to be sort of of this stripe. His wife is a Georgia state lawmaker. She`s also been accepting campaign donations from health companies during her husband`s pending nomination to be health secretary. Just one of these many conflicts that Tom Price is dragging around would likely have been more than enough to sink anybody else seeking a cabinet position into any other administration. I think the main reason that his nomination might still actually have a chance tomorrow in the Senate is just because there are so many other distracting nominees with terrible problems to tackle, like, for example, Betsy DeVos, the nominee for education secretary. Senate Democrats, as we reported earlier, they are right now holding the floor for a full 24 hours all through the night in opposition to the DeVos nomination. They say she`s unqualified for the job. And after a rigorous confirmation hearing did not go well for her, Democrats have an argument to make about that. If nothing else, she will be forever remembered for plagiarizing some of her written responses to Democratic questions. Did I mention she`s the nominee for education secretary? She will also, of course, be remembered for saying that we should allow guns in schools for, quote, “potential grizzly bears”. Potentially. It`s hard to imagine that the Trump administration expected this kind of public drawn-out embarrassing vetting after they had already supposedly vetted her. But that turns out this new administration is terrible for vetting people for all kinds of jobs at all levels. They might even have turned out to be terrible at vetting their Supreme Court nominee. This is the one they thought was going great. It might not be going great anymore. That`s next.",1,4179.0,694.0,host,25.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-06

Bush nominated him to the federal bench in 2006. And, you know, when you are nominated for a federal appeals court, you get a really good vetting. Being up for an appeals court job is a really big deal, but it is an order of magnitude different to be nominated for a seat on the United States Supreme Court. Did the Trump administration do any additional vetting of Judge Gorsuch above and beyond what the Bush administration did for that appeals court seat 11 years ago? Specifically, was all of this biography accurate? Today, “The Wall Street Journal” reports on that paper`s struggle to corroborate involvement by Judge Gorsuch in these two Harvard volunteer programs. Quote, “Roughly three dozen students who participated in the two programs while Mr. Gorsuch was at Harvard law school from 1988 to 1991 said they had no recollection of his involvement.” “Wall Street Journal” includes quotes from classmates who say things like, quote, “If he was active in the prison legal assistance project, I am sure I would remember him.” “Wall Street Journal” also says that while involvement in the groups was voluntary and only loosely monitored, Judge Gorsuch doesn`t appear, for example, in the yearbook photos of either group, nor is he listed among the members not pictured. Now, the White House has pointed “The Journal” to one person who says judge Gorsuch was involved in one of the programs. This person says this, exactly, I`m just going to read it directly. Quote, “What I am prepared to do is corroborate that Neil Gorsuch was in the Harvard Defenders. I have a specific recollection of talking to him about one case but I don`t want to go into the details. I`d like to leave it there.” He would like to leave it there. Now, to be fair, Judge Gorsuch may very well have been an active participant in both of these big-hearted effective groups at Harvard Law School. For all we know, these were formative experiences for him, just as we have had described to us by the White House. But Democrats are already saying they are going to put up the biggest fight possible against this nomination. Mainly on the grounds that Republicans stole the Supreme Court seat by refusing to consider President Obama`s nominee for the whole last year that he was in office. That has been the framework of the fight so far, but if the nominee also has certain holes or certain questions in his resume, stuff that can`t be corroborated more fully than this and in fact lots of people say he wasn`t there – well, that could change not just the way Democrats wage this fight but it could change the substance that they are fighting on. Joining us now is Dahlia Lithwick, senior editor and legal correspondent for “Slate” magazine. Dahlia, it`s great to see you.

29,MADDOW," So I have been feeling like Judge Gorsuch nomination from the Democratic point of view is mostly going to be a fight about whether or not the Republicans should get away with never giving a hearing to Merrick Garland and holding that seat open for so long, whether it`s okay for Donald Trump to appoint anybody to the seat. Are things changing now with these kinds of questions being raised by “The Wall Street Journal” that there may be a more substantive type of fight over judge Gorsuch himself?",1,499.0,90.0,host,30.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-06
30,LITHWICK," Rachel, I`m going to do something I never do, which is push back a little on this and I think that, you know, this question of, you know, was he in this group or that group and, you know, was this misrepresented? These are the kinds of questions that seem to me really hung up the Alito confirmation hearing. You remember, we had a big fight about whether he was a member of a group at Princeton. I guess I just feel as though the first thing you said is so true, which is this is a referendum on norms, this is a referendum on a stolen seat, and I always feel that these questions about are you a good person as represented by, you know, these handful of behaviors, never goes well. I`ve learned to call it the sort of cardiologic model of confirmation hearings, what`s in your heart, are you a good person, you know, get out the pet scan, get out the cat scan. I don`t find an enormous amount of utility in this inquiry, particularly right at this moment where in addition to the fact that the seat has been stolen, I think we have existential question about presidential powers and whether there can be an independent judiciary that acts as a check on the president. And so, to me while this is interesting and sort of, you know, worth pursuing, boy, I hope this is not the main event at a confirmation hearing that might be the last best chance to talk about an independent judiciary and Donald Trump.",1,1406.0,265.0,guest,31.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-06
31,MADDOW," I`m going to push back on your pushback because we can do that here among friends. The thing that seems interesting to me about this is not – it`s not are you a good – it`s not an are you a good person question. It`s a – is there something false in the biography here? Is there a misrepresentation here? I mean, I do think – I guess I`m a person who, you know, thinks that prison legal assistance is an important and cool thing for lawyers to do, and because providing pro bono assistance to people who can`t afford good lawyers to get Harvard-trained lawyers to help them out I think is a cool thing for lawyers to do. I like hearing that about him. Clearly, the White House likes bragging on that about him. But if they didn`t have those things to say about him, I wouldn`t go looking for him, you know what I mean? It seems like the concern here or the potential concern as the “Wall Street Journal” raised is it there might be something wrong here in terms of the way he`s mischaracterized his own past. Or that the White House might have screwed up the vetting here somehow and that we can`t necessarily trust what they`re telling us about him. Does that – does that nuance at all affect that or still feel like it`s a Merrick Garland discussion, full stop?",1,1263.0,239.0,host,32.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-06

33,MADDOW, Yay.,1,5.0,2.0,host,34.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-06
34,LITHWICK," I think we`re there now. Which is simply I think if we want to be fair, you know I have huge reservations about Judge Gorsuch`s record and how I think he will be Scalia-like in almost every important way, but I do think if we look at his judicial record and we sort of drain out the conversation about what he did or didn`t do at Harvard – I think he`s actually been pretty good on some of these issues of prisoners, on some of these issues of whether the criminal justice system is fair to prisoners. And so, I guess I would just say – again, I stipulate, you`re right, he should be vetting. These questions should be asked. But I actually think heavier on the scale for me is that I actually think he has been very much Scalia in some of these cases, awfully good about sort of downtrodden defendants. I might want to give him that. And like I say, shift the focus back to, do you believe there`s such a thing as a “so-called judge” and do you believe there should be an independent judiciary? Those are the questions that just seems to me this is the hearing to have that conversation. And to dilute it with what seems to me, you know, important but not singularly important conversation about what you did in high school or law school – I don`t know, Rachel, I think this is the one chance to really teach the American public what three branches of government and checks and balances really look like.",1,1406.0,265.0,guest,35.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-06

39,MADDOW," Closing thought tonight. We learned today that the president is close to naming a Silicon Valley investor to run the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, which is in charge of keeping our food safe and making sure among other things that vaccines and drugs are safe and effective. The man who`s in line to lead the FDA is not a doctor, has no medical background, unlike any other FDA director for the last half century. Bu he does have a couple ideas on how to improve the health of all Americans",1,499.0,93.0,host,40.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-06
40,"JIM O`NEILL, MITHRIL CAPITAL MANAGEMENT COO"," In a free market, particularly at Seastead, or any other free market in health care, people will be much healthier as well as wealthier. After I go through a lot of examples, I think I`ll demonstrate why the healthiest societies in 2030 will most likely be on the sea.",1,269.0,50.0,guest,41.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-06
41,MADDOW," Did you say on sea, on the sea in a Seastead? Yes, the man reportedly aligned to head the Food and Drug Administration, he`s been part of a movement to reclaim freedom and liberty by starting new countries on the sea, by tying together like shipping containers and putting them on the ocean then living on them and calling it a country.",1,337.0,63.0,host,42.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-06
42,O`NEILL," In a free market such as a Seastead, people would have much more incentive to keep themselves healthy and fit and eat right and prevent chronic disease. Seasteads offer a great opportunity not just for the people who live on the Seasteads to good efficient care of high quality but also for people who come in specifically for that purpose. In terms of efficiency, and affordability of health care, it was much greater a century ago.",1,434.0,77.0,guest,43.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-06
43,MADDOW," So, shouldn`t we all move out to floating barges on the ocean and then health care can be as efficient and affordable as it was a century ago? It`s a full employment program for leeches. So says the man who is reportedly Donald Trump`s top contender to head the United States` Food Drug and Administration. If a life of freedom and great health care on a libertarian floating country is not enough for you, he`s also pursuing immortality, at least for a select few. Here`s the possible next chief of the FDA giving a speech on how venture capitalists and investors can get us to immortality. We can live forever. If we can only invent good new business models that will make us live forever. He calls it rejuvenation and reverse aging. He said in that same speech that maybe when it comes to pharmaceuticals in this country, maybe we should not have clinical trials for drugs anymore at all. Just put the drugs all out on the open market, let people use them, see what happens and the free market will sort it out. And, yes, of course, that would change decades of policy for how we determine whether drugs are safe and effective. It`s such a radical shift that even a lot of pharmaceutical companies are on record as worried about this guy now being in charge. But honestly, it`s sort of hard for me to focus on that when he`s devoted so much of his time and energy to promoting the creation of independent nations of manmade islands in the sea where we will all live forever. The president has already made a lot of wacky nominations, but apparently he`s just getting started. Peter Thiel apparently referred the guy, so presumably he`s going to be perfect. That does it for us tonight. We`ll see you again tomorrow.

Like even when there`s no reason to think they`ve been drinking – I`m not accused of anybody of drinking on the job – there are some people in public life where there`s just something about them that innately seems a little tipsy, particularly when they`re happy. The best example of this that I know of in American politics is Tommy Thompson. Tommy Thompson, very impressive career in Republican politics. He served 13 years as governor of Wisconsin, the longest-serving governor in that state`s history. He ran Amtrak for a while. He was health and human services secretary in the George W. Bush administration. He`s got a great resume. But I continue to believe the reason he was never taken seriously as a presidential candidate when he finally ran for president is because, no offense, I do not mean this as a personal affront in any way, but there is something about him when he speaks that reads a little tipsy.",1,1043.0,185.0,host,1.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-02

3,MADDOW," Who else would you rather have in charge of America`s nuclear weapons and national labs but our new president picked him. But this problem, he sometimes seems drunk when he`s not actually drunk, problem, it`s not only American phenomenon. In Europe, in the European Union, there`s no exact equivalent for our position of president, there`s no president of Europe but this is Jean-Claude Juncker and he is the president of the European Commission, and that is sort of the closest equivalent to being the president of the United States of Europe and he, too, has this same problem. He, too has this “seems drunk when he`s not” problem. Jean-Claude Juncker is the former president of Luxembourg. It`s possible everybody in Luxembourg is like this. I don`t have any reason to know that. I don`t think so. But what`s clear is that he enjoys his work as president of the European Commission. He maybe enjoys it too much. Also when he`s happy and in a good mood, he likes to slap people. Here he is shaking a politician`s hand at a big E.U. summit in Latvia. It`s all very normal until slap. Here you go, ready? He smacks him upside the head. Whack! Here he is walking up to another man. He slaps him, too. Why not? I`m the president of Europe. Smack you upside your head. The president of the European Commission also likes to compare ties. Here he`s tie touching with one gentleman. Here he is with another foreign leader doing the same thing. This is the E.U. Summit that happened in Latvia last year. Everybody had the same idea about what kind of tie to wear. He didn`t let them forget it. But it`s this next interaction I want you to watch.

5,MADDOW," “The dictator is coming.” Whap! And then he slaps the dictator upside the head. The man the president of the European Commission is calling a dictator in that video is Viktor Orban. Viktor Orban is the prime minister of Hungary. And when they march against him in the streets of Hungary, they actually call him not the dictator, they call him the victator because his name was Viktor. When Viktor Orban was a young man in the late 1980s, he started an anti-communist movement in his country. By the time he was 35 years old, he was the youngest every prime minister of his country. He was elected prime minister when he was 35 years old in 1998. But it`s interesting, he only served one term. He lost in the next election and that apparently made an impression on him. He apparently decided that not only would he come back to power someday in his country, but if and when he got a second shot at power in his country, he would not want to lose that power maybe ever again. And Viktor Orban did get another shot. He won election as prime minister again in 2010. He won a big victory. His party won two-thirds of the seats in parliament. And with that huge majority, with that power, they decided they would to rewrite the rules. They rewrote the Constitution. Among other things, they cut in half the number of seats in the parliament. They redrew the boundaries of all the election districts in the country all at once. Viktor Orban said the old system was too way too complicated. This new way that he and his party had come up with, it was way simpler. It was also designed to make it basically impossible to remove him and his party from power. And in the next elections, in 2014, support for Viktor Orban`s party shrunk dramatically. They`ve got a lot fewer votes. They dropped from 53 percent of the vote down to 44 percent of the vote, but wouldn`t you know it, thanks to these new simpler rules, even though Viktor Orban`s party got less sport and fewer votes, they kept the same seats. They held on to the same two-thirds majority in parliament. Magic thanks to the simplification of the rules that they rammed through and that only benefitted his party. He also changed the legal supervision of national elections in his country. So, instead of an election commission with representatives from all the parties, now, it`s just run from – by seven guys from Viktor Orban`s own party who oversee the elections. And he`s done all of these other things that we now know to watch for in circumstances like this, right? I mean, you know basic political science, you know what creeping authoritarianism looks like. Doesn`t matter how you got there in the first place, we know what it looks like when you consolidate power so you never leave. He has clamped down on and punished media outlets that are critical of him. He has bolstered and given governments support to media athletes who toe his line if you say nice things about him. He`s had senior members of opposition parties arrested. Tax evasion is always a convenient charge for that. He has ousted independent judges. He`s packed the courts with his loyalists. He tried to get away with a big new voter registration requirement that his country had never had before. You have to submit paperwork and sign up with the government in the way you never had to do in that country before. Observers said that that requirement would guarantee people likely to vote against him just wouldn`t be allowed to vote. In that case, trying to institute new documentation requirements for voting. In that case, what`s left of the independent judiciary was able to shut that part down for now, but they tried. He`s also thrilled his right wing populist supporters by inveighing against refugees and immigrants, and he has also built a wall along his country`s southern border. And so, yeah, they call him the victator. Or if you`re the pleasantly drunk seeming European president, you can just go straight to call him the dictator, before you smack him upside the head. Hungary is part of Europe. They have gone along with the European side of the sanctions that the United States government organized against Russia in 2014. But now, Viktor Orban is looking at Vladimir Putin seeing a kindred spirit and thinking maybe, we`re not going to go along with those sanctions anymore. Viktor Orban sent his foreign minister to Moscow last week and in Moscow last week, his foreign minister declared that those sanctions on Russia may now be counterproductive. So, now, maybe the European part of the worldwide sanctions on Russia that we organized, maybe those sanctions are going to start falling apart. Thank you, Viktator. Today, Russian President Vladimir Putin took his first foreign trip of the Trump era, the Trump era the Russian government has been so excited about. Naturally, when Vladimir Putin decided to go abroad for the first time in the Trump era, he went to go see the Viktator, he went to see Viktor Orban in Hungary. This is his first trip abroad since Donald Trump has been president of the United States. And I think part of that is, you know, nationalist, right wing, authoritarian, strong men, dissent crushing would-be leaders for life, those kinds of leaders tend to like each other. But part of that is also the unraveling of this international tool that we led the West in using against Russia, right, the sanctions regime may be falling apart if Putin can pick off individual members, especially on the European side, get them to stop supporting it. So, that may be part of it, too. Part of it broadly is Russia trying to peel Europe apart, you know? Russia would much rather go back to having countries like Hungary in its orbit. Russia doesn`t want NATO. Hungary is in NATO. Russia would prefer that they weren`t. Russia would prefer that NATO broke up. Russia doesn`t want a European Union. Russia doesn`t want an international order where the United States is the leader of the West and the international order that stands up to Russia when Russia does things like murder their dissidents and invade other countries and steal other countries` land, right? So, Russia`s interests are clear. And this trip today, Putin leaves the country for the first time since Donald Trump is president, this trip to Hungary, it`s a nice clear-as-a-bell, geopolitical signal, right, geopolitical move to welcome us to the Trump era. The Trump era where Russia starts expanding its influence on its Western borders again and, frankly, when they want to take something, they just take it. We`re going to talk this hour about a little bit of the – some of the – I don`t know, hairy stuff that`s going on in American national security right now? CNN is citing a White House source today saying President Trump might have hung up on the Australian prime minister a couple of days ago and started a major diplomatic incident with that country, with our close ally because he was, quote, “feeling some fatigue” after having other phone call with other foreign leaders earlier in that day. To clean up after that mess that`s already under way with other politicians including Senator John McCain reportedly calling the Australian government to smooth things other. It`s reportedly the president`s son-in-law, 35-year-old Jared Kushner, the man on the right there, who`s been tasked with cleaning up the other diplomatic mess the president just made with Mexico. The White House now says President Trump was only speaking lightheartedly when he threatened to send U.S. troops to invade Mexico in his conversation with the Mexican president this weekend. Maybe even more worrying than Jared Kushner being sent to clean that up is the news today that that same son in law, this 35-year-old real estate investor was also directly involved in the decision to launch the disastrous special operations raid in Yemen this weekend which killed a Navy SEAL and wounded three others and which the Pentagon now says also killed numerous Yemeni civilians, including, they believe, children. They apparently in the White House they did not make the call on launching that raid from the Situation Room with an assembled formal national security team weighing the hard calls and the complexities. We know what that kind of night looks like in the White House, right? We know what that looks like. No, the Yemen raid, was disastrous and ultimately fatal, Yemen raid was apparently signed off on over dinner with Jared and Steve Bannon from Breitbart News. So, we`re going to have more on that ahead tonight. But there`s also one now thing that I want to stick a pin in tonight, it is under way right now. It is extremely urgent. It`s something that has happened exactly this way once before in recent memory. We know how the previous government, how the Obama administration handled it. But, tonight, we have absolutely no idea how this new administration is going to deal with this circumstance. And looking at the circumstances around this, I think there`s reason to worry. And I don`t say this that often but this is also a circumstance that is literally life or death. Two years ago, almost exactly, February, 2015, there were protests in Russia that were genuinely threatening to Vladimir Putin. Now, all protests threaten somebody like Vladimir Putin to a certain extent, right? Authoritarians don`t like dissent of any kind. But these ones two years ago, they were particularly scary and threatening to Putin because they were led by a credible, viable, well-liked, high-profile opposition political leader, a real political threat who was a former deputy prime minister of the country, known nationwide, very popular, very charismatic, very credible. His name was Boris Nemtsov. And if you remember that name at all, you might remember how this ends. This is Boris Nemtsov in happier times and I`m going to show you a slightly disturbing image here, I`m sorry, there`s your warning – this is the same man, Boris Nemtsov, murdered. And in the pictures here of the site of his murder, you can see the Kremlin in the background. His murder was a Friday night in Moscow. He was due to lead a major protest march – can we go back to that first picture there? Can we go back to the first – all right. This was a Friday night, you can see the Kremlin in the background there, there you go. Stop that picture there. Thank you. That is Boris Nemtsov there on the ground. Nemtsov was due to lead a major protest march against Vladimir Putin and government corruption in Russia the day after this happened. This was late Friday night. He was 100 yards from the Kremlin. He was walking on that sidewalk with a friend, car drove up, guys jumped out, bang, four shots. They killed him there on the street 100 yards outside the Kremlin. This is the leading opposition politician in Russia at the time, a genuine threat to Vladimir Putin. They killed him on the street right outside the Kremlin the night before he was going to lead an opposition rally in Moscow. That was Boris Nemtsov. And then, three months after that in 2015, in May of 2015, they tried to do it to his deputy, too. The deputy in his opposition party was a former journalist, fluent English speaker, worked in the United States for years, his wife and children live in Virginia, in Centerville, Virginia. He traveled back and forth between Virginia, between the D.C. area and Moscow and three months after they shot Boris Nemtsov dead, shot him cold in the streets outside the Kremlin, they tried to get his deputy, too, and they tried to get him with poison. Quote, “Midway through a meeting with fellow dissidents, beads of sweat explicably dotted his forehead, his stomach churned.” He later recalled, quote, “It all went so fast in a space of above 20 minutes, I went from feeling completely normal to having a rapid heart rate, high blood pressure to sweating and vomiting all over the place and then I lost consciousness.” Doctors later told him he had been poison. The poison threw him into a week-long coma with a puzzling range of symptoms, swelling in his brain, kidney failure, his legs and arms turned blue. He had multiple organ failure. He barely survived. He was in and out of a coma. He was 33 years old. And he was a U.S. green card holder. He also held dual citizenship in Britain as well as Russia and the British government, because he had British citizenship, they were able to help directly as best they could, they were able to keep the pressure on in terms of his medical care and the diagnosis of what had almost killed him. His wife and kids in Virginia did everything they could to raise the alarm about this attempted assassination to try to keep him alive, to try to save him. And high level people in the U.S. State Department were reportedly deeply involved as well basically trying to stop what appeared to be an assassination in progress. Deputy Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, the assistant secretary of state for the region, Victoria Nuland, the senior director for Russia at the National Security Council, when the guy got poisoned in Russia, when another opponent of Vladimir Putin turned up mysteriously almost dead this time two years ago, the U.S. State Department was on it and they finally got him out of Russia in July. When they got him out of Russia he still needed to be hospitalized. They got him to the United States, they had him hospitalized for further weeks at a place in Virginia. He basically had to learn to walk again. Did I mention he was 33 years old when this happened? But he did survive. That was two years ago. And now today, literally, this morning, it appears they may have gotten him again. He was back in Russia, he was screening documentaries about the life and assassination of Boris Nemtsov and he collapsed again, same M.O., sudden unexplained collapse and now multiple organ failure. Same thing that happened to him two years ago with what doctors say was an untraceable poison. We reported a couple of weeks ago on this show on two senior Russian intelligence sources being arrested, one of them getting dragged out of an FSB meeting with a big over his head. It`s been widely reported the two Russian officials and others are being charged with treason specifically for leaking information to the U.S. government. Even more specifically, they`re being charged with treason for leaking information to the CIA. If that`s true, if that`s what`s happening, then the Russian government clearly is taking this moment to wrap up what it believes are American sources inside Russia. If this is a second assassination attempt on this leading opposition figure then Putin`s government is also taking this moment to resume knocking off some of its opposition figures. Even ones with family in the United States where the U.S. State Department weighed in to help him the last time he was almost killed. Putin is taking this moment. And why not? It`s a new day. It`s a new era as Viktor Orban and Vladimir Putin proclaimed in their friendly meeting today. It`s a new world. The American government just got our new secretary of state today. Here he is accepting the order of friendship award from Vladimir Putin in person a few years ago. Now that he is the American secretary of state, here`s my question: is he going to help in this case? If Putin tried to kill this guy for a second time today, do we help this guy today? Do we try to keep him alive? Do we make the kind of intervention and get involved the way we did two years ago when it seems like they tried to kill him the first time? I mean, open question this time, right? But tick-tock. He`s in intensive care. He`s on a ventilator. Right now, he`s still in a hospital in Russia. Tick-tock, it`s a new era. What do we do now?",1,15744.0,2752.0,host,6.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-02
6,"VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA, RUSSIAN OPPOSITION POLITICIAN"," I can also speak to the dangers that face opposition activists in Russia from personal experience. Exactly one year ago in Moscow, I fell into a coma as a result of severe poisoning that led to multiple organ failure that was certainly intended to kill. In fact, doctors told my wife who is here today that they estimated the chance of survival around 5 percent. So I`m very fortunate and certainly very happy to be here today and to be speaking and to be testifying before you.",1,479.0,88.0,guest,7.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-02
7,MADDOW," Vladimir Putin was visiting with Hungary`s right wing populist leader today Viktor Orban, nickname the Viktator. One of Vladimir Putin`s fiercest critics was once again lying in a hospital, on a ventilator, in total organ failure in what sure looks like a repeat of what happened to him two years which you saw him testifying about in Congress, when he was the victim of a suspected poisoning by Russian state sources. His name is Vladimir Kara-Murza. Meanwhile, today, the U.S. just got a new secretary of state, one who accepted the Order of Friendship award from Vladimir Putin just a few years ago. If President Putin did just again, just today, tried again today to kill one of his critics, one with ties to the United States, one who lives here with his family, one who we have helped before the last time he was apparently almost assassinated in Russia, how are we going to respond to it now that it apparently has happened again today? What happens now? Joining us now is Michael McFaul. He`s a former U.S. ambassador to Russia and a professor at Stanford University. Mr. Ambassador, it`s nice to have you with us again tonight.

10,MCFAUL," Yes, I know him. I know him personally. I`ve known him for a long time. I saw him recently and I just want to thank you, too, for bringing up the news, reminding people of what happened to another Russian friend of mine, Boris Nemtsov. It was important for people to understand what happened to these people. He was poisoned. I`ve talked to him after that. There`s no doubt in his mind it was for political reasons. He thought it was for assassination and today, I`ve been in touch with many of his friends in Russia and they believe this is a repeat to try to kill him.",1,571.0,109.0,guest,11.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-02
11,MADDOW," He is an American green card holder. His wife and children live in Virginia. He worked for many years in the United States as a journalist. He has been involved in advocating for various Russia-specific policies in our country, including sanctions and anti-corruption measures that the United States has pursued to try to get Russia in line with international norms. When he was hurt two years ago, when there was this what appears to be an assassination attempt on him two years ago I have read reported that the U.S. State Department basically did everything they could. That the British government got involved because of his dual citizenship but the U.S. government also helped and he was ultimately able to recover at a U.S. hospital. Is that fair to describe?",1,766.0,131.0,host,12.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-02
12,MCFAUL," Yes, that`s exactly right. I mean, I saw him after that. I saw him here in San Francisco not long after he recovered and he was very grateful for the help that he got. And he was also, of course very nervous about what the future might hold. I`ll tell you honestly, I told him not to go back to Russia and he told me that he had to, in large part because of what he wanted to do to keep the struggle for democracy and human rights. By the way, Rachel, he`s also a former journalist, an independent journalist before he became a political opposition figure. But he need to do that because his close friend Boris Nemtsov had died and I believe he was on tour – there`s a new movie playing, a new documentary about Boris Nemtsov that`s being played around Russia right now and he was part of that tour. At least a couple days ago, I know that to be true.",1,852.0,167.0,guest,13.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-02
13,MADDOW," I have read that today as well. That`s how his wife described what he was doing. He was traveling around Russia doing screenings of the documentary about his friend who was also assassinated. Do you – obviously, we`ve got a new secretary of state as of today. We`ve got a new administration with radically different ideas about the world and particularly about Russia that it`s in its early days of settling in in Washington. Do you expect the U.S. will keep supporting people like your friends? Like this young man now going through another life threatening ordeal? Do you expect the U.S. government will still intervene in life or death consequences?",1,653.0,112.0,host,14.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-02
14,MCFAUL," Well, what I want and expect are two different things. It`s clear what I want. It`s too early to tell, to be honest. I don`t know what to expect. This is a real test for Secretary of State Tillerson. Everybody was worried in the hearings and discussion about him as secretary of state. The one thing everybody worried about, would he speak up for activists, would he speak up for democracy and human rights? He`s got a test right in his inbox as he settles into the job. The second thing I would say is they seem confused about their Russia policy, because on the one hand, you`ve heard the nice kind words candidate Trump, President-elect Trump said and after the phone call what President Trump said with respect to Mr. Putin, but his ambassador at the United Nations today rightfully, in my opinion, was criticizing the escalation of the war in eastern Ukraine. So, I think they`re rather confused about their Russian policy, and therefore, it`s too early to predict where it`s going to go.",1,994.0,177.0,guest,15.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-02

20,MADDOW," Two months ago, a U.S. Navy Seahawk helicopter was escorting an aircraft carrier out of the Persian Gulf, when it had what the Navy described as a, quote, “unsafe and unprofessional encounter with an Iranian boat, an Iranian patrol boat.” And we`re told that Iranian patrol boat trained a weapon on the U.S. helicopter. A few months before that, Iranian patrol boats raced full speed right at an American Navy vessel. They got so close the American ship fired three warning shots at the Iranian boats. And, of course, 2016 started off with these harrowing images of 10 American sailors being taken into Iranian custody. They were held in Iran for 15 hours before finally being released but not before Iran got plenty of propaganda value out of parading these U.S. sailors before the cameras. And those were just the major incidents. In all, the U.S. Navy says it counts 23 provocative incidents by Iran in 2015 and 35 last year. And one reason Iran is able to do this kind of stuff is simply geographic opportunity. The U.S. has lots of military personnel on Iran`s doorstep in every direction. We have major American deployments in Afghanistan which borders Iran and also Iraq which borders Iran. We have thousands of troops in lots of Iran`s other neighbors, our Navy`s Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain, right across the Persian Gulf from Iran. That would be the Persia of Persian Gulf. But when the new U.S. national security advisor took to the podium on the White House briefing room yesterday and said that the administration was, quote, “putting Iran on notice,” when the White House press secretary followed that up by saying about Iran, quote, “we are not going to sit by and not act on their actions.” We`re not going to not act. When the White House yesterday surprised everybody by threatening Iran with something but we don`t know what nobody gave the U.S. military stationed all over Iran`s backyard nobody gave the U.S. military in the region a heads up. A spokesperson for the U.S. Central Command in the Middle East told “The Guardian” newspaper they had no heads up whatsoever that the White House was about to threaten Iran from the podium in the White House briefing room. They heard about it just like all the rest of us did, when it happened, despite the fact that they`re actually there. They`re the ones right there in easy reach of Iran and its military. A spokesman for CentCom told “The Guardian” last night, quote, “We saw the statement as well. We`re waiting for something to come down the line. We have not been asked to change anything operationally in the region.” Which means before the threat, they weren`t taking any like force protection measures, they weren`t moving anywhere to make sure they were in a defensible position, you know, nothing special. The Iranian military is belligerent and aggressive with our military forces in their region on a good day and it`s a big deal to be threatening any country like that, but particularly Iran when we do have them surrounded by our troops and you`re not even going to give our military force protection to know this is coming in case Iran reacts to this threat? Which is not hard to imagine? It`s just wildly reckless toward American lives and American interests. It suggests there`s something very wrong with how this White House is making national security decisions out of the gate and we can be very specific about that. Hold that thought. That`s coming up.",1,3446.0,598.0,host,21.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-02

But every single day, he does receive the PDB, and then I think on top of that, he`s receiving intelligence briefings from his team. He does get the PDB every day.",1,530.0,88.0,guest,23.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-02

25,MADDOW," The PBD, BBD, the PCP, the BLT, you know, the PB&J, he gets the MRI, whatever, OK? It`s the PDB. What do you think PDB stands for?

26,SPICER," This briefing, the PBD, is raw data, that the intel committee provides to him and it is truly just that, it is raw data. He then receives everyday a security update from his national security team. That is more of a – analysis of that data and intelligence and recommendation on policies that he might want to consider. When he sits down for the PBD, the intel community`s goal and responsibility is only to provide raw data and let the NSC team and the president-elect make their – draw their own conclusions and analysis from that data.",1,539.0,98.0,guest,27.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-02
27,MADDOW," When they remember that it`s called a PDB, and I think maybe he was still saying PBD there. I don`t know. The White House has been trotting out this line, whether or not they know what they`re talking about in terms of the acronym, they`ve been trotting out this line basically that the presidential daily brief is not that important because it`s sort of just stuff that doesn`t make sense, right? It`s just raw data. It`s just, you know, numbers and letters. That`s not true about the presidential daily brief. We looked into this question specifically. We talked to David Priess, who`s a former CIA officer. He`s a PDB expert. He literally wrote a book on the presidential daily brief. He used to write personally the component articles that went inside the presidential daily brief. He told us, quote, “The president`s daily brief does not consist solely of raw data. Primarily, the PDB offers the president the intelligence community`s experts` assessment of various foreign developments. A president may choose to have raw intelligence reports including in his PDB package, but the core articles in the PDB have long been analytic assessments, not merely raw data.” So when the White House says it`s just raw data, no. The PDB, the PB&J, the BLT, the BVD, it`s not just raw data. And it`s a big deal that the president get this intelligence briefing everyday, they produce it for a reason. You know, and for them to be wrong about the acronyms, for them to be wrong about what the major daily product of the intelligence community for the president`s – for them to be wrong about that stuff is worrying on its face, but there`s a larger point to this. Their explanation for why the president doesn`t need this daily intelligence briefing is because it`s just raw data, it`s nothing that he can really use, and besides, he`s got this guy, and this is the guy who makes sense of the intelligence world for the president. This General Mike Flynn, the national security advisor. He, the White House keeps telling us, he is the one who briefs the president everyday. He tells the president what the president needs to know. Forget the briefers from the intelligence community. It`s Mike Flynn. He`s the one who explains stuff to the president. Now, for any number of long time even conservative old hands at foreign policy, Mike Flynn has been a very worrying choice to be national security advisor. But the president picked him and he does now sit at the head of the National Security Council, that`s the structure in place now. And as this presidency itself starts to unfold we are discovering more and more everyday about how it works. I`m not sure it`s making anybody feel better when it comes to national security. Over the weekend, we got news of that raid on an al Qaeda compound in Yemen. This was president Trump`s first counterterrorism operation that he green lit as president, the “New York Times” reports today that it was basically a disaster from start to finish. Obviously, one American Navy SEAL was killed, three additional U.S. service members were wounded. A number of civilians were killed, including CentCom now says they believe children. But when it came time for the president to make the call about whether or not the – this mission was worth its risks, whether the United States government understood the risks well enough and the potential benefits well enough to order that mission, when it came time to decide whether to send these elite American troops into harm`s way, the president`s first real life-or-death decision, he did ask for some help. Again, “The New York Times” reports today they didn`t go to the Situation Room, they sat down at the president`s dinner table and sitting at the dinner table with him when he authorized this disastrous raid this weekend along with the defense secretary and the head of the joint chiefs of staff he had General Flynn. He also had Steve Bannon, his chief strategist, sort of ideological counselor whose most recent credential is running a right wing website, he, of course, was given a permanent seat at the National Security Council. Also at the dinner table making this life or death call was reportedly Jared Kushner, the president`s son-in-law who before joining the White House was a real estate mogul who inherited a lot of properties in the tri-state area from his dad. That`s who was with the president as he made this decision about whether or not the authorize this raid in Yemen over the weekend. Today, reporting on how that all played out, “The New York Times” described it this way, quote, “almost everything that could go wrong did go wrong.” Joining us now is David Sanger. He`s national security correspondent for the “New York Times” and one of the authors of “The Times” piece on what went wrong with the raid in Yemen. Mr. Sanger, it`s nice to have you here. Thanks for being here tonight.",1,4886.0,845.0,host,28.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-02

29,MADDOW," For the – for us to understand the accountability chain here, obviously this is something where under the Obama administration, the initial planning had already started. There had been weeks if not months of planning around the possibilities of this raid. But it was ultimately the Trump administration, including the president himself, who made the call that this should go ahead?",1,382.0,62.0,host,30.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-02
30,SANGER," That`s right. And from everything we can understand, President Obama never actually authorized this one in the end. It had been sent over to the NSC by Ash Carter, the secretary of defense under President Obama. But in the end, partly because the Pentagon wanted to do this raid on a moonless night and there wasn`t one left while President Obama would be in office, he did not approve it. But I think it also appears as if he had some significant reservations because there was a lot in the package of options about what could go wrong and so there were a number of reasons to do this. And so, there are reasons presidents choose drone strikes and drone strikes are controversial for their own reasons and for some very good reasons, but when you do a raid like this, you`re putting a lot of Americans at risk and then, of course, you`re putting the possibility of civilians at risk. And in this case, someone heard them coming and certainly they ran into far more of a firefight than they expected for something where they were just trying to grab computers, cell phones and we don`t know yet whether the – whether they got much intelligence out of this.",1,1157.0,211.0,guest,31.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-02
31,MADDOW," In terms of the difference and the planning around risks and benefits around a rare ground operation like this versus air strikes, versus use thing drones. Obviously, one of the things that`s remarkable about this raid is that there have been so few raids like this in Yemen. We`ve been involved militarily in Yemen doing counterterrorism work, having special operations forces based there or near there, doing drone strikes for a very long time now, for years now. But this is only as far as we know the third ground operation like this. Is part of the calculation on that, whether or not you`re going to upset the domestic government? Obviously, the Yemeni government has its own problems and they`re involved in that civil war, they`ve got a lot of things going on. But do they actually find it easier to accept for domestic purposes an air strike than they do that there are American troops on the ground, not only in harms way themselves but killing Yemeni citizens and dying themselves on Yemeni soil?",1,1008.0,176.0,host,32.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-02
32,SANGER," In this case, there were American troops from the ground, and there were troops in the UAE that joined, that`s another thing that made this an unusual kind of strike. I think there are two issues here. One is the question of sovereignty, admitting that you have foreigners there, in a failed state like Yemen that`s hard. If you go back into the WikiLeaks documents from 2010, you`ll find an exchange – a great exchange General David Petraeus had with the head of Yemen at the time, that – in which the Yemenis wanted to say, let`s say it was our drones, as if Yemen had drones, right? So, yes, that`s sensitive. But the bigger issue is this – if you get into a ground fight like this one and you end up killing civilians as it appeared happened, quite tragically, including some children, you`re adding to the narrative that the al Qaeda forces there have of these Americans who drop from the sky and kill people in a village. And, you know, when the story is told there, the part about the al Qaeda leaders who were there or the part about the intelligence you recover is likely to be left out. So, you have to go do that question that Donald Rumsfeld used to ask, which is, are we creating terrorists faster than we`re killing them? And that`s certainly a risk when you`re doing this.",1,1288.0,238.0,guest,33.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-02

37,MADDOW," For weeks now, Republican Congresswoman Barbara Comstock`s constituents in Virginia have been bombarding her office with request for a town hall. Last week, her office sent out an invitation. If constituents had questions, they should join the congresswoman at her mobile office hours she`d be holding in town. Success. Constituents showed up in big numbers. But their congresswoman didn`t show up. Her office said it wasn`t an error on the invitation. They swear she was never going to be there in the first place. So, now, cue the embarrassing headlines about Barbara Comstock standing up her constituents. This week in Arkansas, members of an Indivisible group scheduled a meeting with Senator Cotton`s staff was scheduled for Wednesday morning in their Little Rock office. They were going to talk about Obamacare and cabinet. But the night before, Senator Cotton`s staff called them and canceled with no explanation. And today, another group showed up to try to meet with Senator Cotton`s staff. His wouldn`t let them inside the door. They explained through an intercom that not only would there be no meeting, they couldn`t even let them past the door, quote, “because of recent threats.” This story was heavily reported in the local press. Throughout the day, protesters showing up outside Tom Cotton`s office. And then, hey, look what happened, pressure works. Indivisible Ozark, the Indivisible chapter in that part of Arkansas says Senator Cotton called them personally, and apologized for the cancelled meeting, and told them he will hold an actual, real life in-person town hall event sometime this month. The pressure got them that far. Town hall events have been sort of touch and go for lawmakers recently in both parties. But we might be getting a new one on the schedule soon from Senator Cotton, thanks to his constituents who would not give up. And a local press who covered their efforts. Who wants to go next?

0,"RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC ANCHOR"," And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. Happy to have you with us. On Friday night, Friday night into Saturday, there was a clerk working the overnight shift at a 24-hour gas station in Victoria, Texas. Victoria, Texas, is 100 miles southwest of Houston. It`s a city of about 60,000 people. At that gas station, at around 2:00 a.m., the clerk who was working the third shift that night saw something bad. Saw smoke and flames billowing out of this building down the street from the gas station. The clerk saw the fire, called 911. The fire department came, but it was too late. The building that was on fire was the local mosque. In Victoria, Texas, it had been set on fire. The fire is now under investigation. By the time the fire department got there and was pouring water on the flames, by the time members of the congregation had called each other and gone to each other`s homes and woken each other up and rushed down to the side of their mosque to see if they could help, by the time that alert was raised, there was nothing anybody could do. Members of the congregation stood on the sidewalk and was watched their house of worship burn all the way to the ground. It was a total loss. When the fire was finally put out, they prayed together. Saturday morning, a few dozen members of the congregation held their first prayers of the day outside on the curb across the street from the burned out shell of their mosque. That fire started late on Friday night. Started actually just a few hours after the new president signed his executive order banning people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from coming to the United States. That was Friday night into Saturday. On Sunday, of course, there was the horrific mass shooting at another mosque in Quebec City in Canada. Six people were killed in the Quebec City attack. Eight more people were wounded. Canadian police do have a suspect in custody in that attack unlike the Texas attack. In Canada, it`s a young man, a 27-year-old man, French Canadian known for his outspoken right wing and anti-Islam politics. He reportedly called police himself and told police he would wait for them to come arrest him. Canada is still reeling from that attack this weekend. There have been repeated demonstrations of public support for Muslim Canadians, including by Canadian public officials. One interesting reverberation of that Canadian attack in our country is that here in our country, the conservative FOX News Channel, they sent out a number of tweets and made a number of claims on the air that the suspected shooter in that attack was a Muslim. He was not. The Canadian prime minister reportedly appealed directly to the president of FOX News and asked the president to take those tweets down and belatedly, FOX News did that. In the Victoria, Texas, mosque fire which again happened one day before the shooting in Canada, they don`t have a suspect in custody. They don`t know who did it. But there has also been a big public show of support. One local resident set up a Go Fund Me page to help the congregation rebuild. That Go Fund Me page raised more than $900,000 in the first two days that it was live. Actually, I just checked tonight before we went on the air, it`s well up over a million dollars now. That Go Fund Me page is filled with people offering to do carpentry, to donate new prayer rugs and for an in-kind donation that only another religious congregation could offer, the leaders of the one Jewish congregation in Victoria, Texas, in that town, they apparently went to the home of the imam from the burned out mosque and handed him the keys to the synagogue. The president of the synagogue sort of played down the offer when reporters called asking about it, basically said it`s what anybody would have done and besides, he explained, they have the space. Quoting him, quote, “We have probably 25 to 30 Jewish people in Victoria. They probably have 100 Muslims. We`ve got a lot of building for a small amount of Jews.” That gesture of support is not a stand alone thing, not even if for Texas. This is a very interesting story. Every two years, at the state capital in Texas, they do something called Texas Muslim Capital Day. They have been doing this every two years for the last 15 years or so. It`s basically a big civics day. Muslims from all over Texas, mostly students, high school kids and even younger kids, they come to the capital for like a – it`s not really a lobby day but they come while the state legislature is meeting and they do workshops and learn about civics and they meet with their legislators and they learn about how the state government operates. It`s a very earnest civic thing they do every two years in Texas. But the last time they did one of these in 2015, it got really ugly. This group of mostly kids stood on the capital steps and recited the pledge of allegiance and sang the national anthem and held a press conference about what they were doing there at the state legislature that day and in 2015, that Texas state capital Muslim day, there was a group of screaming protesters who showed up not just to denounce these Muslims being at the state capital but to disrupt what they were doing. We reported on it at the time. These guys showed up with signs that said, “Go home and take Obama with you.” “I am the infidel Allah warned you about.” “Radical Islam is the new Nazi.” “I serve a risen savior Jesus Christ, Mohammed is dead.” “Mohammed is dead” is one of the things these protesters chanted also at these Muslim school kids who were there at the state capital that day for their civics lesson in Texas. Again, this happened at the state capital in Texas in 2015 and we covered that event in part when it happened in 2015 because of this moment when one of the protesters couldn`t contain herself anymore to just screaming at the kids and instead she took over their podium, took over their microphone.",1,5933.0,1068.0,host,1.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-01

3,MADDOW," That`s what happened two years ago at the Texas Capital Muslim Day. After that woman did that, she and her fellow protesters then resumed their chants at the Muslim school kids over there, and they chanted at them “Mohammed is dead, Mohammed is dead.” That is how Texas Muslim Capital Day went the last time they did it two years ago. This year, it did not happen that way. This year check it out. That did not happen again. There were a couple of the “we hate Muslims”, “we hate Islam” protesters there again this year, but you really couldn`t find them among not just the American Muslims, the Texas Muslims who turned out for Muslim Texas Capital Day, you couldn`t find the screaming anti-Muslim people in the crowd this year, because there was only a couple of them and because of the huge human chain that made themselves into a protective cordon around these Texas Muslims. Organizers say they were hoping for about 500 people to show up and make a human chain. According to the “Dallas Morning News,” more than four times that many people showed up, more than 2,000 people. So, they actually made their chain three and four and five people deep. In addition to the regular crowd there for Texas Muslim Day, more than 2,000 people showed up to protect them and support them. One of the community leaders marveling at the turnout, marveling at the thousands of people who turned out yesterday in Texas to support Texas Muslims at the capital yesterday on their big civics day, one of the speakers, one of the Muslim leaders who was addressing the crowd at this event said, “All thanks and praise to Donald Trump for making this huge turnout possible.” I think he`s probably right. Texas is a long way from Washington, D.C., you know, but national politics are truly national. They get into every nook and cranny and every far-flung place in the country, and because we`re a democracy, every far-flung place in our country, every nook and cranny of our country, also get to say, get to have feedback on what happens in Washington, D.C. So, you are seeing that. You are seeing those voices rise even in places like Texas at the Texas state capital yesterday. You are also seeing in Texas Republican Congressman Lamar Smith. His district office at home in Texas is now frequently decorated with good folks like these picketing, asking for a meeting, demanding that Lamar Smith hold a town hall with his constituents now so they can give them a piece of their mind about saving Obamacare and all the rest. We`ve been very focused on the big protests in places like Washington, D.C. and New York. Today and tonight, there were big pro-immigrant protests in the city of Chicago and again in New York City. But take a look at what is happening in these other largely unexpected places. Look what Republican senators and members of Congress are dealing with at their offices at home. Look, this is Utah. Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, they have office space at home in Utah. This is what`s going on outside their office space at home in Utah. Here`s Missouri. This is what it looks like outside Senator Roy Blunt`s office these days. Even in Arkansas, in the Ozarks in Arkansas, Senator Tom Cotton is not used to having his Arkansas constituents piled up like this outside his home state office. In Colorado, Republican Senator Cory Gardener`s office is becoming a very, very crowded place frequently. When Senator Cory Gardner put out a statement critical of the refugee ban and the travel ban for people from these Muslim countries, it was interesting, some of these protesters who have been hounding his home state offices changed their messages to be messages of thanks for doing the right thing on the Muslim ban. But mostly, they`re pushing him to start saying no to the Trump administration. Vote no on Trump cabinet nominees. They`re pushing them to resist the new administration, whether they`re going to get that, I don`t know, but there`s a lot of pressure on him every day at home. Senator Jeff Flake in Arizona, he`s getting the same kind of pressure in Arizona. Senator Thom Tillis in North Carolina. Look at these pictures. Thom Tillis` home state offices have been mobbed by very big crowds. And I have to tell you, this is not some traveling protest mob that moves around the country targeting all these senators in different states, this is not like the product of a bus tour. These are all individual organic things, these are home state constituents in every circumstance – home state constituents of these members of Congress and senators. And lest you think they`re only targeting Republicans, this was the crowd last night outside Chuck Schumer`s house. Big crowds of Chuck Schumer`s New York constituents marched to Chuck Schumer`s apartment building from his home state Senate office last night. “Man up, Chuck, do not waiver, do not assist.” “Hey, Chuck, put up your dukes.” Here`s what I can only assume is a New York teacher. Do we have that picture of the report card? Yes, check her out. Can we drop the bottom, the little line there on the bottom there? It`s a report card giving him credit for his votes, the X`s, giving him credit for his votes against Betsy DeVos and Jeff Sessions, but dinging him for his incorrect answers on Mike Pompeo, General Mattis and General Kelly, all of whom he voted for then bottom line “C-minus”, “Your work needs improvement.” There are two big things happening in American politics right now. One of them is that Donald Trump won the presidency but the other is all this stuff. All this stuff we are seeing. And these two things are very, very, very closely linked, and they are having a relationship now, they are having an impact on one another that I think is becoming way more important than we have previously appreciated about protest movements in this country. We just got in some stark new information that if you think the Tea Party had a big influence on American politics, what is happening right now in American politics in response to Trump winning the presidency, what`s happening now is already bigger and more popular and is moving American politics faster than the Tea Party ever did. And we`ve got the new data that shows that, next.",1,6219.0,1088.0,host,4.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-01
4,MADDOW," Look at this shot from Mt. Dessert Island in Maine. This is apparently an organizing meeting for a new Indivisible group. One of these groups that`s using the Indivisible guide to become a new activist group, and they`re forming in that little corner of Maine, Mt. Dessert. Do you see the hats they`re wearing? Those are Statue of Liberty crowns. I remember back in 2010 at the start of the Tea Party movement that sprung up on the right to oppose President Obama, to put some steel in the spine of Republicans that they should reject everything about the Obama administration, reject every element of the Obama agenda, one of the startling things I remember about covering that Tea Party movement in 2010 was when we discovered that one of the high profile organizers of that effort was the wife of a sitting Supreme Court justice. Clarence Thomas` wife Ginni Thomas was a Tea Party activist and in a very involved way she founded something – sorry, called Liberty Central. See the hat? And one of the things that Liberty Central was, was like a merchandiser for the Tea Party. They sold Tea Party stuff. They tried to get all the Tea Party people to wear the Statue of Liberty foam crowns.",1,1192.0,213.0,host,5.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-01
5,"GINNI THOMAS, LIBERTY CENTRAL"," Hello, patriots! It is a pleasure to be with you. If you have a crown on I feel like it`s next to your heart and soul.",1,119.0,27.0,guest,6.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-01
6,MADDOW," Around the time that Clarence Thomas` wife Ginni was raising money from undisclosed donors for the Tea Party movement by selling those foam crowns among other things, around that time, the “Washington Post” did a national poll asking Americans whether or not they had ever heard about this Tea Party movement that was taking shape on the American right. By October, 2010, Americans said they had heard a lot about it, 54 percent of Americans said they heard a lot about the Tea Party. For comparison`s sake, that compares roughly with the percentage of Americans right now who say they have heard about those women`s marches that took place in protest of the new President Donald Trump. Roughly equivalent, 54 percent, 57 percent of Americans have heard a lot about that. But check this out. In 2010, at the height of the Tea Party`s power, the proportion of Americans who said they supported or leaned towards supporting the Tea Party was 39 percent. Right now, the number of Americans who say they support or lean towards supporting the women`s marches is 60 percent. And again, that poll was taken in 2010 before the Tea Party was credited with sweeping the nation in the midterm elections of November, 2010, which brought Republicans to power in an unprecedented way. So, I mean, if you compare the people in the Tea Party – the tea partiers and the Statue of Liberty crowns in 2010 with the anti-Trump protesters now in the Statue of Liberty crowns, Americans broadly speaking are equally aware of those two movements but Americans like the one on the right a lot more, not the one on the ideological right, the one on the right side of your screen. A big solid majority of America approves of the women`s marches that happened in protest of Donald Trump. And they are supported by American Americans at a rate that outstrips support of the Tea Party at its apex by more than 20 points, dissent and protest. This movement against Donald Trump, it is the other big thing that is happening in our country, in our politics besides the presidency of Donald Trump. And this movement is not happening just in Washington, D.C. It really is all over the country, every pocket of the country. And it may or may not be the thing putting the steel in the spine of the Democrats in terms of how hard a line they`re going to take against the new administration, but inarguably, Democrats are finding their voice. Democrats are figuring out their tactical approach to opposing the administration and it`s evolving. I mean, on most votes, at least until Democrats can start peeling off Republicans, Democrats aren`t going to have the raw voting power just to flex their muscles and get their way. That means the only way they can really make an impact in Washington is if they leverage what power they do have. If they make a bigger deal than their numbers would suggest because they make a stink. And so, they`ve started making a stink. They figured it out. I mean, Republicans today were very upset that this is what the room looked like when they were trying to call a vote on the Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin who left $100 million in assets off his financial disclosure form and who apparently lied to Congress about whether or not his bank ever robosigned in the mortgage crisis. The reason that room looks so empty is because no Democrats showed up in the room for that committee vote on Steve Mnuchin because they boycotted it. Same goes for Tom Price, the nominee – look at this. Tom Price, nominee to be health secretary, he`s been trading stock in health companies while writing legislation that boosts those companies` stock prices. Democrats all boycotted the hearing for Tom Price. They also all boycotted the hearing for the EPA nominee. The EPA nominee who brought 14 different lawsuits against the EPA and says he doesn`t plan on recusing himself from his own lawsuits once he becomes head of the EPA, so then he will effectively be suing himself. I wonder who`ll win. By boycotting those votes, by refusing to show up for those hearings, the Democrats didn`t stop those nominations. They did drive the Republicans nuts and they did slow them down and they did get a lot of attention to their cause and they made their cause clear. They made it very clear the Democrats are not going along with those nominations and they`ll do anything they can to stop them. By slowing down the process and pushing hard on some of these nominees, they may very well have stopped one nominee who hasn`t gotten a lot of attention but that there`s a reason for that. It`s the nominee for labor secretary, the Carl`s Jr. guy. There hasn`t been talk about withdrawing Andy Puzder`s nomination as labor secretary, but you know what? They`ve pushed his hearing date back four separate times now. The last time they pushed it back, they didn`t bother to set out a new date. And MSNBC can report tonight that Andy Puzder has not turned in any of his paperwork, any of his documentation. He hasn`t turned in any of the paper that is the bare minimum stuff you need to start your confirmation process. They apparently don`t even have an FBI background check on him yet. Are you sure you`re going to keep that guy? Are you sure you want to go through this process? Democrats have focused withering attention on the education secretary nominee, Betsy DeVos. You saw the signs at the protests we`ve been covering, the signs focusing in on Betsy DeVos and what a bad pick she would be for education. The focus on her, the pushback on her, the aggressive questioning of her at her confirmation hearing revealed a nominee who very clearly was not ready for prime time.",1,5647.0,995.0,host,7.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-01

16,MADDOW," Betsy DeVos faces aggressive unanimous opposition from every Democrat in the United States Senate for obvious reasons. But that pushback on her and that public opposition to her nomination, even though Democrats are in the minority, she`s now within one vote of being rejected by the Senate. Democrats also interestingly succeeded in pushing back, slowing down the Jeff Sessions confirmation. He is still not confirmed and now it may be the Republicans who have to slow down his confirmation further so Jeff Sessions can stay a senator long enough to cast a vote for Betsy DeVos because he might be the only way they can stop her from being rejected by the Senate. That`s how far Betsy DeVos is up against the ropes. The Exxon CEO was confirmed by the Senate today, barely, by a 56-43 vote. What he will find waiting for him when he gets to the State Department is the largest dissent channel memorandum ever submitted in the history of the State Department. Over 1,000 State Department employees have reportedly signed their actual names to a formal dissent against the president`s Muslim ban and refugee ban. The White House has made clear its preference that any dissenters on that subject should get out of the State Department, that means the Exxon CEO will now have to decide immediately whether he`s going to try to purge more than a thousand people out of the foreign service and the diplomatic corps which is what the White House apparently wants. Dissent and protest, they are the other big thing that is happening in our country`s politics. I mean, other than Donald Trump winning the presidency, the other big thing we`ve got is dissent and protest. At such a scale and such a pitch that it`s already changed the history of presidential inaugurations. It has, I think, inarguably changed the behavior and attitude of the Democratic Party. And, heck, look what it did to Texas Muslim Capital Day this year in Austin, Texas. But now, there`s question, right, this sea change in this part of our politics. This roar of dissent. This new movement that already outstrips the Tea Party by more than 20 points in terms of its national support. These guys standing outside Jeff Merkley`s office in Oregon with the “Atta Boycott” sign, right? This pressure, this new thing in America comes at the same time we just got a new Supreme Court nominee. And we talked about last night that over recent years, that it has become harder and harder to confirm new justices on the court over time. It is hard to get somebody on the court, no matter who it is. That`s just the trend that we are on. But at this particular, at this particular moment, Democrats are finding their voices. They are finding their footing in taking increasingly hard line unsentimental opposition to the unpopular new president and his administration. And there`s a very popular movement in the streets that is very large and that is very well-supported by the American public. And in this moment, Democrats have this exquisite decision to make about how hard they`re going to fight for seat on the United States Supreme Court. They have the opportunity to fight very, very hard for it, to insist the seat was stolen from President Obama, that it could not be filled by this Republican president unless it`s Merrick Garland who he`s going to nominate and some other nominee who Democrats can vote for without apology and with enthusiasm. They do have an option here to block a vote. It`s never been done before, but they have the numbers to hold this seat open, to take an incredibly hard line position which until recently would have been seen as a very un-Democratic Party-like thing to do. It`s a genuine open question, though, now, as to whether America`s Democrats are newly inspired and newly bolstered enough to be that bold. And that`s next.

Police we`re told have just given protesters an order to disperse. But this has been going on for some time into the evening hours tonight in Berkeley, California.

18,MADDOW," Yesterday in Japan, in Tokyo Bay, an American-guided missile cruiser, the USS Antietam. This big ship, it ran aground. It was anchored at the time, we don`t know how it ran aground but it did. Nobody was hurt, thankfully, but the Antietam is damaged, had to be tugged to a nearby naval base. And before it left the area, it reportedly dumped over a thousand gallons of hydraulic oil of some kind into the sensitive the waters of Tokyo Bay. So, Japan is probably not pleased about that. Today in Smyrna, Delaware, a major prison riot broke out. We don`t have major prison riots all that often in our country but this one in Delaware is a big deal and it`s been going on for a long time. It started at 10:30 Eastern Time this morning. They took four prison employees hostage. They released one hostage this afternoon we`re told they released one more minutes ago. But another two employees, one guard and one counselor are reportedly still being held hostage at this hour in this riot that started this morning, being held hostage by the prisoners. If you`re in a position of national responsibility, you never know when and from where the next crisis is going to arrive. It could be anything, right? A navy ship going aground, prison riot the Delaware. Today, “The Associated Press” and “Washington Post” report the new president had two disastrous phone calls with the leaders of two of our closest allies on Earth. There`s another crisis. “A.P.” reports the new president threatened to send U.S. troops over the border, literally. He reported – the “A.P.” has reported that President Trump threatened to invade Mexico in a conversation with the Mexican president, OK. Simultaneously, the “Washington Post” is reporting the president hung up on the prime minister on the prime minister of Australia after getting into a disagreement with him about refugee policy and spending time bragging about the size of his election victory, President Trump reportedly then hung up. So national leaders have to be ready for any crisis at any time, even the ones they inadvertently create themselves with the people who are supposed to be our best allies in the world. Bleep happens, right? Everyday. You better be ready. Who knows what I`m going to do next or what might happen in the world? But then, there are crises that don`t pop everyday, that don`t surprise us in the headlines, don`t shock everyone anew. There are crises that just quietly percolate for a long time on the back burner and become part of the scenery even though they really are crises. Our next guest says that that kind of crisis is what started last year in Washington when Republicans decided they wouldn`t consider any nominee of President Obama`s to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. He says, quote, “It`s important to remember just how radical and unprecedented the Senate`s approach to the previous Supreme Court nominee was. The refusal to consider any nominee was a raw power grab, a fundamental changing of the rules. The change is terribly damaging for the country`s political system.” And what should Democrats do about it? David Leonhardt at the “New York Times” is not prone to this type of argument but he`s making it now. He says, quote, “Democrats should not weigh this nomination the same way they`ve weighed previous ones. This one is different. The presumption should be that Neil Gorsuch does not deserve confirmation because the process that led to his nomination was illegitimate.” Quote, “I realize this sounds aggressive and partisan and it makes me deeply uncomfortable to make such an argument, but Democrats simply cannot play by the old set of rules now that Republicans are playing by a new one. The only thing worse than the system the Republicans have created is a system in which one political party volunteers to be bullied.” Joining us now is David Leonhardt. He`s a writer and editor for “The New York Times”. He wrote that op-ed today. Mr. Leonhardt, thank you very much for being here.

20,MADDOW," You stated explicitly and it`s palpable you aren`t comfortable making this argument, that this is a form of sort of hard ball. This is almost a form of radical tactical advice you`re giving to the Democrats that you`re not inclined toward. Why did you make this argument?",1,272.0,48.0,host,21.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-01
21,LEONHARDT," Thank you for highlighting that part of it because I`m really not, because – first of all, this is a real shame, right? You have a president who should be allowed to fill a Supreme Court seat with a nominee that he wants. But we had a radical change in the rules, which is Barack Obama was not allowed to fill a Supreme Court opening, and I think it would be a grave mistake, a form of wishful thinking if people said, well, if only the Democrats start playing nice now, maybe the Republicans will go back to playing nice in the future. I don`t really see evidence that`s the case. And so, I think it`s really important the Democrats say, look, there has been a fundamental breaking here of our political norms and values and we can`t simply then move forward as if that didn`t happen.",1,786.0,148.0,guest,22.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-01
22,MADDOW," If they take the radical option that is available to them in this system which is to filibuster, to say we`ve got 41 Democrats here who are going to change the threshold for what it would take to confirm this nominee. It will take 60 votes, you don`t have 60 Democrats in the Senate, you cannot confirm him on a party line vote and we are going to filibuster this nomination. It`s not that Supreme Court nominees have never been filibustered in the past, it wouldn`t be totally unprecedented. But everybody believes and the president advises if that happens, the Republicans should then retaliate, should abolish the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, and basically further break the system, make the system more radically different in the future than it is now. Do you think that would be a lamentable turn of events?",1,823.0,143.0,host,23.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-01
23,LEONHARDT," I do think it would be a lamentable turn of events but I`m not sure of the alternative is. If you look at the signals Republicans have sent, there`s every reason to believe that at some point in the future, when there`s a Democratic president and Democratic majority in the Senate that does not rise to 60 votes, so the flip of what we have now, the Republicans would force the Democrats to go that route because what they did last year was much more radical than that and that wasn`t just one event, right? Mitch McConnell has shown again and again and again that he believes in this kind of opposition and that he brought the Republican Party along. So, given than, it seems to Democrats` presumption should be to say to the Republicans, look, you broke these rules, now live up to what you`ve actually broken and change the rules on the filibuster. Jonathan Chait, who`s really one of the best political journalists out there today, has a smart piece about this in “New York” magazine where he says the idea that the Democrats could save this forcing of the filibuster until next time is naive. There`s no reason it will be more powerful if they don`t use it now and they do use it later than if they use it both times. That feels right to me, but I`m not saying they need to do that. I`m saying their presumption should be against wishful thinking, against naivete and toward understanding the Republicans have fundamentally changed the rules of the Supreme Court in the last year.",1,1486.0,269.0,guest,24.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-01

28,MADDOW," All right. It is interesting. The question now is whether or not, given that argument, there`s a reason the Democrats are talking about Neil Gorsuch right now. The Democratic argument is that it doesn`t matter who the nominee is, the problem is that Republicans broke that system last year by not letting Democratic President Barack Obama make this appointment. So, it doesn`t matter who`s been nominated, we don`t want to talk about it. That radicalism is what they`re responding to now. That`s sort of the argument. The only question is whether they get to 41 Democrats who are willing to go there. I might have information about that next.

29,MADDOW," If it is true that the new president is trying for a shock-and-awe approach to his first days in office, it`s also true that things are moving fast for Democrats. Case in point – after the nomination last night of Neil Gorsuch for the U.S. Supreme Court seat that was vacated by the death of Antonin Scalia last year, we got a statement from Democratic Cory Booker of New Jersey. The statement said, quote, “Having begun the process of reviewing Judge Gorsuch`s extensive judicial record, I have very serious concerns about his nomination.” That is not the same thing as saying no, that`s “very serious concerns.” This, on the other hand, is quite clear. After expressing his various serious concerns last night, this afternoon, Senator Booker posted this, quote, “I will not vote for Judge Gorsuch. I will oppose his nomination.” Just to be perfectly clear. Joining us now for the interview is Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. Senator Booker, thank you so much for being with us tonight. I know there`s a lot going on right now.",1,1032.0,180.0,host,30.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-01
30,MADDOW, I know that you said you will not vote for Judge Gorsuch. Does that also mean that you will support an effort to filibuster his nomination to make it a 60-vote threshold to confirm him?,1,186.0,36.0,host,31.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-01
31,BOOKER," Well, first, I want to give a lot of my fellow Democrats a chance to begin to go through a lot of his opinions like I`ve been doing and to listen to his hearings. But I just want you to know that a 60-vote threshold is not something new for judges to have to go through. The Senate has for a long time provided a moderating force to the passions of this country, pulling people to the middle. And that idea of a 60-vote threshold has helped presidents not put out judges that were out of the mainstream, but actually put people that were. Barack Obama with Merrick Garland could have put a very liberal judge up, but he didn`t. He put somebody up that could appeal to moderate Republicans that could have met that 60-vote threshold should he been allowed to get a hearing and an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. So, there`s something good about for a Supreme Court justice to have that 60-vote threshold, to put people up that are not far right or far left, but that can actually moderate the passions perhaps of the country and get somebody that is within the mainstream.",1,1077.0,200.0,guest,32.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-01
32,MADDOW, Can you imagine President Trump nominating somebody for the Supreme Court who you would vote for?,1,98.0,17.0,host,33.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-01
33,BOOKER," Well, first of all, let`s understand what Donald Trump is doing. He`s picking somebody way out of the mainstream and then he`s bullying the Republicans in the Senate, literally calling them to do the nuclear option, do the nuclear option. That to me is one branch of government shoving around the other branch of government and whipping up – trying to whip up pressure on my fellow Republicans. So, again, I don`t – I liked for him to put up judges that make Democrats stop and say, wait a minute, let`s research this person, let`s look let`s look deeper. But Neil Gorsuch is somebody that, frankly, if you start to look at his opinions, you can see where he is going to go on very big issues in our country that we`re fighting over – the rights of corporations version the rights of individuals. From the hobby lobby decision with his attack on individuals right with the New Mexico disability case, here is somebody that when it comes to things like Citizens United, when it comes to protecting individual reproductive rights, this is somebody that seems to be choosing the big and the powerful over individual rights, which as an originalist that he claims to be is very problematic for me, because so much of our Constitution and our Bill of Rights about individual rights. And somebody now whose decisions seem to be pushing back on disability rights, pushing back on women`s right, pushing back even on worker rights, their free speech rights, as we saw – see in one of his cases where just people speaking out against dangerous working conditions, choosing to be on the side of the corporation. So, I`m sorry. This is a far right wing judge out of the mainstream. Donald Trump doesn`t seem to be trying moderate an appeal to 60 senators. He seems – knows what he did with the far right wing, and now is trying to bully Republicans to change the rules of the Senate, which nobody in the executive branch frankly should be doing right now, especially when the Senate was designed if you look at our history to be a moderating force against the passions of – at large.",1,2073.0,371.0,guest,34.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-01
34,MADDOW," Senator, you are in your first national political job. You came up in politics from the ground up. Served as mayor of Newark. I know that you agonized for a long time as to whether or not national politics was the right place to make the most impact and do the best work for our country. I wonder especially coming up the way you did, what you`re hearing from your constituents? What you`re hearing from people in New Jersey about how to vote on Donald Trump`s nominees for the cabinet, on how hard a line to take on this Supreme Court seat, about how to react after having held open the seat rather than giving Merrick Garland a hearing? What`s your constituent feedback like right now?",1,688.0,127.0,host,35.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-01
35,BOOKER," Well, it`s stunning to me that I think my constituents can`t believe that it`s only been about 12 days of the Trump administration because there is just such a drumbeat of things to be outraged about. In fact, I often worry over these last two weeks about outrage fatigue, because there seems to be multiple things every single day that deserve attention. And some things which really affect working class people seem to barely get noticed, like him hitting mortgage owners, working class people with one of his executive orders. It`s going to make it for the average person in America much more difficult. That barely hit the radar screen, which is something that really is worthy of being outraged about. And so, what I`m seeing right now, some things are pleasing to me that folks who are not political, who have not been engaged are suddenly outraged at many of the things that have happened in these first 12 days, and now engaged in ways they haven`t before and reaching out to my office. I think we`ve seen the Senate switchboards get more volumes of calls now than they have for years before. One senator was quoting that statistic to me. So I`m happy about the engagement. I`m happy about the involvement. But I worry that the way Trump is doing this, there could be some strategy about trying to just continue a blitzkrieg-like effort to put so many objectionable things that we forget that just a few days ago, the news cycle is now full of the Supreme Court justice, out of mainstream, trying to bully the United States into changing his rules. But there are so many things in the last three days that are offensive to the conscience of nonpolitical people, nonpartisan people. And that`s really where my concern lies right now. We cannot get fatigued because what`s happening right now to me is worthy of outrage. And that more and more people should be pushing back. And what`s exciting to me, and you`re seeing this with the DeVos decision, is you`re starting to see Republicans respond to the kind of outrage, even with the repeal of the ACA, which is one of the greatest threats not only to my communities, but you want to talk about rural hospitals? Probably one of the greatest threats to rural hospitals right now, the livelihood of some communities is this attempt by Republicans to rip down the ACA without a plan. But people are hearing that. And you`re starting to see people speak out. So, a lot of this to me is not a partisan reaction I`m getting from my home state. It is sincere concerns, legitimate fears about the impact that these decisions are going to be having on everybody`s life, their ability to earn a livelihood, their ability to have security in this country. And this is not even to talk about the kind of things that are happening on the foreign policy front, which are so outrageous, they`re surreal. People have stopped talking about perhaps of my lifetime the two greatest attacks we`ve seen. Number one has been 9/11 – sobering and tragic and outrageous. But the second probably greatest attack on the sanctity of America has been what the Russians did in their involvement in our election. And even just the non-classified stuff. I`ve sat in classified briefings that are stunning, the stuff of novels. I never thought I would be sitting in briefings where intelligence folks would be giving me facts like this. But the stuff that is actually out this in the public space should have Republicans and Democrats all outraged. I`m grateful for people like Lindsey Graham and John McCain who are talking about this. But again, in the fire hose of things to be outraged about, we`re losing the foreign policy picture. Putting Steve Bannon, a guy who is – I mean, alt-right is a synonym for right supremacy –someone who has been creating a platform for the launching of bigotry and hatred in our country who is now on the National Security Council? Something that flies in the face of not only tradition, but of, you know, Title 50 of the U.S. Code, specifically Section 3021 which specifically says who should be a member of that. Something done by Congress. So, here again, the president in my opinion is endangering national security, politicizing national security, and putting us in a position where perhaps decisions about life and death are being made by political people with an agenda who reflect the growing hate movements we`re seeing in our country. So, I really beg America not to get distracted bipartisanship, not to get overwhelmed by the flow of this, but in a sensible way, look at what`s happening within our country in the first 12 days of Trump administration. Do not get fatigued or distracted by the stream of all this. In my opinion, we`ve got to lean in as a country right now and really focus on resisting and objecting to the way Donald Trump is trying to transform our nation.",1,4847.0,851.0,guest,36.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-02-01

40,MADDOW," What does on notice mean? Asked to explain what the national security adviser meant by that today, the White House spokesman said this, quote, “They wanted to make it understood that we are not going to sit by and not act on their actions.” So, the White House clarifying we`re not going to not act in response to Iran. You`re on notice. What does this mean? Tonight, a spokesperson for CentCom in the Middle East told “The Guardian” newspaper, quote, “We saw the statement as well. We`re waiting for something to come down the lane. We`ve not been asked to change anything operationally in the region.” So, that`s one of the things that happened today. The national security of the president just threatened Iran with something. The White House has no clarification. And the actual U.S. military in the Middle East has to hear about that bizarre and nonspecific empty threat on C-Span because nobody gave them a heads-up about it. Incompetence in the White House press room is sometimes funny. Sometimes it`s not. But that does it for us tonight. We`ll see you again tomorrow.

2,MADDOW," And thanks to you at home for staying with us for the next hour. OK. This is one of those A-blocks that isn`t going to sound like anything else in the news and it will sound like it comes out of nowhere. But every once in a while, we do something like that in this show because I think there`s something going on in the news that even though people aren`t following it, I think might end up being really important. So bear with me here. This is something that`s going to seem like it is out of the blue. But you will soon see why this could be one of the most important things in the world. All right. When he won they called it the world`s biggest consolation prize. It was 1990, the Berlin wall had fallen the year before, the whole Soviet Union would disintegrate by the following year, 1991. But in 1990, Mikhail Gorbachev in the words of “The Guardian” newspaper at the time, he, quote, “took the Nobel Peace Award for losing the Cold War.” Consolation prize. Mikhail Gorbachev, of course, was the last Soviet leader. He did win the Nobel peace prize in 1990 as his country collapsed. And when you win a Nobel Peace Prize, you get a medal, you go to a big ceremony in Norway, you give a big speech, but you also get a big pile of money. And it`s interesting. That Nobel Peace Prize that Mikhail Gorbachev won in 1990, it was worth a little more than a half million dollars in today`s money. And one of the things he decided to do with his Nobel Peace Prize money is he bought some office supplies. He bought some very early computers and printers and other office equipment and he bought that stuff because he decided he would use his Nobel Peace Prize winnings to set up a new newspaper in Russia. And that literally was its name. “New Newspaper” in Russian, and that`s “Novaya Gazeta”. New newspaper, “Novaya Gazeta”. And that paper, “Novaya Gazeta”, got off the ground in 1993, independent paper with an investigative bent. It came into its own over the course of the `90s as the old Soviet Union became the new kleptocratic, oligarch-run Russia, and as an intense little man named Vladimir Putin rose from the KGB to be the head of the successor agency to the KGB, the head of the FSB, and he rose from there to be prime minister and then president and then prime minister again and then president again. And unlike us, Russia has no long-term political consensus about the idea that there ought to be a free press, that there ought to be an aggressive and independent press holding its politicians accountable for their actions. But for 24 years, “Novaya Gazeta” has done its best and they have done great independent, hard hitting investigative work and they have paid a brutal price for in the Putin`s Russia. “Putin`s Russia” was actually a book written by the paper`s star reporter Anna Politkovskaya. Anna Politkovskaya published “Putin`s Russia” in 2004 before she was murdered in 2006, in the elevator bank of her apartment building in Moscow. “Novaya Gazeta` has had a lot of reporters assassinated in Russia over the years. And “Novaya Gazeta” has struggled. Mikhail Gorbachev actually came back a few years ago and made another new investment in the paper to keep it going. They have repeatedly been cyber-attacked within an inch of their life as a publication. They have taken their knocks. They have lost their reporters and staffers. But they are still there. They are still ticking. They persevere. And today, they have just reported something very dramatic that happened in Russia that may turn out in the end to actually be about us. “Novaya Gazeta” reports today that in early December, there was a high level FSB meeting under way. Again, FSB is what the KGB became. It`s a high level FSB meeting underway. It was a regular meeting that included the deputy chief of the cyber unit of the FSB. That unit is called the Information Security Department of the FSB. And the deputy chief of that unit was at that meeting sitting at the table when officers burst into the room, grabbed him, they grabbed the deputy chief of the cyber unit at the FSB. They grabbed him at this meeting in front of all the other people at the meeting, they put a bag over his head and they bodily dragged him out of the room. And that`s the last time anybody`s ever seen him. “Novaya Gazeta” reports that this happened in the first week of December. It`s now being – it`s just being reported now. Now, other Russians publications corroborate that timing today, noting that all evidence of this FSB official, his name is Sergei Mikhailov, they say all evidence of him on social media, anything he might have posted online, all came to a halt. He disappeared online as of December 5th. Disappearing online is one of the things that would happen to you if you, say, had been disappeared into a Russian prison. There are also now multiple sources reporting that this former high-ranking FSB officer, he has not just been arrested. He has been charged with treason. Article 275 of the Russian criminal code, you can be charged with treason if you`ve provided financial, technical or advisory or other assistance to a foreign state or intelligence organization considered hostile to the Russian government. They`re charging him with treason. “The New York Times” says this is the highest profile detention for treason within the FSB since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. And so, we are piecing this together from Russian news sources, from the corroborating information that we can get, from what is starting to be some Western reporting on this arrest. But this is a dramatic thing, right? I mean, imagine if the head of a cyber unit in the CIA or the FBI sitting there in a meeting at the CIA or the FBI and officers come in, throw a bag over his head, drag him away and nobody hears about it for more than a month and nobody sees him since. But this dramatic thing that happened in Russia, it`s dramatic for Russia, it may also be important for what`s going on in our country right now. And I am fully aware there`s a lot going on in our country right now. There`s a lot to see, there`s a lot to follow, there`s a lot to absorb. I mean, we just got this vague non-specific order of some kind from our new president saying he`s going to build a wall between us and Mexico. Today that resulted in the Mexican president cancelling his planned visit to Washington then our new president tried to say the Mexican president didn`t cancel on him, it was a mutual agreement. Then, the White House announced the way they were going to pay for this wall was a big tax on all Mexican imports into this country. They announced that, then within a couple hours, they dropped that, and they walked that back and said, no, no, of course, we`re not going to do that, even though we just announced we`re doing to do that. We were told all day that we should expect an order from the president, maybe today, maybe tomorrow, initiating some sort of federal review into his bananas absolutely unsupported contention that there were millions of illegal votes cast for his opponent in this past election. Also today his chief strategist, who was the head of a right wing pro-Trump website before Trump hired him to run his campaign, he initiated an interview with the “New York Times” today. “The New York Times” didn`t call him, he called them in order to announce to the world through “The New York Times” that, in his view, the media is the opposition party in America and the American media should henceforth keep its mouth shut. So, when there`s a grand new presidential administration in Washington and when it`s one that is behaving this erratically and radically and saying stuff this crazy and this unprecedented, it can be dizzying over the course of a day. It`s easy to go through any daily news cycle, just minute to minute pinging back and forth between all the crazy stuff they`re saying. You know, this fights they`re starting, the lies they`re telling, the stuff they say they`re going to do even if maybe they`re not going to do it, you can overwhelmed, you can get very caught up in the churn on days like this. But that noise level is going to be there every day, right? That`s what the campaign was like, too. That`s why, you know, Trump and his campaign got all the free news coverage in the world because they know how to make newsworthy noise. They know how to safe stuff that gets attention and generates outrage and backlash. They know how to make every new pronouncement the start of a new news flurry as people react and get bewildered and overwhelmed and angered by what they do. But if we have learned anything thus far in covering the Trump brand of politics, it`s to not focus so intently on what they`re saying that we miss what is being done. To not focus so intently on every new pronouncement that we lose focus on what is actually going on that we can observe in the world. And if these reports from “Novaya Gazeta” and others Russian sources are accurate, that a senior FSB official in the cyber unit got dragged out of an FSB meeting with a bag thrown over his head and he`s arrested for treason and is now in prison awaiting what is expected to be a secret military tribunal on those treason charges – well, we need to notice that is happening and, we need to ask whether that has something to do with us. In part, we may need to ask whether the treason he committed, whether the foreign government that he`s charged with aiding and abetting is our foreign government. Because over the closing months of our presidential election and right up through the blame duck period before the new president was sworn in, we – the American people, we had dropped on us a series of news bombs about Russia influencing our election, right? There was the unconfirmed dossier of dirt on Donald Trump that the Russian government had allegedly collected and was allegedly using against him to get him to do their bidding. That unconfirmed super inflammatory dossier of information was reportedly collected by a well-respected former MI6 British intelligence operative. It was published online last month whereupon that former British intelligence operative promptly disappeared. He took himself off the grid. His business partner said he did it for his own safety. Before that, there was the joint intelligence report from the NSA, the CIA, the FBI, the Office of Director of National Intelligence. We all saw the unclassified version, high-ranking officials in our own government saw the classified version. But either way, it contained these very detailed allegations about a Russian government campaign designed to influence our election ordered and directed from the highest levels from Putin`s office and carried out through cyber attacks, through strategic leaks of stolen information, through complex, sophisticated propaganda efforts designed to hurt Hillary Clinton`s chances in the election and bolster Donald Trump`s. Before that, it was the statement in October when the Department of Homeland Security and Director of National Intelligence warned ahead of the election there was a concerted Russian government effort to influence our election, including hacking operations to steal and publicize information from the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign in order to hurt them both. Before that, in September, there was the warning published by the FBI saying that boards of elections in individual U.S. states had been hacked. The IP addresses they named and publicized in conjunction with those attacks were later traced back to a server farm in Russia. All of – so, all of these reports, right, intelligence reports, news reports, these will all be part of the history of this presidential campaign and this presidential election. But now in the early days of this presidency, those reports also form the basis of live, current, forward-looking concern about whether not just the election but this presidency might potentially be compromised by foreign influence. And it`s not an abstract concern. It inflicts a lot of the way we are processing the day to day, fast-moving, sometimes overwhelming news that we`re getting out of this new administration, right? I mean, when Republican senators decided none of them would oppose him, that cleared the way for our next secretary of state to be an American businessman who is thought to have a closer personal relationship than any other living American with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The man who is slated to be our next secretary of state is the recipient of the Order of Friendship Award which Vladimir Putin personally pinned to his chest not that long ago. The highest award the Russian government gives to a Russian citizen. He will now be our secretary of state. Hasn`t been confirmed but now that the Republicans who said they were concerned about him and his ties to Russia have decided they don`t care that much, now, his nomination is all but assured. And now that his nomination is all but assured, today, we learned that they, boom, just cleared out the entire upper echelon of experienced management at the U.S. State Department. The State Department that Rex Tillerson is about to take over. People who have been there since the 1970s, people who have been there since the `80s, career senior management, career foreign service officers, career diplomats. One former high-ranking career diplomat who was first appointed by George W. Bush said today, quote, “As a career diplomat, I experienced many presidential transitions and I never saw anything like this dangerous purge of public servants now underway at State.” Now underway at State ahead of Rex Tillerson taking over. Another former assistant secretary of state tweeted today specifically about the suddenness, the sudden rush to get all the top-level people out of the State Department. Quote, “Tom Countryman, foreign service officer, acting T at State”, which means he was the person in charges of arms control and international security. According to this one report, he was told to leave the State Department tomorrow. He was given that instruction today. He was on a plane flying to Rome for a nonproliferation meeting. He was ordered to turn around and fly back and be gone from the State Department by tomorrow. He`s a career foreign service officer, right? Somebody operating at such a high level of American diplomacy he`s identified by one letter. Right now, Tom Countryman is still listed on the State Department web site. Read it yourself. It lists his service at U.S. embassy going back to 1982, serving everywhere from Serbia to Egypt to Greece to Italy. It says at the bottom his foreign languages are Serbo-Croatian, Arabic, Italian, Greek and German. Yes, we better get that guy out of there quick. Couldn`t possibly imagine we`d need him or anything. And we don`t – it`s not like they got somebody to replace him, or any of these people who left tonight. But that guy, among others, right, out. That particularly guy, they took him off a plane, told him to turn around and get out according to this one report. Why the rush? Well, we`re also getting first reports tonight, including from a reporter at Politico.com who cites several sources in saying that the Trump administration has drafted and started circulating text of an executive order that would unilaterally lift U.S. sanctions on Russia. This is – NBC News has not confirmed these reports but this is out there. These rumblings are out there. And you put these things together and these are forward-looking concerns, right? I mean, if we`re going to get this close ally, this unusually close ally of Vladimir Putin to be our secretary of state and we`ll get the top tier of the State Department otherwise cleared away and quick with these rumblings that there may be a fast and unilateral move to drop the U.S. sanctions on Russia, how do they explain this stuff? Why is all this happening? I mean, what has Russia done to deserve getting out of the sanctions that our country put on them? I mean, the sanctions are there for a reason. The sanctions got put on Russia because they unilaterally annexed part of another country and took their land. Has Russia done something to all of a sudden not deserve sanctions for that? What has changed? What is the explanation for this radical shift toward giving Vladimir Putin what he wants in exchange for him giving us nothing? Especially when actions like that are likely to come at some political cost here in the United States for the new administration. We broke news last night of the new national polling data that shows when you ask the American people their opinion of Russia right now, it`s very negative. You ask the American people their opinion of Russia, their opinion of Vladimir Putin, it`s very, very negative. That is also true even if you just ask Donald Trump supporters. Even Donald Trump voters are not hot on Russia. They`re really not hot on Vladimir Putin. And so, the new president and the Trump administration will likely pay a political cost if they actually do follow through with the stuff they appear to be doing for Russia and for Putin. So, why are they doing it? What explains it? These are not backward-looking concerns, these are current concerns about whether or not the American presidency has to a certain degree been somehow captured by foreign influence. How do we figure out if that`s true? We maybe have the start of an answer and that is next.",1,17466.0,3037.0,host,3.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-26
3,MADDOW," So, we`re reporting tonight on concerns about potential Russian influence over the U.S. presidency and some provocative new reports from Russia that may bolster some of those concerns here in this country. And again, these are not concerns just about how the election went in November, these are current concerns and prospective concerns about our new president and his presidency going forward. These are potent enough concerns that there`s now at least one new political ad about it.",1,486.0,79.0,host,4.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-26
4,AD NARRATOR," The president has a secret. What is it? It`s the reason Donald Trump always puts Vladimir Putin first, why Trump insults and abandons our allies but basks in Putin`s praise. Why he compares American intelligence officers who protect us to Nazis and covers for Putin`s attacks on our democracy. He hides connections to Russians and troubling stories keep coming. Is Donald Trump compromised? How can we trust him if he won`t come clean?",1,436.0,74.0,guest,5.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-26
5,MADDOW," That ad is running on national cable. It`s being run by a group formed by Evan McMullin. Remember him? Former CIA officer who ran a conservative campaign in a few states against Trump in the presidential election this year. But the questions that are raised in this ad, again, prospective questions, not questions about the election looking back, they are questions about the presidency highlighting the fact that these concerns about potential Russian influence, they`re not going to go away the further we get from the election. Those concerns and questions are going to recur and get more acute and potentially get more troubling if the new administration continues its current tack toward Russia. If they behave toward Russia in the way they have telegraphed. And, you know, there will be an investigation into Russian efforts to influence our election on Trump`s behalf. They will be carried out by the intelligence committees in the House and the Senate. Both of those committees, of course, headed up by Republican chairmen who are not excited about taking on those investigatory responsibilities. The FBI investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, that alleged investigation that the FBI won`t confirm or deny, that will presumably continue under the FBI if it exists already even though Jeff Sessions will now be the Department of Justice and Senator Sessions said he will not necessarily recuse himself from any investigations of the Trump campaign even though he personally was formally part of the Trump campaign. So, there`s – the investigations will continue however much confidence you have in them moving forward under this Congress and administration. But even without those we have these existing declarations from the intelligence community, right, which we got under the previous administration. We`ve got the investigation they gave us already before Trump took over. And as we now see the Trump administration starting to act, including the way they`re starting to act toward Russia, for a while at least, we`re sort of on our own, as citizens in terms of our assessment about whether or not what the intelligence community told us is true, whether or not Russia did interfere to help elect the guy who is now our president. And one of the things we as citizens and certainly we in the press have been watching for in order to assess the veracity of those claims from our own intelligence community, what we have been watching for in part are signs from Russia, signs in Russia that might corroborate anything that we`ve been told by our intelligence agencies here in the United States about what Russia did. I mean, in public obviously all Russian officials, the Russian government up and down completely deny all of it. They always deny everything, right? But according to them publicly, they say they had absolutely nothing do with trying to influence our election, it`s all poppycock. Well, once our intelligence community made detailed allegations about what the Russian government did to influence our election, we have been since watching to see how Russia would react to those detailed allegations, because think about it for a second – I mean, even if, you know, you knowing nothing about how Russia operates in particular, even if you know nothing about spying other than what you read in spy novels, think about it, right? If these allegations about what Russia did, these allegations from our intelligence community, if they`re all false, if it`s all made up and Russia had nothing do with interfering in our election, then we should expect zero response in Russia to those allegations. There`s no reason for them to respond to any of it. It`s all poppycock, it`s all made up, who cares? But if our intelligence community told us true things, if what they told us is not made up. If some of it is what Russia did, if even what that ex-MI6 agent put in that dossier on Trump, if any of that was published was true, you would expect a reaction inside Russia. I mean, think about it. Your – put yourself in their shoes. You`re some Russian, high ranking official, you know, imagine you`re Vladimir Putin. You`re flipping through this dossier, which you know has been circulating widely, ultimately. It gets published in the United States, you`re flipping through it or you`re flipping through these intelligence community documents about Russian interference in the election, you`re flipping through it, and you`re thinking, no, that`s made up, that`s made up, that`s made up. Hey, wait a minute that bit is true. We did do that. If you`re the Russian government, if you`re a Russian official and anything the U.S. intelligence agencies, anything that unconfirmed dossier turns out to be true, you act, right? Because that`s a problem for you and the Russian government. Because how did the West find out? You then have to figure out how the U.S. government, how American intelligence, how Western intelligence sources got hold of some true thing the Russian government secretly did. I mean, if the Russian denials were correct and they had nothing to do with our elections, they`d have no response to any of these allegations in the West, that Russia helped elect Donald Trump. But if any of it was right, they have to find the mole. They have a responsibility in Russia to find out how that true information about their own actions got out. Who leaked it? Who knew what the Russian government was doing and fed that true secret information to the West? What we have been watching for in part is Russian efforts to plug the hole. Find the leaker, find the mole, punish someone who had access to real Russian government information, punish someone for letting that real Russian government information out into the world, to people who should not have in the foreign governments and Western intelligence services. And now, we have news that the deputy head of cyber operations at the FSB has been arrested and they threw a bag over his head at a meeting, dragged him out of the room, charged him with treason and disappeared him into a Russian prison. In addition to that, we are also told there is one additional head that has rolled at the FSB. There are conflicting reports as to whether he has also been arrested or whether he has just fired, but his job in the FSB was that he was deputy director of counterintelligence. What`s counterintelligence? Finding spies. It was his job at the FSB, at the Russian spy agency, to stop spies, to stop Western intelligence agencies from penetrating the FSB and getting Russian government information, to stop anybody in the FSB from delivering sensitive information to any foreign source. Those are the two heads that we now know have just rolled in Russia. One guy charged with treason and one guy who was in charge of making sure that nobody at the FSB ever went rogue and decided to help the west figure out what Russia was doing. Again, this is being described as the highest profile treason arrest in the FSB since the collapse of the Soviet Union. They are never going to tell us what these treason charges are about. I mean, unofficially, Russian media sources report the guy with the bag over his head with the treason charges, he may have tipped off U.S. intelligence agencies to what Russia was doing to influence our election. That`s how it`s being reported in Russian press, in the non-state controlled Russian press. If that`s true, then him getting arrested is sort of all but confirmation that Russia did it, right? You don`t need to plug the leak if somebody is making something up. You do need to plug the leak, you do need to arrest somebody for treason if they`re giving out real information. And for us here in the United States watching the action of our new president and wondering what motivates those actions, this is our first foreign corroboration that he really may have been helped on his way to the presidency by a hostile foreign power, which creates new urgency for us to know whether his actions toward Russia now as our president are a thank you, are reciprocal, or some kind of payment for what they did. Yes, listen to what they say, but watch what is going on as well. We`ll be right back.",1,8236.0,1410.0,host,6.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-26
6,MADDOW," Today in Philly, Republican members of Congress gathered for their annual retreat. The newly Republican president made an appearance. The newly elected prime minister of the U.K. was there, which is weird. Foreign leaders aren`t supposed to make partisan addresses to one political party in our country but, hey, all bets are off now, right? But what the Republicans also got in Philly today was thousands of protesters – look at that – right outside their meeting. Protesters held a dance party outside the Republicans` hotel last night, which is awesome. And then 5,000 freaking protesters marched through the city streets today outside their meeting site. Protest organizers expected about 3,000 people. They reportedly got about 5,000 people, and if you were wondering what the Democrats were up to while Republicans were facing this in Philly today, we ended up finding the Democrats today as well. The Republicans were turning Philly inside out with thousands of protesters. Senate Democrats were, in contrast, laying low in Shepherdstown, West Virginia. And because it`s not work, it`s a work retreat, we get to see them all in jeans and sweatshirts. I see you, Minnesota. Eventually, though, even though the Democrats` gathering was super low key, even the locals figure out all the Senate Democrats were in town and that`s how we got this tape today. Who is way out of touch with the needs of the people of West Virginia and working people all over this country. They have the Senate. They have the House. They have the White House.",1,1542.0,258.0,host,7.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-26

9,MADDOW," Pass the megaphone, everybody. Several hundred people showed up at the site of the Democrats` retreat in West Virginia today to make their views known. Senate Democrats responded by going out and talking to everybody, passing the megaphone, they promised to keep fighting the good fight. But that is literally just shouting on a hillside in West Virginia. And in Washington and in their home districts, Democratic members of the Senate, Democratic members of the House have seen protesters flooding their offices, especially for Senate offices. Protesters have been demanding to know why Trump cabinet picks are sailing through. Again, these protests we`ve been highlighting in legislative offices and Senate offices around the country, they`re not just targeting Republicans. They are targeting Democrats, too. Callers today have reportedly been jamming the phone lines of both Republican and Democratic senators trying to get senators to vote against Betsy DeVos for education secretary. I mean, it`s demonstrations, it`s phone calls, it`s confronting them at their retreat in West Virginia. But check this out, tonight, we have an exclusive early look at an ad by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee against the nominee for the secretary of the treasury, Steve Mnuchin. They`re asking voters to call their senators and ask them to vote no on Steve Mnuchin. This is part of the pressure against the Trump cabinet, too. Have a look.",1,1440.0,229.0,host,10.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-26

We can`t let that happen.",1,384.0,73.0,guest,11.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-26
11,MADDOW," That ad will start running this weekend in Virginia, Delaware, Nevada and then in Washington, D.C. starting Monday, and maybe that will have an effect. But you see Republicans and Democrats getting targeted both on the Senate on these picks because for the most part, Democrats have allowed the Trump cabinet picks to sail through. I mean, they`re not slowing down the process. We saw Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts going after Ben Carson hard during his confirmation hearing, but then she turned around and she voted for Ben Carson in committee. You saw Dianne Feinstein stapling Mike Pompeo, but then she voted for him to make him director of the CIA. Until yesterday, the only Senate Democrat to vote against every one of Donald Trump`s cabinet nominees thus far was New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Will they hold the line when even more controversial picks come up for their votes? Let`s ask one of them. Senator Al Franken of Minnesota joins us next.

15,MADDOW," Senator Al Franken of Minnesota and the rest of his colleagues in the Senate have given the new cabinet nominees a bruising in the confirmation hearings the last couple weeks. Senate Democrats have been fairly relentless in their questioning, but when it`s time to vote, Senate Democrats in most line have fallen in line and voted to confirm the Trump nominees. They`ve made noise in the hearings but in the end, they have said, yes in pretty big numbers, and I don`t necessarily understand why. I`m not saying it`s a bad thing I just don`t understand it. Here to help me understand is Senator Al Franken of Minnesota. Senator, thanks very much for being with us tonight.

20,FRANKEN," Take Defense Secretary Mattis. You`re right Kirsten is the only one that`s voted against every nominee to come before us because she`s the only one who voted against Mattis and I think that – Mattis is against torture. Mattis is a well-respected intellectual. We know that we can`t stop these nominees but, believe me, he`s one of the best picks that we`ve seen among all the nominees.",1,386.0,68.0,guest,21.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-26
21,MADDOW," Obviously, General Mattis` vote was overwhelming as you said. We`ve seen overwhelming votes and you shared in the yes votes for Nikki Haley and for John Kelly at Department of Homeland Security. Should we just – is there an overall Democratic strategy around these things or is every senator just making their own call because there`s no Democratic plan to try to stand together on these?",1,389.0,67.0,host,22.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-26
22,FRANKEN," Well, you`re right. We had a retreat this weekend. We talked about nominations and you talk about DeVos. She`s someone that I – there`s not going to be one Democratic vote for her and we`re trying to find Republicans who will vote against her because she`s an ideologue who knows next to nothing about education policy as we demonstrated – she demonstrated, really, in her confirmation hearing. Price, I – he`s unacceptable. I mean, there`s going to be a lot of these nominees who we`re going to do everything we can to defeat. As you know, these nominees need 51 votes and we have 48, so we need some Republicans to defeat some. But you will see Pruitt, you`ll see a number of these nominees who will virtually all of us will oppose them and I`m sure the same – I`m sure that`s true with DeVos. I`ll bet you it`s true with Price.",1,831.0,154.0,guest,23.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-26
23,MADDOW," Should we expect that because of some strategic whip effort among Democratic senators or do you just think everybody agrees on their own terms that somebody like Betsy DeVos doesn`t deserve a vote? What I`m trying to get at is, is there an overarching Democratic strategy or do we have to predict these votes based on what we know about each one of you as individuals?",1,369.0,67.0,host,24.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-26

27,MADDOW," It makes it sound like there is a strategy. I know, in general, you guys are being tight-lipped about what happened at the retreat that you had this week, this time you spent in West Virginia. Can you tell us anything about what kind of conversations, what topics you guys are talking about and how you felt about those several hundred people showing up to cheer you on but give you criticism, too?",1,399.0,74.0,host,28.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-26
28,FRANKEN," That was actually terrific because they were basically there to cheer us on. And a handful – we didn`t want 48 senators descending on them, so we send – a handful went out. We did talk to some Trump voters who we invited in. Joe Manchin in – of West Virginia was our host and there were a lot of Trump voters in West Virginia. And so, we talked to a number of them. We thought that was good for us to hear. And we talked obviously a lot about the ACA and about – we – our sense is that there are a number of Republicans getting cold feet now because they have no plan to replace this and they`re all over the place. The president has said that everyone will have an insurance. Tom Price is someone who has put forward plans to replace that do not provide any protections for people that Republicans say now they want to – you know, the pre-conditions that don`t discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. No annual caps, yearly caps. Stay on through your 26th birthday, reducing the donut hole and the prescription drugs. All the stuff that is in the ACA. To me, it`s much easier – the ACA isn`t perfect and we saw the premiums in the exchanges spike this year. To me, the much easier thing is to address that, and there`s definitely ways to address that and bring those prices down and bring those costs down and to go after pharmaceuticals. This is something actually that President Trump has talked about, we hope he`s sincere about it. So, to me, I – we`re trying to strategize so that we can keep ACA and fix what`s wrong with it and expand on in the way that Donald Trump seems to be talking about because he wants everyone to be insured.",1,1660.0,313.0,guest,29.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-26

32,MADDOW," It`s easy to ignore one person. It`s actually pretty to ignore 10 people. But when thousands of people are all yelling the same thing at you all at once – which is now starting to be a daily occurrence in this country – you do at least have to consider listening to them, it turns out.

33,MADDOW," December, 2009, a group of business leaders took out a full page ad in the “New York Times”. It was addressed to President Obama and Congress on the subject of climate change. Quote, “If we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet.” Business leaders, signed by dozens of business leaders, including at the bottom, Donald J. Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka. That wasn`t that long ago. 2009. But naturally, things have changed. Our current president now says nobody really knows if climate change exists. And in the first big fight of the transition after he was elected, his team demanded to the Department of Energy they hand over the names of all staffers in that agency who had worked on climate change issues in any capacity. And that demand for names, that led to an immediate public outcry. A lot of news coverage of that. Our shows and a lot of media outlets asked the Energy Department for their response. They sent us this defiant statement that included this line in bold letters. We didn`t bold it. They did. “We will not be providing individual names to the transition team.” That bold push back and the outrage around that request, apparently, it worked. The very next day, the transition backed off. They said their request for those names was not authorized. Public pressure works sometimes. This week, same story. Monday, an internal memo was sent to all scientists at the USDA, the Agriculture Department, banning them from sharing research in any public facing way. Don`t show the people. Don`t talk about what you are doing. But there was a public outcry and 24 hours later, that order to gag all the scientists at the Agriculture Department, that order was rescinded. Public pressure sometimes works. And we may be watching the latest example play out right now. Yesterday, we woke up to this headline in “Reuters”. “Trump administration tells EPA to cut climate change page from its website.” The “Reuters” said that the climate change page including a myriad of data that could be disappeared that very day, except – cue public outrage – and by night fall, this was the headline. Quote, “Trump administration backs off plan to scrub climate pages from EPA website.” I mean, this stuff could still disappear. The administration, you know, says everything is subject to review. And they`re warning today about sweeping cuts to the EPA budget and work force. But for now, we are starting to see public pressure on these guys. Public pressure is on a lot of the stuff they are doing. If you go to the EPA website right now, that climate page and all its data is still up. It is still there. How long that lasts? I don`t know. But pressure is probably what kept it up. I usually say watch this space. But in this case, watch this page. We will too.",1,2879.0,502.0,host,34.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-26

0,"RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC ANCHOR"," And thanks to you at home for staying with us for the next hour. You know, we knew this was going to be a busy news week. We knew that, you know, in a week like this, we should count on an unpredictable rush of news over the course of the week. We were not wrong about that. Today has been a little bit nuts. This afternoon, the president released his last major batch of pardons and commutations including one for the former deputy chairman of the joint chiefs, Marine General Hoss Cartwright. He was facing serious prison time for talking with a reporter about a top secret covert action against Iran. General Cartwright will be pardoned for lying to the FBI about those conversations. Army Private First Class Chelsea Manning who leaked reams of military and diplomatic files to WikiLeaks, she will not be pardoned for her crimes but she will have her sentence commuted after serving roughly seven years in prison. She`ll be getting out of prison in May. We`re going to have Charlie Savage from “The New York Times” here in just a moment to talk about those cases. We can also expect President Obama himself to talk about those cases tomorrow in what will be his last ever presidential press conference. With only two more full days of this presidency before the next one starts, today was the day when one of the women who accused the incoming president of inappropriate sexual behavior, a former contestant on his reality show, she today announced that she is filing a lawsuit against the president-elect, against the man who on Friday will become the next president. Her lawyer says as part of the lawsuit, she may subpoena recordings made on the set of the reality TV show “The Apprentice.” Those tapes, of course, have been a source of rumor and speculation as to what Mr. Trump was caught on tape saying, if anything, while he was filming that show. We may know if the lawsuit releases those tapes as part of its discovery process. Amid confirmation hearings today for the would-be secretaries of education and the interior, there was a little bit of drama today about the nominee to be health secretary. Democrats are pushing to delay the health secretary`s confirmation hearings amid new corruption allegations against Congressman Tom Price and his stock trading while he`s been in Congress. There was also some new drama about the CEO of Exxon, as well, who the incoming administration wants to make secretary of state. A big red light started flashing on the political dashboard tonight that indicates some concerns that they may not be able to get Rex Tillerson confirmed as secretary of state. So, there`s lots going on right now. We`re going to have more on almost all of those stories. Big night, lots of stories still developing into the evening tonight. We sort of expect that every night this week is going to be like that. But for getting at what continues to be the biggest story in the country of all right now, to get at that one tonight, weirdly, it might help to know that there used to be an official travel agency of the Soviet Union, I kid you not. Early, Joseph Stalin created an official travel agency for the USSR. It was called “Intourist”. If you were a foreigner, and you wanted to visit the young Soviet Union, you`d had to go through Intourist and they would manage your trip, and I do mean manage. They managed hotels all over the Soviet Union. All these Intourist hotels. And if you wanted to come visit the Soviet Union as a foreign tourist or as a foreign business traveler, you would have to stay in one of these Intourist hotels. This whole Intourist system was set up by Stalin and everybody who worked at these lovely, very Soviet-looking hotels, they would keep an eye on you while you were having your Russian visit. They would keep a very, very, very close eye on you. Quote, “The bellboys, drivers, cooks and maids all worked for the NKVD, which is the secret police agency later known as the KGB.” Also on the payroll at these hotels were the prostitutes who were deployed to entrap and blackmail visiting foreign politicians and businessmen. And these Intourist hotels, they were all over the Soviet Union and they all operated basically the same way. There would be a normal if somewhat terrifying and brutalist Soviet hotel experience for most visitors. But if some foreigner came through who was potentially influential in his or her home country, some decision maker who might useful to the Soviet state at some point, well, then they would basically deploy their intelligence assets. They would deploy them to the foreigners` hotel room. Part of the reason we know the details of this is because one of these hotels, one of these Intourist hotels in the former Soviet Republic now called Estonia. Estonia is no longer part of the Russian federation. Estonia is its own thing. But they had one of these Intourist hotels and it`s in private hands now. And a few years ago, the new owners of the Intourist hotel in Estonia, they opened up a museum to highlight all the listening devices and hidden cameras and microphones and spying stations that they found inside the hotel after it was no longer a Soviet spying operation. They started running a museum where they would show how the KGB would spy on people staying in special rooms in this hotel where potentially influential or important foreigners would be assigned to stay when they came to visit. The KGB would mount entrapment operations. They basically would set up these foreigners to be blackmailed by the Soviet Union. Out of the 400 hotel rooms in this hotel in Estonia, the KGB had 60 of the rooms wired. They also had a monopoly on prostitution at the hotel. All of the prostitutes that they allowed to work at the hotel, all of them were KGB. And we know this in part, we know this in detail with the visuals and everything because it`s a museum now. So, you can see, you know, the holes in the walls and the ways the KGB spied on foreigners and made their blackmail tapes, it`s kind of amazing, right? It`s all an open secret now. Also, if you`re ever in Estonia, best tourist detour ever. Go see the KGB spying on the hotel room museum. It`s on the 23rd floor. And, of course, now, the KGB doesn`t exist anymore. KGB became the FSB, which is two whole letters different than the KGB. Ultimately, the head of the FSB became this guy and this guy got to be who he is now. This guy got to be president of Russia in a very KGB kind of way. In the immediate post-Soviet era, Boris Yeltsin was president of Russia, right? He was the first president of Russia after the Soviet Union collapsed. And when Boris Yeltsin was president of Russia, first president they`ve ever had, Russia was a mess, a mess in lots and lots of different ways. Politically, they were a mess. They went through five different prime ministers in three years while Yeltsin was president. In the late 1990s, there was a powerful federal prosecutor who was looking into President Yeltsin, looking into other people in Yeltsin`s government, looking into them for, allegedly, skimming off lots and lots of money into private foreign bank accounts. As prosecutors looking into high-level corruption in the new Russian presidency. And then, lo and behold, a grainy tape turns up that shows that federal prosecutor in a hotel bed with two very young-looking prostitutes. And maybe it`s just a grainy tape and who can say if that`s really the prosecutor? But then the head of the FSB, came out and publicly confirmed – yes, I hereby attest that is the prosecutor. That is definitely him, I`m the head the KGB – I mean the FSB and I can hereby assure the public that this terrible person doing terrible things with these prostitutes in this terrible video filmed in this terrible hotel room, I can hereby tell you that is this terrible prosecutor, who incidentally has been looking into corruption by the president. And so, because of that grainy tape, the prosecutor who`s looking into Yeltsin lost his job and President Yeltsin was very thankful and he named yet another new prime minister, he named as his new prime minister, the head of the FSB, Vladimir Putin. And that put a stop to the musical chairs at the top of the Russian government and it never started up again because Vladimir Putin has not given up power since. How Vladimir Putin stopped just being a KGB guy and got political power in the first place was by producing at just the right time and in just the right way, just the right sex tape to use for political purposes. Ahem. Today in Russia, President Putin spoke to reporters about the American intelligence community concluding that Putin himself and his government interfered in our presidential election to help Donald Trump win that election. He also addressed the dossier of alleged dirt on Donald Trump in Russia that was published by BuzzFeed even though U.S. intelligence and BuzzFeed has not verified the claims in it. Obviously, this is a dossier the incoming president strenuously denies. Well, Mr. Putin said today he also denies that any of that material is real. He says it`s all made up. He says it`s absurd to think that Russian intelligence, the Russian government would even try to collect damaging information on someone like Donald Trump while he visited Russia. Quote, “Putin said that Trump wasn`t a politician when he visited Moscow in the past, and Russian officials weren`t aware that he held any political ambitions.” To be clear, Donald Trump spent time in Russia in 2013. That`s after he had talked publicly about running for president in the 1980s and the 1990s after he kind of started to run for president in the year 2000, and after he add said repeatedly he was going to mount a run in 2012, he had very publicly for decades been flirting with running for president before he got to Moscow in 2013. But the Russian explanation today for why they definitely wouldn`t ever bother collecting any sort of intel on Trump while Trump visited Russia, their explanation is that they had no idea that he had any political ambitions, why would they think that? President Putin told reporters at the Kremlin today it is, quote, “complete nonsense” to believe that Russian security services, quote, “chase after every American billionaire” while those billionaires are in Russia doing business. Vladimir Putin also made comments today about how he didn`t think that Donald Trump would ever visit prostitutes, but if he did Russian prostitutes are, quote, “undoubtedly the best in the world.” I raise that not because of its news value but just so we all know what we`re dealing with here. There are two full days left of the Obama administration. One of the things that has happened in the very last days of the Obama administration is that the outgoing president has accelerated the deployment of U.S. troops to – right next to Russia. These are American marines from Camp Lejeune arriving in Central Norway this week. This is the first time that foreign troops have been posted to Norway since the end of World War II. But Norway has 120 mile long border with Russia. Russia has been pushing at its own borders militarily over the last several years, including, of course, invading and taking over part of Ukraine and the countries that border Russia that we are sworn to protect from Russian aggression because we are in a treaty alliance with them in NATO, those countries are getting nervous about Russia. And so, Marines from Camp Lejeune are stationed in Norway now and a U.S. deployment much larger than that just arrived in Poland as well. This happened this past week – the largest troop deployment in Europe since the end of the Cold War. A thousand troops going up to several thousand troops stationed in Poland. The Kremlin is furious about it. But Poland wants American troop there is. They negotiated for it at the last NATO meeting to get American troops into Poland, because, again, they want Americans there. They want some protection. They want American protection if Russia decides to push out of its borders again. This is the Third Armor Brigade combat team from Ft. Carson, Colorado, now based in Poland. This is a deployment that was supposed to start later this month. President Obama moved it up to start earlier, so, they are there now as he is leaving office. And these troops, along Russia`s edge, these troops in Norway as of this week, in Poland as of last week, soon to be in Estonia and Bulgaria and Romania, U.S. troops in all these countries that Russia can see from its house, this is an unheralded story of how President Obama is leaving office. This is part of the way that President Obama is leaving office, by pushing up these deployments and getting those troops there and Russia hates it. But our allies around Russia`s edges, they say they want it and we have said that we will be there for them and President Obama has really hurried this up in these last days to show our allies that we are there for them, and he`s done in the a rush before he leaves office. And there is a lot going on in politics, right now, I know, with the confirmation hearings and the repeal Obamacare efforts starting to seem like it`s maybe going off the rails, and the protests against the new president in Washington and around the country, just the inauguration drama itself. There is a lot going on in inauguration week. But this is the last few days of the Obama administration and this really is a thing that is happening. The outgoing president is very quietly leaving a whole bunch, leaving of thousands of troops on Russia`s doorstep on his way out the door. And here`s the question – is the new president going to take those troops out? After all the speculation, after all the worry, we are actually about to find out if Russia maybe has something on the new president? We`re about to find out if the new president of our country is going to do what Russia wants once he`s commander-in-chief of the U.S. military starting noon on Friday. What is he going to do with those deployments? Watch this space. Seriously.",1,14068.0,2477.0,host,1.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-17
1,MADDOW," Today, we learned two new things about the Exxon CEO who has been nominated to be the secretary of state. The first thing we learned is that they`re going to vote on his nomination on Monday. Now, the math on this is easy, if all 10 Democrats on the committee vote no – which is possible – then just one Republican on the committee voting no would be enough to have Rex Tillerson`s nomination fail in the committee. Now, in almost all cases, failing in committee means the end of a nomination. And that brings us to the second thing we learned today about this nomination. The second thing we learned about it is that failure in committee in this case would not be a problem. Committee Chair Bob Corker today told CNN that Rex Tillerson will get a full Senate floor vote whether the committee approves him or not, which is good to know and important to know. What this means is that next Monday`s vote may be interesting. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida may yet have his chance to actually do something interesting and vote no on a nomination that he appears to have grave concerns about. But the Republicans in the Senate have decided they`re going to move it to the floor and approve him anyway even if that happens. Just to be clear, this is something they can do, but it would be very, very unusual for them to do it. This sort of thing is exceedingly rare. If you want to find the last cabinet member to be confirmed after failing in committee, you have to go all the way back to the Roosevelt administration in 1945. But it looks like they might bend over backwards and do that this year for Exxon. It really couldn`t happen to a nicer corporation or a bigger or more powerful one.

What got him in trouble were these satellite photos of construction of a Soviet nuclear aircraft carrier which he obtained in his Navy employment.

11,MADDOW," Samuel Morison was convicted in 1985. Samuel Morison then became the first government employee ever imprisoned for leaking classified information to the press. You heard in the package there, he did face 40 years in prison. When he actually got sentenced, though, he got sentenced to two years in prison and then after serving eight months, he got paroled. He was then pardoned by President Clinton in 2001. Then, there was Thomas Drake. Thomas Drake was a former NSA employee who said he had concerns about wasteful spending at the NSA. Motivated by those concerns, he said, he leaked information about the NSA to a reporter at “The Baltimore Sun.” Thomas Drake was cautious. He used encrypted e-mail to communicate with that reporter but his leak was discovered, anyway. He got indicted in 2010. He faced 35 years in prison, but in the end, he struck a plea deal, and all he got was 240 hours of community service, plus one year`s probation. Then, there`s John Kiriakou. He was a CIA analyst. In 2012, he was charged with leaking classified information about a fellow CIA officer. Mr. Kiriakou served two years in federal prison. There are other people who leaked classified information to the press, for a variety of reasons, whistle-blowers or not. There are a lot of them who got much lighter sentences then Chelsea Manning did in August, 2013. Private First Class Manning was sentenced to 35 years in her late case. And that case was a very big deal. It was a huge amount of information, more than 700 files, including about 250,000 diplomatic cables from American embassies around the world. Dossiers detailing intelligence assessments about prisoners at Guantanamo, video of an American helicopter attack in Baghdad that killed two journalists. The Manning leak wasn`t generically to the press or even to an individual press organization of the kind we usually expect with leaks like this. It was to the organization WikiLeaks. And we think of WikiLeaks with a lot of different associations now, right? They went on to become a whole different kind of political deal. Their editor-in-chief Julian Assange went into exile to avoid rape charges in Scandinavia and then despite his exile in an Ecuadorian embassy, WikiLeaks became apparently a vehicle for the Russian government`s efforts to interfere with our election this year. That all happened after Chelsea Manning leaked classified information to WikiLeaks for which she earned 35 years in prison, an unheard of sentence for somebody charged with leaking government information. Well, now, today, we`ve gotten two big pieces of information about those two last people I mentioned. President Obama today commuted Chelsea Manning`s sentence. She will be released in May after serving approximately seven years in prison. That`s one big piece of information. But then there`s this from WikiLeaks. Last Thursday, as news started to circulate that Chelsea Manning might be being considered for a commutation or a pardon, the group tweeted this, quote, “If Obama grants Manning clemency, Julian Assange will agree to U.S. extradition despite clear unconstitutionality of the Department of Justice`s case.” Just a short time ago, the group also tweeted this about the extradition deal, saying that according to Mr. Assange`s lawyer, everything that Julian Assange has said, he is standing by. Two big pieces of news, presumably more on the way. Joining us now is Charlie Savage, national security and legal reporter for “The New York Times”, the author of “Power Wars: Inside Obama`s Post-9/11 Presidency.” Mr. Savage, thank you for being here.",1,3600.0,588.0,host,12.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-17

13,MADDOW, Is this an unexpected development from an administration that has been so aggressive in prosecuting people for leaking government information.,1,143.0,21.0,host,14.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-17
14,SAVAGE," Unexpected in the sense that just as you said they`ve already at this point prosecuted nine or ten leak cases, that`s double depending on how you count it, all previous presidents combined. And so, ending an administration, both with this commutation and, as you mentioned earlier in your show, the pardon for General Cartwright who was not charged with leaking but the lying to the FBI arose in the context of a leak investigation, is an interesting twist at the end of Obama`s time in power because he will be remembered as a president who presided over tremendous criminalization of leaks. Not unexpected in the last couple day, there have been rumblings about Manning. I think you already played or maybe it was the earlier show Josh Earnest talking on Friday and carefully distinguishing or making an argument for distinguishing Ed Snowden from Chelsea Manning in terms of both of them requesting clemency. And that was a sign they were taking it seriously.",1,963.0,164.0,guest,15.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-17
15,MADDOW," You know, you`ve already seen some angry reaction to this. You`ve seen House Speaker Paul Ryan and other figures on the Hill come out and say that this is outrageous. That this sort of clemency shouldn`t have happened. That this leak was so damaging that any mercy is inappropriate here. But it seems like part of the argument being made by supporters of Manning`s and people who were supporting the decision is about the disproportionate nature of the sentence. That 35-year sentence looks for me just from a cursory reading of this stuff that that is very, very different from the other kinds of sentences that have been meted out by this administration or others in terms of this kind of crime.",1,698.0,123.0,host,16.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-17
16,SAVAGE," We don`t have a lot of cases to compare it to because until recently criminal prosecutions and especially successful ones of leakers was exceedingly rare. There`s about a dozen cases you can look at. Most cases that result in a conviction you`re looking at one year, two years, three years. I believe the longest other sentence, the next-longest sentence is three and a half years. So, the Manning sentence is an order of magnitude greater than anyone else has ever received. Of course, her leak was, to be fair, to be fulsome of our discussions, it was qualitatively different than most other leaks. She was a bulk leaker, not “here`s the secret” but “here`s all the secrets.” And it`s clear that the military and the prosecution was trying to throw the book at her and make an example out of her to deter this new kind of leak that she basically was the first to figure out could be done and did carry out.",1,909.0,165.0,guest,17.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-17

18,SAVAGE," Well, I`m not sure there are charges pending against him. There`s not been any kind of confirmed report.

23,MADDOW," The largest event held in Washington, D.C. was President Obama`s first inauguration in 2009, 1.8 million people in attendance to see Barack Obama sworn in as president for the first time, 1.8 million people. At this week`s inauguration, homeland security officials say they expect the crowd to be maybe 800,000 or 900,000 people. And that`s fine. That is impressive. That is a ton of people. Unless you have publicly called for your movement fans to set the all time record for crowd size at an inauguration, then getting less than half the size the crowd of your predecessor it probably doesn`t feel awesome. Last week, the incoming president said his inauguration day this week is turning out to be “even bigger than expected.” Then today, there was this, quote, “people are pouring in to Washington in record numbers, Bikers for Trump are on their way.” Bikers for Trump are on their way. That is not just short hand for anybody with a Harley and a red baseball hat tucked underneath their helmet. Bikers for Trump is an actual group with that actual name, Bikers for Trump. Now that is not to be confused with Bikers 4 Trump who Bikers for Trump say is actually a scam group. While we`re keeping track, consider also the two million bikers to D.C. which is a bitter rival of Bikers for Trump, which says that Bikers 4 Trump is a scam. So, you got all that? About the rival/scam Trump biker groups and their mutual recriminations? I should also mention that the Bikers for Trump group, they say they have received a permit to demonstrate at the inauguration on Friday. Their founder says more than 5,000 Bikers for Trump will be at the inauguration to form what he calls, quote, “a wall of meat” against any protesters along the inaugural parade route. So, that`s one thing to look forward to at the inauguration this year – a four stroke rolling defensive wall of meat. I don`t think they`re bringing meat. I think they think of themselves as meat. I think. But it`s possible the whole thing is kind of a hoax since a lot of the photos inspiring such confidence that the bikers are roaring into town appear to be photos of stuff like, you know, toy drives for kids from years ago. So, who knows whether the bikers will, in fact, provide a wall of meat at the inaugural parade? That is in the realm of “imagine if”, along with the new president calling for record attendance this Friday. For now, it`s all what if. But from the realm of math, we do have this new Monmouth poll that came out which says the incoming president has a favorability rating of just 34 percent. A new “Washington Post”/ABC poll says Donald Trump`s favorability is 40 percent. In that poll, that`s the lowest it`s been for any incoming president in their four decades of polling on this subject. CNN has the favorability a little bit higher but barely, they`ve got him at 44 percent. A new NBC/”Wall Street Journal” poll out tonight calls president Trump the most unpopular incoming president in the history of that poll as well. NBC/”Wall Street Journal” has him at 38 percent. Lowest ever. And you might think those polls are rigged, as the president-elect said today. You might say the bikers are on their way to form their “wall of meat”, but we are seeing a wave of protesters for and against this nomination descending on the capital, filling the streets. The National Park Service says they have provided 22 permits to first amendment groups for this week with more permits still pending. That`s way more permits than they have been given out before – and at least that part of this inauguration, that part having to do with protest against the incoming president, that is already planned to be the biggest ever.",1,3698.0,655.0,host,24.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-17
24,MADDOW," This was earlier this evening here in Washington, D.C. Three days out from the presidential inauguration, these are anti-Trump protesters who marched through much of downtown D.C. tonight. They held signs. They caused some road closures. Some protesters tonight ended up outside the president-elect`s downtown D.C. hotel. You see that guy holding a sign with an eye on it? Some people held protest signs that had the letter “I” on them. They said that represented what they say is the president-elect`s illegitimacy as president. Another protest in D.C. is scheduled to be held tomorrow afternoon. These protests in the streets are starting as the list of Democratic members of Congress who plan to boycott the inauguration continues to get longer by the day. Those aren`t the credits for the end of the show. Those are the members of Congress we know as of tonight aren`t going. NBC News confirms that at least 50 Democratic members of Congress have said they`ll skip Friday`s inauguration. We don`t think 50 would be a record, but we do think it`s the most in at least 40 years to stay away from a presidential inauguration.

29,BESCHLOSS," It does happen. In 1973, some members of Congress did stay home because they were angry at Richard Nixon about the fact that he had extended the Vietnam War for four more years through his first term and there were actually beer cans and beer bottles thrown at the presidential limousine. But that didn`t affect Nixon much politically because the war was over two days later, so that was a dead letter. I think the difference here is that if this inauguration turns into a big mess with a lot of protest and anger and what we remember of this is not a great unifying speech by a president and a lot of good feeling, but instead, a lot of bad feeling, that could really impair this president as he starts.",1,705.0,132.0,guest,30.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-17
30,MADDOW," One of the things that is hard to understand and also sort of hard to put in context about what we`re seeing with the president-elect`s approval numbers, is that, obviously, the big headline is there`s never been an incoming president in modern history of polling that`s had numbers this low.",1,293.0,51.0,host,31.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-17

37,BESCHLOSS," He threw this away. Because what a president usually uses the transition for is to say to the people who didn`t vote for him, “I`m better than you may think, I`m going to make appointments of people you may like, I`m going to say things that you like, you know, I want to give me a new chance.” Instead, what Donald Trump said was, you know, I`m going not going to pretend to do that. I`m going to put out tweets. I`m going to be combative. I`m going to strike some people as impulsive and a lot of people who might have been open to persuasion decided that they did not like Donald Trump. And so, you find this odd situation where he won the popular vote high 40s. These numbers of these polls are saying, you know, high 30s. That means if they`re reliable, some people who voted for him are walking away.",1,807.0,155.0,guest,38.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-17

44,MADDOW," Yes. And Obama number, I mean, just to put that in context, too, in historical terms, the Obama number at 1.8 was a remarkable number. Obviously, there were so many things about that moment in history and also he was – George W. Bush was incredibly unpopular, this new president was incredibly popular, the first African-American president, so many things made that possible. I don`t know that we`ll ever see that again. The next-closest record to that was like a third behind it. That was LBJ in 1965 with 1.2 million. So, nobody`s ever gotten close to what Barack Obama did in 2009, right? That`s an unattainable number for anybody any time soon.",1,649.0,114.0,host,45.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-17
45,BESCHLOSS," And unlikely to see something like that. It`s meaningful for Trump, because he has said, he`s relying on his presidential term by essentially being able to say to Congress, members of Congress, Republicans who don`t like him or who are skeptical of him, you know, you better vote with me on these controversial programs or else I`ll tell the voters in your district or state to vote against you. If his numbers are down, that`s a pretty weak threat and he`s going to have a hard time getting those passed.",1,506.0,91.0,guest,46.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-17

53,MADDOW," Maybe the first thing to know about the nominee to be secretary of education is that she`s sitting not just on one but two enormous family fortunes. Betsy DeVos is very, very, very wealthy, and for ethics officials, that sheer amount of her wealth and the sprawl of her financial interests makes her difficult to vet. I mean, you`ve got to know what she`s got in terms of assets and financial entanglements in order to know where she may have a conflict of interest with her new job. But how do you sort that out? “The New York Times” reports that Mrs. DeVos and her husband have investments in 250 companies that are registered to a single address in Grand Rapids, Michigan –250 companies at one address and that`s just one sliver of their holdings. “The Wall Street Journal” says she has indirect stake in a student loan company. Going to be education secretary? It`s complicated but the education secretary oversees the nation`s student loan program. It`s important to understand that Betsy DeVos has a conflict of interest there, or if she doesn`t. Another question here for Betsy DeVos, the more than $5 million in fines that her political action committee was ordered to pay for campaign finance violations several years ago. That PAC was part of a campaign over education in Ohio. The PAC says the old fines don`t matter anymore, but Senate Democrats are making an issue of that since she would now be secretary of education. Now that she`s about to become education secretary, it seems important to know all of that – the direct investments, the indirect investments, $5 million in fines related to an education-related campaign. If you check with the independent federal Office of Government Ethics, you will find a list of certified financial disclosures. These are the reports that they have gone through and signed off on for nominees. And at the top of this list are the most recent nominees from the incoming administration. Steve Mnuchin, the guy who would be treasury secretary, he`s there. Elaine Chao is there. Congressman Price is there. Betsy DeVos is not there, not on that list. Her investments, her financial forms haven`t gotten that certified stamp of approval from the Office of Government Ethics. Apparently, they are still working on it, and yet, there she was tonight on Capitol Hill testifying in front of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. She testified even though senators on this committee don`t have a full report on her finances and her financial vetting. That`s unusual. It`s not unheard of but that is unusual. And this committee she`s up against tonight is a tough lineup. Look at the Democratic line up on this committee. Patty Murray, Bernie Sanders, Al Franken, Chris Murphy, Tim Kaine, Elizabeth Warren, and they apparently came ready to make this a contact sport this evening.",1,2846.0,482.0,host,54.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-17

64,MADDOW," Democrats have said they intend to ask a lot of questions of the cabinet nominees for the new administration. They intend to conduct a thorough grilling. Tonight, we got a taste of what they mean by that. Tomorrow, it will be Tom Price`s turn to face the same Senate committee. Tom Price has been nominated to be the new healthy secretary. Tonight, citing many mounting questions about Congressman Price`s investments in health companies and the corruption questions surround them, Democrats on that committee are asking to have the Tom Price hearing postponed until they get more information on his stock trading and whether or not it was corrupting. We have no word yet on whether they will get that delay. But if they don`t, we`ll have the Tom Price round tomorrow. I wonder what they will ask him about.",1,808.0,140.0,host,65.0,0,MSNBC,The Rachel Maddow Show,2017-01-17
65,MADDOW," Last time we counted, there were five Goldman Sachs alum joining the new White House. Senior strategist in the White House, Goldman Sachs. Nominee for treasury secretary, Goldman Sachs. Head of the National Economic Council, the president of Goldman Sachs. Head of the SEC, which is the top cop that polices Wall Street, he`s a former lawyer for Goldman Sachs. After those four, the Trump administration created a new adviser job at the White House for another partner at Goldman Sachs. That brings us to five Goldman Sachs hires for the new populist-looking-out-for-the-little-guy White House. But then, remarkably enough, they found another one, another Goldman Sachs guy will now be taking over the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs. Goldman Sachs hire number six. This week, the new hire could be found in Davos, with other masters of the universe. While in Davos, he gave an interview to a Russian state-run news agency saying that the U.S. sanctions on Russia haven`t worked, that sanctions have probably galvanized Russians with the Russian president, whatever that means. He also said maybe he could help arrange for new U.S. investments in a Russian investment funds, which by the way, the U.S. put sanctions on in 2015 – but, hey, this is a new day. This is the day of Goldman Sachs alums sliding into federal government with nameplates and business cards, half dozen of them so far, which presents sort of a new challenge. If this comes up, we may need a new collective work for a group of Goldman Sachs people, you know, like flock or heard or pack, like a portfolio of Goldman Sachs hires, or a hedge, or a hedge of Goldman Sachs hire, a purse, a gamble, an anti-regulatory framework. I don`t know. I don`t – what do you call it when you hire six people from Goldman Sachs one right after the other? Send us your suggestion. Send us your best and most printable suggestions for the collective noun we need a blank of Goldman Sachs hires.
