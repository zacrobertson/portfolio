7,WALLACE," And hello again from Fox News in Washington.  The Trump administration says it's prepared to do more after this week's missile barrage on the Syrian air base meant to deter President Bashar Assad from again using chemical weapons against his own people. The question this hour is: what happens next?  In a few minutes, we’ll ask one of the key figures who helped President Trump plan the attack, General H.R. McMaster, in his first television interview since becoming the president's national security advisor.  But, first, let's bring in Fox News correspondent Kristin Fisher live from Palm Beach with the latest from the southern White House -- Kristin. ",1,657.0,112.0,host,6.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
8,"KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRRESPONDENT"," Chris, residents of the same Syrian town hit in that chemical weapons attack say warplanes have returned to bomb them, though this time without the deadly gas. And it has the world wondering how President Trump will respond.  In a letter to Congress, he defended his decision to launch almost 60 Tomahawk missiles at a single Syrian air base without congressional approval by saying, quote, ""I acted in the vital national security and foreign policy interest of the United States pursuant to my constitutional authority."" He then said that, quote, ""The U.S. will take additional action as necessary and appropriate to further its important national interests.""  As the president mulls over what those additional actions might be, the Pentagon is investigating if Russia was involved in that chemical weapons attack. Senior military officials say a Russian drone was seen flying over the hospital where victims of the attack were taken. A few hours later, it was bombed. The Kremlin is denying any responsibility.  Now, Russia is flexing its muscles by sending a warship towards the two Navy destroyers that launched the strike on Syria. And all of this just days before Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is scheduled to take his first trip to Moscow. The State Department says Tillerson called his Russian counterpart yesterday and the trip is still on and he will be bringing a very powerful message with him, that President Trump is willing to take decisive military action any time a country crosses his redline -- Chris. ",1,1525.0,256.0,guest,7.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
9,WALLACE," Kristin Fisher, reporting live from Palm Beach -- Kristin, thanks for that.  Joining me live now from Mar-a-Lago, President Trump's national security advisor, H.R. McMaster.  General, welcome to ""Fox News Sunday."" ",1,215.0,35.0,host,8.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
10,"LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR"," Thank you, Chris. It's a pleasure to be with you. ",1,51.0,12.0,guest,9.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
11,WALLACE," The Trump administration seems to be sending mixed signals this weekend. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley says that getting rid of Assad is a priority. On the other hand, Secretary of State Tillerson says that first, we have to get rid of ISIS, destroy ISIS, Assad can wait.  So, which is it? How does the president see this playing out in Syria? ",1,343.0,64.0,host,10.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
12,MCMASTER," Well, both Secretary Tillerson and Ambassador Haley are right about this. What we really need to do, and what everyone who's involved in this conflict needs to do is to do everything they can to resolve this civil war, to halt this humanitarian catastrophe, this political catastrophe, not only in Syria, but the catastrophe is affecting the greater Middle East, it's affecting Europe and it's a threat to the American people as well.  And so, to do that, what's required is some kind of a political solution to that very complex problem. And what Ambassador Haley pointed out is it's very difficult to understand how a political solution could result from the continuation of the Assad regime.  Now, we are not saying that we are the ones who are going to affect that change. What we are saying is, other countries have to ask themselves some hard questions. Russia should ask themselves, what are we doing here? Why are we supporting this murderous regime that is committing mass murder of its own population and using the most heinous weapons available?  So, I think that while people are really anxious to find -- to find inconsistencies in the statements, they are in fact very consistent in terms of what is the ultimate political objective in Syria. ",1,1258.0,220.0,guest,11.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
13,WALLACE, I understand that that's the ultimate political objective. But Secretary Tillerson said destroying ISIS must come first. You don't seem to be saying that. ,1,156.0,26.0,host,12.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
14,MCMASTER," No, that's exactly what we are saying. We have seen what ISIS does, right, how ISIS brutalize these people, how ISIS has now established control of territory and populations and resources and grown in strength and is threat to all civilized peoples. So, we are conducting very effective operations alongside our partners in Syria and in Iraq to defeat ISIS, to destroy ISIS and reestablish control of that territory, control of those populations, protect those populations, allow refugees to come back, begin reconstruction and allow the resources -- ",1,552.0,90.0,guest,13.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
15,,(CROSSTALK),1,,,,,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
16,WALLACE," But, sir, I’m just trying to clear this up -- is it two separate tracks at the same time or does ISIS have to happen first before we and the international community moved to depose Assad? ",1,189.0,38.0,host,14.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
17,MCMASTER," Well, I think as you saw with the strike, that there has to be a degree of simultaneous activity as well as sequencing of the defeat of ISIS first. What you have in Syria is a very destructive cycle of violence perpetuated by ISIS, obviously, but also by this regime and their Iranian and Russian sponsors. And so, what we have to be able to do is to work together with our allies and partners to help resolve this conflict and the resolution of the conflict will tell each of the elements that you are talking about, Chris, the defeat of ISIS, and then also, it has to be a significant change in the nature of the Assad regime and its behavior in particular. ",1,661.0,126.0,guest,15.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
18,WALLACE," But let me ask you a question, sir, which may clarify this, because as Kristin Fisher reported, Syrian warplanes are already using that same base that you and the U.S. forces hit Thursday night and they are reportedly again bombing that same town in northern Syria, but only this time with conventional weapons, not chemical. The question is, if Assad continues killing babies only with conventional weapons, not chemical, will this president stop that, or will President Trump say he's going to do nothing, stand aside? ",1,522.0,88.0,host,16.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
19,MCMASTER," Well, I think what's important to remember is, our objective -- our objective was to deter the continued use, because there's been a pattern of the abuse of chemical weapons by the Assad regime and his mass murder attacks against innocent civilians. That was the objective.  And I think Ambassador Haley, Secretary Tillerson -- everyone has confirmed that we are prepared to do more. In fact, we are prepared to do more. In fact, we are prepared to more two days ago as well.  And so, what's significant about the strike is not that it was meant to take out the Syrian regime's capacity or ability to commit mass murder of its own people, but it was to be a very strong signal to Assad and his sponsors that the United States cannot stand idly by as he is murdering innocent civilians -- what was a redline in 2013. And so, that was the important objective to keep in mind here.  The other significant thing about this though -- ",1,930.0,174.0,guest,17.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
20,,(CROSSTALK),1,,,,,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
21,WALLACE," He is continuing the mass murder. So, the question is, if he uses conventional weapons, is President Trump prepared to stop him from using conventional weapons to slaughter innocent civilians? ",1,194.0,32.0,host,18.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
22,MCMASTER," Well, I think with this president -- what we have is someone was helping us understand helping us provide him with an assessment of what is the degree of agency and control we have over this very complex situation. The president has, in response to a mass murder attack, acted decisively.  And if they're using that airfield, that's -- I mean, that’s not what the objective was, to take out the airfield forever. The objective was to send a very strong political message to Assad. And this is -- this is very significant I think because I think everyone should realize this is the first time the United States has acted directly against the Assad regime, and that should be a strong message to Assad and to his sponsors who are enabling his campaign of mass murder against his own civilians. ",1,793.0,144.0,guest,19.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
23,WALLACE," So, there is a possibility that President Trump, you are saying -- leaving it wide open that he will act against President Assad if he goes against civilians no matter what weapon he uses?",1,189.0,35.0,host,20.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
24,MCMASTER," Well, the president will make whatever decision he thinks is in the best interest of the American people, and it will be our job to provide him with options based on how we see this conflict evolve in this period of time before us, after the strike. And what we're doing now is working with our partners, our allies, everyone, except Russia and Iran, who are somehow continue to think that it's OK to be aligned with his murderous regime.  We are working with our parties and allies to magnify the effects of this strike to -- and then to build momentum toward ultimately resolving the civil war, defeating ISIS and bringing the peace and security back to this region and to the Syrian people. ",1,695.0,128.0,guest,21.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
25,WALLACE," Let me bring in -- you mentioned Russia. Russia has sent, as Kristin Fisher reported, has sent a warship into the Mediterranean. And over the weekend, the prime minister of Russia, Medvedev, wrote, the U.S. is, quote, ""on the verge of a military clash with Russia.""  Sir, what are we prepared to do if Russia defends its interests in Syria? ",1,342.0,63.0,host,22.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
26,MCMASTER," Well, this is part of the problem with Syria is Russia's sponsorship for this murderous regime.  And if we would want to appeal rationally to Russia, this is a great opportunity for the Russian leadership to reevaluate what they’re doing. Why they are supporting a regime that is committing mass murder against its own people. And so, Russia could be part of the solution. Right now, I think everyone in the world sees Russia as part of the problem. ",1,451.0,82.0,guest,23.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
27,WALLACE, Was Russia involved? Do we have evidence that they were involved in the chemical attack? ,1,90.0,17.0,host,24.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
28,MCMASTER," Well, I think what we should do is ask Russia -- how could it be, if you have advisors at that airfield, that you didn't know that the Syrian air force was preparing and executing a mass murder attack with chemical weapons? I think we ought to ask them a question. ",1,266.0,53.0,guest,25.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
29,WALLACE," President Trump, as you well know, talk to during the campaign and since about trying to establish an alliance with Vladimir Putin and he indicated that there was some kind of moral equivalence between the two nations.  Here he is. ",1,233.0,43.0,host,26.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09

33,TRUMP, There are a lot of killers. We've got a lot of killers. Why? You think our country is so innocent? ,1,100.0,22.0,guest,29.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
34,,(END VIDEO CLIP),1,,,,,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
35,WALLACE," General, what is our relationship with Russia and Putin today? ",1,64.0,12.0,host,30.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
36,MCMASTER," Well, today, it can be whatever the Russians want it to be. Do they want it to be a relationship of competition and potential conflict? I don't see how that's in Russian interest. Or do they want it to be where a relationship in which we can find areas of cooperation that are -- that are in our mutual interest?  How is it in anyone's interest that this conflict in Syria and this catastrophe in the greater Middle East continue?  And they can be part of the solution or they can continue what has been really a very sophisticated campaign of subversion against Western interests and a campaign of subversion and intervention on behalf of a murderous regime in the Middle East.  And so, I think this is what our secretary of state will be exploring with the Russian leadership this week and the president is determined to do everything he can to advance American interests. And if that entails working with others to come to solutions in the world that enhance our security, the president will do that. And it's really now up to the Russian leadership to reevaluate what they are doing in the Middle East. ",1,1108.0,203.0,guest,31.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
37,WALLACE," I want to turn -- this all overshadowed the fact that the missile strike happened in the midst of a summit between President Trump and Chinese President Xi. And during dinner, the president told President Xi about the attack. Did President Xi give any indication that he now takes President Trump statement more seriously that if China doesn't act to stop North Korea's nuclear program, that he, President Trump, will? Did you get the sense that they were taking that more seriously, and also we learned this morning that a U.S. carrier strike force is on its way to the Korean Peninsula, why? ",1,595.0,105.0,host,32.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
38,MCMASTER," Well, it is such a privilege to be part of this national security team and help enable this team for the president as national security advisor. It's really extraordinary. I think the degree of concurrent activity that was going on this week and nobody really even broke a sweat over it. I mean, we have extraordinarily competent people in these positions who are providing the president with options and then can -- then have this amazing military that we have that can execute those decisions of the president flawlessly.  And so, it was, I think, maybe a bit surprising to the guests here about how really no one was really even stressed out or anything about the need to conduct this operation in the wake of this murderous attack. And I think the summit was extremely successful, because it met the first objective, which is to allow the president and Premier Xi to build a relationship that they can use to identify areas of cooperation and to advance really our mutual interests, but American interest in particular. These are key areas. ",1,1046.0,184.0,guest,33.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
39,WALLACE," And I’m running out of time. So, I’ve got to ask you sort of lightning round -- quick questions, quick answers.  Why the carrier strike force to the Korean Peninsula? ",1,168.0,33.0,host,34.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
40,MCMASTER," Well, it’s prudent to do it, isn't it? I mean, North Korea has been engaged in a pattern of provocative behavior. This is -- this is a rogue regime that is now a nuclear capable regime, and President Xi and President Trump agreed that that is unacceptable, that what must happen is the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And so, the president has asked to be prepared to give him a full range of options to remove that threat the American people and to our allies and partners in the region. ",1,500.0,93.0,guest,35.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
41,WALLACE," Finally, you know, you’ve got China, you’ve got Syria, you’ve got Russia, but a lot of people in Washington are talking about relations inside the White House -- welcome to the D.C. politics, General McMaster -- why did you push for Steve Bannon to be taken off the principals committee of the National Security Council? ",1,322.0,57.0,host,36.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
42,MCMASTER," Well, this is not as significant as it appears, I think. But I think what the president was making clear that he is going -- in terms of permanent membership of National Security Council -- have those permanent members who are for every meeting, every official meeting of the National Security Council, to be those who will give him their advice on the long-term interests of the American people.  And so, really, though, you know, it depends -- the president can get advice from anybody he wants, and he does that. He asked a broad range of people who he trusts, and Steve Bannon is one of them, about policy decisions and about the risks and opportunities involved with each of these. So, none of that has changed. ",1,718.0,131.0,guest,37.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
43,WALLACE, But do you think it was inappropriate to have a political advisor in that role? ,1,81.0,17.0,host,38.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
44,MCMASTER," Well, no, I think what is appropriate is to have in that role -- whoever the president wants in that role. And there -- and Steve Bannon provides the president with advice on a broad range of issues and will continue to do so. ",1,228.0,46.0,guest,39.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
45,WALLACE," General McMaster, thank you. We covered a long-range of issues today. Thank you for your time, sir, and we’ll follow what happens next in Syria and around the world. ",1,167.0,31.0,host,40.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09

47,WALLACE, Coming up: should Congress have had a say before the U.S. missile attack? Demand from both sides: the president consult them before he acts again. Two leading senators join us next.,1,182.0,32.0,host,42.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09

49,WALLACE," Just as President Trump launched that missile attack in Syria, Senate Republicans employed the nuclear option to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.  Joining us now: two Senate leaders to discuss both developments. From Austin, Texas, the number two Republican in the Senate, John Cornyn, and here in Washington, Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.  Senator Cardin, you just heard the president's national security advisor, General McMaster. Are you satisfied that they have a clear plan for how to proceed in Syria? ",2,554.0,91.0,host,43.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
50,"SEN. BEN CARDIN, D-MARYLAND"," Not at all. I don’t -- I don't think he articulated a Syrian strategy. What we saw was a reaction to the use of chemical weapons, something I think many of us supported. But what we did not see is a coherent policy on how we’re going to deal with the civil war and also deal with ISIS. ",2,287.0,60.0,guest,44.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
51,WALLACE," I want to ask you about that, as well, Senator Cornyn, because as I said, there were these mixed messages that have come out this weekend from the administration. Haley is talking about deposing Assad, Tillerson talking about taking out ISIS first. Do you have a clear sense of what the administration's policy is? ",2,316.0,56.0,host,45.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
52,"SEN. JOHN CORNYN, R-TEXAS"," Well, first and foremost, I think it's to send a message to Assad and to the Russians, the Iranians and North Koreans that there's a new administration in charge of our national security policy. I applaud the president for doing what he did to enforce that red line that President Obama drew three years ago, but did nothing to enforce.  But I think that, along with my friend, Ben Cardin, Congress needs to work with the president to try and deal with this long-term strategy, lack of strategy, really, in Syria. We haven't had one for six years during the Obama administration, and the 400,000 civilians have died and millions of people have been displaced internally and externally in Europe and elsewhere.  So, we definitely need a strategy. We need to work with the White House to come up with one that has bipartisan support. ",2,833.0,149.0,guest,46.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
53,WALLACE," Well, let's talk about that, because while most senators, including the two of you, I think supported this particular strike under these specific circumstances, there was concern from both sides of the aisle about whether President Trump gets more deeply involved, whether or not he needs authorization from Congress to do so.  Here was Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer this week. ",2,381.0,63.0,host,47.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09

55,"SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-NY, SENATE MINORITY LEADER"," It is now, however, incumbent on the Trump administration to come up with a coherent strategy and consult with Congress before implementing it. ",2,145.0,25.0,guest,48.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
56,,(END VIDEO CLIP),2,,,,,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
57,WALLACE," Senator Cornyn, is Schumer right? Does the White House need approval from Congress if it's going to get more deeply involved in Syria? ",2,136.0,25.0,host,49.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
58,CORNYN," Well, under the War Resolutions Act, which the president sent a letter pursuant to that act yesterday explaining his actions, it is required, and I think it also makes good sense. Before we commit our military and our men and women in uniform to any sort of conflict, they deserve the support of Congress on a bipartisan basis, as well as the support of the American people. So, that's why that sort of consultation and advice is so important. ",2,445.0,81.0,guest,50.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
59,WALLACE," Senator Cardin, let me pick up on this with you, because President Obama and now President Trump both authorized widespread force across the Middle East based on an approval that was given by Congress right after 9/11. This is 15 years later. Does that cover moving against the Assad regime or does the president made new approval? And an important question, because as we remember, when President Obama went to Congress back in 2013 to enforce the red line, it was clear Congress wasn't going to approve it. Do you think if the president went to Congress now, that Democrats, Republicans would pass resolutions supporting the use of force to depose Bashar Assad? ",2,665.0,115.0,host,51.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
60,CARDIN," Chris, you asked a couple of questions. First, in regards to the 2001 authorization, it's been interpreted by the Obama administration, I assume also the Trump administration, to cover the use of force against ISIS in Syria. Many of us disagree with that and believe Congress should pass a separate resolution dealing with ISIS, that we shouldn’t be using the 9/11 resolution for that purpose.  In regards of going against Assad-Syria, there is no congressional authorization. There is no authority to use force. The president has some inherent Article 2 to powers, but as he consulted with us by notice on this attack, it's incumbent upon him to consult with Congress. And if there's going to be a use of force on a continuing basis, he needs the authorization. ",2,764.0,132.0,guest,52.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
61,WALLACE," And do you think the House and Senate, Democrats as well as Republicans, would authorize the use of force? ",2,108.0,21.0,host,53.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
62,CARDIN," I think it depends upon seeing a plan from the president on Syria that can get the support of Congress and then how force is used as part of implementing that strategy. We have neither. We have -- we don’t have overall strategy, and we don't have the request for use of force. ",2,278.0,55.0,guest,54.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
63,WALLACE," Well, there was another big story this week, and I want to address that with both of you now, and that was, the Senate Republicans invoking the nuclear option, changing the rules of the Senate to confirm Neil Gorsuch as the next justice to the Supreme Court. Here was that moment in the Senate. ",2,296.0,56.0,host,55.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09

I want to talk about the impact of this going forward -- doesn't this ensure that the next time the president gets an opening, if his party controls the Senate, that he’s going to appoint somebody even more ideological, even more to the extreme, if you will, wing of his base because he doesn't have to worry about getting bipartisan support, doesn't have to worry about reaching out to the other party? ",2,533.0,97.0,host,57.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
68,CORNYN," Well, Chris, this is really a restoration of the status quo before the George W. Bush administration, when there was no such thing as filibustering judges, particular judges on the Supreme Court. Clarence Thomas got 52 votes when he was confirmed. One senator could have required 60 votes under the theory that basically was developed under Chuck Schumer and Democratic leadership to the George Bush administration.  But I think there is no danger of that happening. What it means is when we elect the president, we know that they’re going to be the ones who get to nominate judges. And they’re going to get support for that, at least 51 votes. But here, Judge Gorsuch got bipartisan support, 54 votes in the Senate, for his confirmation and he deserves -- he deserved it. ",2,774.0,136.0,guest,58.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
69,WALLACE," Senator Cardin, I want to ask about the strategy here. And I know there were some Democrats who said, maybe we shouldn't filibuster Gorsuch because the thought was, well, then, the fact that we haven't done it will lead President Trump to nominate, if there is a number opening, someone more moderate.  Have you made a strategic mistake here in the sense that now, President Trump knows I can nominate anyone -- almost anyone I want and get 51 votes, a bare majority of the Senate, and they’ll get through? ",2,508.0,93.0,host,59.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
70,CARDIN," Well, John Cornyn is my friend, and I mean that, but we disagree on this issue. I think damage has been done in the future nominees for the Supreme Court. I think damage has been done to the Senate as an institution, which is important for our country. I think that -- ",2,270.0,54.0,guest,60.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
71,WALLACE," But didn’t you do some of the damage? I don’t mean you, but the Democrats, by filibustering? ",2,94.0,19.0,host,61.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
72,CARDIN," Both the Democrats and Republicans have blame here. Both Democrats and Republicans have handled things in a way that shouldn’t have been done. We should change our rules by bipartisan. We shouldn't change the rules to accomplish a purpose.  And this has been going on. The ultimate filibuster was Merrick Garland's filibuster when he didn't even get a hearing or vote in the United States Senate by less than a majority of the U.S. senators holding him up. So, we've seen this go back to when President Obama’s first year for second term, Republicans said we’re not going to confirm any more court of appeals for the district court.

73,WALLACE, And you invoke the nuclear option. ,2,36.0,8.0,host,63.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
74,CARDIN," We did. So, we've seen this pattern. You see more filibusters for judicial nominees by the Republicans under President Obama than we saw in the whole history of the United State Senate. Both sides have blame here. ",2,215.0,39.0,guest,64.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
75,WALLACE," All right. I want to get into one last subject with both of you and the time we have left. When you get back from this two-week recess that you're taking, we’re going to have less than one week to pass the spending bill. If you failed to do so, the government is going to shut down.  Senator Cardin, if the White House insist, as they are at this point about including funding for building that wall along the southern border, for having sharp domestic spending cuts in order to offset a defense spending increase, will you block that even if it means the government shutdown? ",2,578.0,109.0,host,65.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
76,CARDIN," Well, first, I’m not sure the president has the majority of the United States Senate that will support funding a wall, because I talked to enough Republicans to know, and they’ve said it publicly, that’s a waste of money and it's counterproductive. So, I think the Senate will carry out its will and hopefully provide no money, no taxpayer money for building a wall. ",2,368.0,66.0,guest,66.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
77,WALLACE," But to answer my direct question: if a choice between putting money in for the wall, having those domestic spending cuts, would you go for a shutdown? ",2,152.0,29.0,host,67.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
78,CARDIN," I want to see government -- I don't want to see a government shutdown. I’m willing to make compromises in order to keep government functioning. But we have to take a look at their trade-offs. So, I can't answer that, in fact, until I see everything that’s in the bill. ",2,270.0,52.0,guest,68.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
79,WALLACE," Senator Cornyn, are those issues that I just mentioned, worth shutting down the government or would you support leaving some of them out in order to keep the government functioning? ",2,183.0,32.0,host,69.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
80,CORNYN," I think this is a test for the new Democratic leader, Senator Chuck Schumer, as well as the administration. They’re going to be the ones ultimately who negotiate this. But there’s not going to be a shutdown. I’m confident that we’ll come up with something that everybody can live with. ",2,287.0,52.0,guest,70.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09

Bill Kristol from The Weekly Standard, Fox News political analyst and columnist for The Hill, Juan Williams, Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, and Washington Examiner contributor Lisa Boothe.  Phil, you heard General McMaster, the national security advisor, at the top of the show. Are you satisfied that this administration has a clear strategy for going forward in Syria particularly the question I asked, which was, is this just about chemical weapons or is the president prepared to act if there's just, by conventional means, the slaughter of civilians?

95,"BILL KRISTOL, THE WEEKLY STANDARD"," I think they've at least done what they had to have done to lay the predicate for having a clear strategy. They haven’t worked it all out, but if he had not acted now, we would be in even worse shape than after President Obama didn't enforce his red line. It was such a visible violation of its national norms and what Syria had committed to when it allegedly got rid of all these chemical weapons.  So let them work out the strategy.

McMaster as national security advisor could really be an important moment because looking at from the outside, what struck me, and I think you -- you noted this too, Chris, during the week, it seemed like this was -- there was a crisis and they handled it competently. You could agree or disagree. Do they have a long term strategy? How knows. ",4,479.0,93.0,guest,83.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09

103,"JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST"," Well, I think that if you're sitting there having lunch and dinner, as President Xi of China was, it’s got to send some kind of message, especially with regard to North Korea.  Now, if you look on the world, there are a lot of hot spots, though, and there a lot of reasons for the U.S. to exercise some moral authority. President Trump as a candidate said if it's not about U.S. economic interest, if it's not about U.S. national security interest, it's no business of the Untied States. And as you know, he encouraged President Obama, don’t get involved with Syria. So there is no doctrine, Chris. And when I was listening to your interview with McMaster, I looked forward to it because I wanted to understand, what is the rationale, how do they sell this to the American people, how do they sell it to the person asking the question this morning? And there is none. He doesn’t say, you know what, conventional weapons are continuing to kill people in Syria and we find this abhorrent and we will stop it. No, he did not say that to you. he doesn’t -- he's not clear what the next step is. ",4,1092.0,205.0,guest,87.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09

109,WALLACE," Lisa, that's what I want to talk about with you is, where the Senate goes from here, particularly on Supreme Court nominations. This is something I brought up with the two senators in the last segment. It seems to me, and this isn't just Trump and Republicans, it will be true of the next Democratic president when he is a Democratic majority. Doesn't this increase the likelihood that when a president’s in that situation, he’s going to appoint somebody that is more to the extreme, more to -- in line with his base, because he doesn't have to -- he or she doesn't have to reach out to the other side because they know there’s not going to be a filibuster? ",4,659.0,123.0,host,91.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
110,BOOTHE," Yes, potentially. But, I mean, you also have to look at the fact that really prior -- going back to 2003, prior to Miguel Estrada, no judicial nominee with a clear majority had essentially been blocked by a filibuster. Then you also go to 2006 with President Obama leading the filibuster attempt against Justice Alito. And then it was the Democratic Party in 2013 that changed the rules for the lower court. I mean --",4,418.0,76.0,guest,92.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09
111,WALLACE," I now. I mean this goes back and forth. There’s nobody with clean hands here. Cardin’s right. But my point is, going forward, there was at least this self-limiting factor.

112,BOOTHE," I mean, yes, potentially, but I don't necessarily think -- I don’t think the onus is on the Republican Party. I think we’re just seeing politics as a whole getting increasingly more partisan. But the point being is going back to 2003, you really didn’t see the filibuster being used in a partisan manner. So I -- you know, I don't know if this is fundamentally changing the rules when you just go back to 2003, where we really saw at least a party using it for, you know, sort of a bipartisan weapon.",4,501.0,95.0,guest,94.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09

My party has a lot of blame for the way it -- it acted. And I think maybe the filibuster may have been a -- a poor judgment. I also think the Republicans -- I mean the fact that Merrick Garland was -- couldn't even get a hearing, right, and we do go back and forth.  I'm -- I’m usually a fairly optimistic guy. This is a case where I am very optimistic. You hear senators now saying, well, we went nuclear on nominations, there's no way that's going to happen on legislation. I'm not so sure, right? What’s going to happen the first time there's a contentious piece of legislation that’s up there and the partisan heels dig in even more? I think we are -- we are entering a very tenuous time for the United States Senate where it is going to become a lot more raucous and I don't think that's necessarily a good thing when there's a lot of raucousness around now in this town that needs to be checked.

Let’s be honest, with all of the big events, this is really what’s got Washington buzzing, this apparent split inside the White House between the so-called nationalist, led by Steve Bannon on the -- appropriately on the right there, and the so-called New Yorkers, or Democrats, led by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, over the direction of the Trump presidency.

125,KRISTOL," I think it's bad or at least dramatic. I don’t know if Bannon will be -- he’ll be, I think, pushed aside some. I doubt if he’ll be forced out immediately. What shows me who has the upper hand is this. I saw a New York Times -- it was a New Times story, I think it was today or yesterday, and the sort of -- the slug (ph) that once saw going in you know originally was, Trump had called it -- these two top aides and told them, work it out.

127,KRISTOL," So I saw that and I thought, well, the two aides who had to work it out obviously were Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner. Those are the two guys who at loggerheads. No, Trump had called in Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus and told them to work it out with Jared Kushner. Now, what does that tell you? You’ve been around organizations a while. Kushner is and the driver's seat. Trump is telling his chief of staff at this top strategist, you get along with Jared Kushner. So Jared Kushner in my -- to my -- in my opinion is the most powerful man in domestic policy at least in the White House today. ",4,596.0,116.0,guest,109.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-09

129,BOOTHE," Personally, I don't think it's as significant as it's being made out to be because the reality -- everyone -- everyone is basically putting this at the premise of somehow, you know, President Trump is being, you know, is a puppet of either Steve Bannon or Priebus, or whoever's in charge, Jared Kushner. The reality is, this is a guy -- I think people are under -- they’re not getting enough credit. This is a guy, in 2012, who trademarked make America great again. A guy who defeated 16 candidates in the primary, who defeated Hillary Clinton, who outspent him two to one. And if you include outside groups, three to one. And did all this with three separate campaign managers. I mean so this is a guy who's very smart politically, who’s a lot more adept than anyone wants to give him credit for.

And there are legitimate questions about that with respect to the ongoing controversy over what House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes know about possible surveillance of Trump aides and how he came about getting that information, news you may recall claim to have such compelling information he needed to rush to the White House and tell the president himself. But he did that without sharing what he found with fellow members of the Intelligence Committee, which is highly unusual.  This as FOX News has confirmed that Nunes received key information from a pair of White House aides, calling into question not only his relationship with the administration, but his ability to be impartial. As this investigation unfolds, concerns further complicated by his decision to delay former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates from testifying about possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign, hearings that would have included former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA Director John Brennan.

26,MCCONNELL," It's just not necessary, based on what we know now. We've got a bipartisan investigation underway. It's called the Senate Intelligence Committee. Senator Burr and Senator Warner had a joint press conference this week. I think they clearly laid out that they're going wherever the facts take them. We don't need yet another investigation.

My counterpart, Senator Schumer, once called that the gold standard.  In the majority, 99 percent of the time. Ninety-seven percent of his rulings were unanimous. Only reversed one time in a case in which he participated by the Supreme Court. President Obama's former acting solicitor general said there's no principle reason to oppose him. That's why he will ultimately be confirmed. Exactly how that happens, Chris, will be up to our Democratic colleagues. I think it is noteworthy that no Supreme Court justice has ever, in the history of our country, been stopped by a partisan filibuster, ever. And, in fact, the business of filibustering judges is a fairly recent invention, ironically, of the now minority in the Senate, the Democrats.",1,865.0,141.0,guest,25.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02

41,WALLACE," Now, you're prepared to do the same thing, break the rules -- change the rules to break the rules. And the question I have is, I understand you want Neil Gorsuch on the court, but is it worth it? Because what you're basically doing is destroying part of what makes the Senate special, the need to reach out to a bipartisan majority?",1,333.0,63.0,host,36.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
42,MCCONNELL," Well, the answer to your question is, of course, I was upset about their effort to break the rules in order to change the rules. But the rest of the story is, when we came to the majority a year and a half later, we discussed whether or not we should change it back.  And I argued against that precisely because the way we ended up was the way the Senate had operated on confirmations for 230 years, down to 2000. This business of filibustering judges and cabinet appointments is a recent phenomenon. Even though it was always possible, Chris, to filibuster executive branch appointments, it just wasn't done. And the most conspicuous example of that was the Clarence Thomas nomination. He was confirmed for the Supreme Court 52-48. Just for your listeners to know, all it takes to get a filibuster in the Senate is for any one of the 100 senators to say you have to get 60 votes. The most controversial Supreme Court nomination in history, not a single senator, not one, not Ted Kennedy, not Joe Biden, no one said you had to get 60 votes. So even though I very much disliked the way the Senate Democrats did this in 2013, it, in fact, it restored the practice -- the practice and the custom of the Senate down to 2000.",1,1221.0,227.0,guest,37.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
43,WALLACE," The government runs out of money on April 28, which means we could have another government shutdown on the 29th, which just coincidentally, would be Donald Trump's 99th day in office. How confident are you that you and Congress can avoid a government shutdown?",1,261.0,45.0,host,38.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
44,MCCONNELL," Yes, I'm very confident. The two appropriations committees are working on the bills on a bipartisan basis. We'll be talking to Senate Democrats. They will be relevant to this process. It will require 60 votes. I'm confident Senate Democrats are not going to want to shut down the government. They used to use that against us all the time. And I think it worked pretty effectively for them. And I can't imagine they would want to acquire the government shutdown label.",1,468.0,82.0,guest,39.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
45,WALLACE," But, look, there's some argument, they'll say it's you, the Republicans, who could make the shutdown happen. There are a number of priorities that President Trump and other Republicans want that Democrats find unacceptable. I want to go through a couple of them with you, Senator. One and a half billion dollars to start building the wall with Mexico, a major defense spending increase and domestic spending cuts. And some House conservatives want defunding of Planned Parenthood. Question, are you prepared to risk a government shutdown over any of those issues?",1,564.0,92.0,host,40.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
46,MCCONNELL," Look, we're going to negotiate all of those items in the context of this funding bill, which will fund the government through September 30. We'll be debating these issues again for next year's appropriations, we can start October 1. But we'll be able to work all that out. Nobody wants a government shutdown. I think the Senate Democrats know that every time we've had a government shutdown situation, it's been the Congress that's been blamed, and not the president. So I would advise President Trump, don't worry about them sticking that label on you. Congress owns the government shutdown brand. And there's no incentive, frankly, for either side to go to the brink. I think we're going to be able to work all this out later this month.",1,740.0,129.0,guest,41.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02

54,WALLACE," A look at Nationals Park, where Washington's finest have opening day tomorrow for the baseball season. But, there will be no presidential first pitch as the White House declined an invitation.  Mr. Trump, who once called global warming a hoax, signed a sweeping executive order this week calling for regulators to rewrite President Obama's climate change policies.  Joining me now from Oklahoma is Scott Pruitt, Mr. Trump's new administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency.  Mr. Pruitt, welcome to ""Fox News Sunday."" ",2,527.0,86.0,host,47.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
55,"SCOTT PRUITT, EPA ADMINISTRATOR"," Good morning, Chris. How are you? ",2,35.0,8.0,guest,48.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
56,WALLACE," Good.  When the Obama EPA announced its Clean Power Plan, it said that the reduction in carbon pollution would have the following health benefits. I want to put them up on the screen.  By 2030, it said there would be 90,000 fewer asthma attacks a year, 300,000 fewer missed work and school days, and 3,600 fewer premature deaths a year.  Without the Clean Power Plan, how are you going to prevent those terrible things? ",2,421.0,79.0,host,49.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
57,PRUITT," Well, Chris, I think what's important this past week is to recognize that the president is keeping his promise to the American people to rollback regulatory overreaches that have been occurring the last couple of years. And as you know, the Clean Power Plan is subject to a U.S. Supreme Court state. The steps have been taken by the EPA historically, they've equally been challenged several times with respective CO2 regulation. And each of those times the Supreme Court and courts have said that the power that has been used has been an overreach.  And so, the president is keeping his promise to deal with that overreach, Chris. It doesn't mean that clean air and clean water is not going to be the focus in the future. We're just going to do it right within the consistency of the framework that Congress has passed. Now, I think that's very important to recognize. ",2,870.0,155.0,guest,50.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
58,WALLACE," But, sir, you're giving me a regulatory answer, a political answer. You’re not giving me a health answer. I talked about 90,000 fewer asthma attacks, 300,000 fewer missed days in school and work.  The Obama Clean Power Plan called -- said that carbon pollution from the power sector would be reduced by 30 percent. It would be one-third lower than it was in 2005.  Here's what the American Lung Association says, ""Half of all Americans now live in counties with unhealthy air."" You talk about all the regulatory overreach, but the question is, there are 166 million people living in unclean air and you are going to remove some of the pollution restrictions, which will make the air even worse. ",2,696.0,124.0,host,51.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
59,PRUITT," Well, Chris, a couple things, we are actually pre-1994 levels with respect to our CO2 footprint. So, this country is doing far better than most across the globe. As you know, also since 1980, we've got a 65 percent reduction in those key air pollutants, SOx and NOx and particulate matter and ozone, while at the same time growing our economy.  I think what's happened the last several years is that we've adapted to and adopted this previous administration's views that if your pro-jobs and pro-growth, you can’t be pro-environment. If you’re pro-environment, you can’t be pro-growth and pro-jobs. And that simply is not the way we’ve done business as a country. ",2,665.0,115.0,guest,52.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
60,WALLACE," But, sir -- ",2,13.0,5.0,host,53.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02

62,,(CROSSTALK),2,,,,,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
63,WALLACE," If I may, you are talking about these reductions, but even with those reductions, the fact is that according to the American Lung Association, which would have an interest in this, 166 million people are living in unsafe air. And if you do away with the Clean Power Plan and boost -- as the president promises -- coal production, then you’re going to make the air even worse. What about those 166 million people?",2,413.0,75.0,host,55.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
64,PRUITT," Chris, I think what you are referring to is, we have about 40 percent of the country in non-attainment right now, those key air pollutants under our ambient air quality standards, which are outside of the CO2 discussion. And I agree wholeheartedly that we need to focus our attention at making sure we make progress there. In fact, that's one of the key priorities of the administration, is to improve air quality to be on the 60 percent attainment that we see.  That's not been a focal point over the last several years as much as it should be. So, I think -- ",2,562.0,106.0,guest,56.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
65,,(CROSSTALK),2,,,,,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
66,WALLACE," And you think -- and let me just ask, and you think that rewriting, in effect, doing away with the Clean Power Plan is going to improve air quality which you say is a major goal? ",2,180.0,38.0,host,57.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
67,PRUITT," Look -- look, Chris, I mean, I think what we have to keep in mind is that EPA only possesses authority that the Congress gets it. The EPA has tried twice to regulate CO2. One, with the tailoring rule, and the Supreme Court struck it down in the UR decision, and secondly, the Clean Power Plan that the president introduced in 2015, which is subject to a U.S. Supreme Court stay.  As much as we want to see progress made in clean air and clean water, with an understanding that we can also grow jobs, we had to do so within the framework of what Congress has passed. The tools have to be in a tool box.  The past administration just made it up. They re-imagined authority on a statute. There’s a commitment with the new administration to have a pro-growth, pro-environment approach to these issues, but also to respect rule of law.  You talked about many times, the regulatory overreach, about executive fiat that the previous administration engaged in. We can't continue that process because what happens, Chris, is clean air is not advanced because you have litigation such as the Clean Power Plan. You have stays of enforcement against that Clean Power Plan and there's no progress being made with clean air and we are also spending money on litigation. So -- ",2,1263.0,229.0,guest,58.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
68,,(CROSSTALK),2,,,,,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
69,WALLACE," That goes both ways, sir, because the fact is, you are already in litigation on the attempt to reverse the Clean Power Plan. You are already getting sued on that. So, there’s litigation either way.  Let me -- let me pursue this issue, because President Trump is going to sit down this week with Chinese President Xi. And for years, American presidents have been pushing Chinese leaders to improve greenhouse gas emissions, to reverse them. Are you comfortable seeing the roles were reversed this week where it will now be the Chinese president pushing President Trump to cut down on pollution? ",2,595.0,104.0,host,59.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
70,PRUITT," Look, I mean, Chris, it's quite -- when you look at what happened in Paris, at the Paris agreement and Paris accord, China and India weren't required to take any steps toward reduction of CO2 until the year 2030. That discussion, to think that China and India are more committed to the CO2 reduction in this country I think is quite -- quite false. ",2,350.0,66.0,guest,60.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02

73,PRUITT," As I indicated earlier, we are pre-1994 levels, and do you know why? Largely because of innovation and technology, hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, because there's been a conversion to natural gas in the generation of electricity. And what's important, Chris, in my view is that utility companies across this country that are generating electricity, you ought not have the regulator in Washington, D.C., in this instances the EPA picking winners and lawyers, saying to the American people that we’re going to be anti-coal, anti-fossil fuel as we generate electricity. That's bad for America.  Fuel diversity is very important. We have shown leadership. As I’ve indicated, we've made great progress with air quality since 1980. We made progress in the CO2 reduction side as well, at the same time, growing jobs. And so -- ",2,835.0,137.0,guest,62.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02

78,PRUITT," We have nothing to be apologetic about as with respect to leadership that we’ve shown as a country with respect to these key issues. And the president doesn't either. He shown great leadership and pro-growth, pro-jobs, and pro-environment, and we can do both. ",2,261.0,45.0,guest,66.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
79,WALLACE," Well, let me ask a specific question on that. You talk about the Paris Accords, which do call for reductions by China and other countries by 2030. And, in fact, China has already begun reducing its carbon emissions from coal power plants as you well. President Xi in January said that the Paris Climate Accord should remain enforced. As the chief environmental officer for the Trump administration, can you make the same commitment to the Paris climate accords? ",2,463.0,80.0,host,67.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
80,PRUITT," Engagement internationally is very important. To demonstrate the leadership that we have shown on this issue with China and India and other nations is very important. Those discussions should ensue.  But what Paris represents is bad deal for this country. We frontloaded our costs. China and India backloaded theirs. That caused a contraction in our economy.  Look, we've shown leadership on this issue in the key way, Chris, and we’re going to continue that. ",2,461.0,78.0,guest,68.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02

83,PRUITT," But is he more committed in action and deed? And the answer is no.  We've demonstrated through the steps we’ve taken already, the pre-1994 levels, because of that technology. We can burn coal in clean fashion. We shouldn't have this commitment by the U.S. government to say that fossil fuels are bad. Renewables are good.  The U.S. EPA and the U.S. government should not pick winners and losers, Chris. And that's what happened in the last several years. ",2,456.0,82.0,guest,70.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02

91,WALLACE," Mr. Pruitt, there are all kinds of studies that contradict you. The U.N.’s panel on climate change says it is at least 95 percent likely that more than half the temperature increase since the mid-20th century is due to human activities. NOAA, that’s our own, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says there's more carbon dioxide now than in the last 400,000 years, and NOAA says 2015 and 2016 are the two hottest years on record.  Mr. Pruitt, are we supposed to believe that that's all a coincidence? ",2,514.0,90.0,host,76.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
92,PRUITT," No, look, Chris, I said to the process -- in my confirmation process, individual senators as well, that there's a warming trend, the climate is changing. And human activity contributes to the change in some measure.  The real issue is how much we contribute to it and measuring that with precision. But then also, what is the process as far as response, what can we do about it, the tools in the toolbox to address the CO2 issue? And you can’t just simply, from the EPA perspective, make that up. You can't do with the president did previously with the Clean Power Plan, President Obama, and his administration, to simply re-imagine authority. That's why we have a U.S. Supreme Court stay against the Clean Power Plan. That's why President Trump is dealing with that regulatory overreach and charting a new path forward to deal with these issues within the framework of Clean Air Act. ",2,886.0,157.0,guest,77.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02

What if it is causing dramatic climate change and that we as humans through carbon emissions are contributing to it?  Simple question, what if you’re wrong? ",2,400.0,76.0,host,78.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
94,PRUITT," Look, let me say to you, CO2 contributes to greenhouse gas, it has a greenhouse gas effect and global warming, as methane does and other types of gases. The issue is, how much we contribute to it from the human activity perspective and what can be done about it from a process perspective, Chris.

96,PRUITT," I think that we've done it better than anybody in the world at burning coal clean, in a clean fashion. The innovative and technological advances that we've seen along with natural gas production and generating electricity, it all contributed to a CO2 footprint that’s pre-1994.  Again, we have done better than anybody in the world, and growing our economy and also being a good steward of our environment. We have nothing to be apologetic about. We’re going to operate within the framework of the Clean Air Act to deal with these issues and make sure that we advance clean air, clean water, not just with this respect to CO2, but with those key air pollutants under the ambient air quality standard program that we have.

Under the president's new budget, the EPA is cut 31 percent, that is more than any other agency.  And I want to put up some of the cuts that are included in the president's budget. Here are some of the 56 programs that would be scrapped: Great Lakes restoration, water runoff control for farmers, pesticide safety.

And I will tell you this, Chris, this attitude in Washington, D.C., that people in Texas and Oklahoma and Kansas and Colorado and the rest of the country don't care about the water they drink or the air they breathe and are not going to take care of the air and the water locally and states, I just don't believe that.

And it’s time now for our Sunday group. Laura Ingraham, editor of Lizette and a Fox News political analyst, Gerald Seib from The Wall Street Journal, Julie Pace, who covers the White House for the Associated Press, and former national security council staffer Gillian Turner. Well, Laura, the president and his team dug in deeper this week on this whole Russia scandal and their argument now is that the Obama administration surveilled the Trump team and then spread that classified information for political purposes. Is this helping or hurting the White House? ",4,794.0,129.0,host,93.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
116,"LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST"," Well, I think they know that as long as this investigation goes on, the harder it is for them to push on a number of fronts their domestic agenda, foreign policy, because I think a lot of folks do believe that the Russia focus is meant in part to delegitimize the presidency of Donald Trump. So when Sean Spicer makes that point, I think he's right, if -- if Grassley’s letter that he sent -- Charles Grassley sent a letter a few days ago --",4,442.0,86.0,guest,94.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02

118,INGRAHAM," Yes, Senator Grassley, who you don't want to tangle with. I mean when he -- when he -- he’s like a dog on a bone when he gets on an issue. He sent a letter to the FBI about Andrew McCabe, who’s the number two person at the FBI. Andrew McCabe’s wife received $700,000 in political contributions arranged and facilitated by none other than Clinton friend Terry McAuliffe. And his concern is that all documents that are -- be preserved, all communications better be turned over about what Andrew McCabe knew and when he knew it about the unmasking of individuals who were surveilled during the Trump transition, or during the Trump campaign. If it turns out, at the end of all of this, that the FBI and our intelligence agency have turned into partisan political operations with an agenda, then Republicans and Democrats should be very concerned. If it all turns out this is just a routine investigation, the Trump administration will have egg on its face. But I have a feeling that we’re going to find out a lot more about who was involved in the unmasking and who -- who had an agenda. ",4,1086.0,198.0,guest,96.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02

125,WALLACE," But as the week went on, it became clear that officials at the president's own National Security Council, inside the White House, were deeply involved in this, which raises the question, are to, are the president, and his team, and Devin Nunes all working together to protect Trump? ",4,284.0,50.0,host,101.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
126,"JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"," And I think it's important to note that even before Nunes came out and said he had received this new information, there were officials in the White House that were telling reporters, you should really be focused on the issue of improper unmasking. This is where we think the real story is. And then suddenly Devin Nunes shows up and says he's received information on exactly that topic.  Look, if there is on improper unmasking -- improper unmasking of Trump officials for political reasons --",4,494.0,87.0,guest,102.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
127,WALLACE," You -- unmasking means identification. Basically that there was -- there was surveillance of -- of people -- it may have not even been an American. It may have been foreigners. In fact, that’s what it’s thought, and they’re talking about Americans and they’re supposed to say American person one American person two. If it becomes clear American person one is Donald Trump, you're not supposed to say that. ",4,408.0,71.0,host,103.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
128,PACE," You’re not supposed to say that, though if you talk to intelligence professionals they say when you are talking about someone like the president, or the president’s national security advisor, their identity becomes almost impossible to reveal just based on the nature of the conversation. If there was improper handling of classified information, if it was spread improperly throughout the government, that’s a real concern. But the White House and Nunes aren't doing themselves any favors when they try to cover up how this information is getting into the House Intelligence chairman’s hands.",4,594.0,94.0,guest,104.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02

And -- and along those lines, I want to point out, here's what Mr. Flynn and Donald Trump said during the campaign about the fact that Clinton campaign officials got immunity in the e-mail investigation.

135,"GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," Yes. Which the whole situation, the whole scenario is highly unusual. But I would say this, that this story, especially with Nunes' involvement, it's like an onion where every day we’re peeling back more and more layers. And we could kind of go back and forth for infinity on who checked into the White House when and when they left and who talked to who. But at the core of the story remain two issues, two national security issues. One is the leaking of classified information to include the surveillance issue. The other is potential Russian attempted interference in the United States’ general election. Now, both of these issues are very more important than the politics surrounding them, by which I mean they both have implications for American national defense. And, by the way, they both spanned two presidential administrations at this point. People will push back and say, but there's no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign team and Russia in the -- in the general election. And that's fine and that's true. But I actually argue that that makes an investigation, a really thorough investigation about Russian efforts, more important because it means that whatever they were able to -- wherever they were able to get to, anything that achieved, they did on their own. Isn't that more compelling? ",4,1319.0,224.0,guest,109.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
136,WALLACE," Well, we don't know that. I mean that's one of the things and as -- as FBI Director Come said in the House hearing, he said that he -- they are currently investigating Russia and also the possibility of Trump campaign involvement.

137,"GERALD F. SEIB, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"," Well, never a scandal like this. I mean this is singular. I’ve never seen anything like this. I think what stands out is the fact that you have basic -- core intelligence issues being discussed so publicly and so openly either. I'm not sure that's in anybody's best interest. And I'm not sure it's in the White House interest to have it go on for infinity. I wonder if the White House wouldn’t be better served if the -- everybody could just turn down the volume and figure out how we’re going to get to the bottom of both of these questions, surveillance and Russian meddling.  And I think the one thing that happened this week was he got a glimpse that maybe there's one place where that can happen, and that's the Senate Intelligence Committee, where you had, you know, two senators, Senator Burr on the Republican side, and Senator Warner on the Democratic side --",4,869.0,159.0,guest,111.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02

And we’re back now with the panel. Well, Laura is our resident Supreme Court watcher and a former Supreme Court clerk under Clarence Thomas. And I'm not taking sides here, I’m just really asking, because it just gets worse and worse and worse, is there winning -- any way out for these just ever more partisan wars, and what do you think -- and I'm not saying this is the fault of one side or the other, about the fact that we’re -- it looks like this week we’re going to see a part of the institution of the Senate change and turning more into the House where it doesn't take a bipartisan majority of 60, 51 votes, a simple majority, can decide any nomination. ",5,853.0,158.0,host,119.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
149,INGRAHAM," Yes, well, I think McConnell was right in his point, this is a 200 year Senate tradition that will be forever changed. And Chuck Schumer, I mean, I hate to say this during a Sunday during Lent but, he's absolutely fraudulent in the way he characterizes this. There has never been a partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. When my former boss was confirmed, during all of the controversy surrounding Clarence Thomas, there wasn't a filibuster. He was confirmed. And it wasn't the largest of margins, but he was confirmed. The vote went forward and he -- you know, he ended up sitting on the Supreme Court, much to the consternation of the left. But -- but this is just -- this is -- this is ridiculous at this point.

McConnell -- I mean McConnell is -- he knows this stuff inside and out and he’s completely right the way he characterizes it.  Now, I understand that the Democrats don't want Neil Gorsuch to be on the court. I got that. But he's going to be on the court. This, in the end, hurts Chuck Schumer, this hurts the Democrats because if -- if you get rid of, you know, this rule -- this -- this rule, now you will only be able to have 52 justices to -- to confirm the next nominee. That could be --",5,635.0,126.0,guest,122.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02

154,WALLACE," Well, that's what I want to pick up on with you, Gerry. As -- as explosive as this is, this is a conservative judge, Scalia, being replaced by another conservative judge, Gorsuch. There is a lot of talk, and it’s speculation, who knows, in June that Anthony Kennedy, the key swing vote in the Senate, might retire. And at that point Trump is -- is naming somebody who can shift the balance of the court for three decades. ",5,423.0,80.0,host,125.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
155,SEIB," Right, and that's the argument that some Democrats even are using for not invoking -- letting the nuclear option be invoked this time. This is not an appointment that changes the ideological balance of the court. This preserves it. It’s a status quo shift. The next one probably won't be, or may not be. So maybe you ought to preserve your firepower until then.  I think the problem right now is there -- my colleague, Jess Bravin, wrote a good piece this week saying there are dueling narratives here. The Democratic narrative is, this is a stolen Supreme Court seat. This belonged to Merrick Garland. It was supposed to be filled by President Obama. Republicans stopped it. Republicans say there was a national referendum on who should be on the Supreme Court. It was called the presidential election. We won. This is basically a mandate. Those two can’t be reconciled.",5,872.0,152.0,guest,126.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
156,WALLACE," No, that's right, and as -- as I say, there are no clean hands in this, and there’s perfect hypocrisy.  Let's turn to the Trump agenda in the wake of the health care defeat. And the first big issue, which I talked about with Senator McConnell, which is the real possibility of a government shutdown on April 28th.  Julie, the president has been attacking members of the House Freedom Caucus this week, at least they’re talking about reaching out to Senate Democrats and House Democrats.

159,PACE," Moving on. No, look, I mean they -- they talk about a government shutdown and feeling confident that they are going to be able to -- to avoid that. They talk about reaching out to Democrats. They talk about trying to put pressure on the House Freedom Caucus, but it's largely just talk at this point. And when you -- when you look at the Democrats, there is almost no indication that Democrats are ready to start working with this administration on even something like an infrastructure package, which in theory should have some bipartisan support.  And when it comes to the House Freedom Caucus, you -- you see these guys responding to these tweets from Trump. They are not feeling the pressure. They are not backing away. And this has always been a relationship that has been a little odd between Trump and the Freedom Caucus because they may all be outsiders, they may all want to shake up Washington, but the Freedom Caucus guys come in with a really clear ideology.

160,WALLACE," Quick -- quick, specific question that I also asked McConnell.

",5,245.0,45.0,host,131.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-04-02
161,PACE," That is a great question. And that, I think, could be -- could be a real pressure point here.

But what’s clear to people like me, who sit somewhere in between, is that this has now become a very real divide. Maybe entrenched in the wake of the collapse of the health care bill.

The result: a damaging defeat for Donald Trump, a consummate dealmaker, in the first big negotiation of his presidency. In a moment, we’ll drill down into what went wrong and what it means to the rest of the president's agenda with White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, and Congressman Jim Jordan, and leader of the House Freedom Caucus.

9,"KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT"," Chris, it certainly makes sense for the White House to move on to what could best be described as political low-hanging fruit -- jobs, regulatory reform. And we certainly expect to her great deal more about those issues this week as the White House tries to reassure the president’s rattled base following Friday’s setback on health care. In fact, the president seemed to look forward in a tweet he had just yesterday talking about ObamaCare as you said, saying that it would ultimately explode and that he would eventually get together with just his party and perhaps even others who might want to be involved in all that and try to come up with a plan to repeal and replace for the people. He said, ""Do not worry,"" and that was the message taken to West Virginia by his Vice President Mike Pence. He met, of course, with business leaders on Saturday and he said the fight to repeal and replace is not over yet.",1,913.0,166.0,guest,8.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-26

The U.S. corporate tax rate among the highest in the world, the president has said he’d like to cut the corporate rate down to 15 percent from 35 percent and he's repeatedly promised to reduce the tax burden on the American families. But, Chris, it’s also important to point out that there is some concern among GOP lawmakers that given Friday’s fiasco on ObamaCare, the road ahead on tax reform could ultimately be even more complicated, especially when you consider the incredible number of competing stakeholders that can make what happened last week look like child's play moving forward -- Chris.",1,770.0,131.0,guest,10.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-26

21,PRIEBUS," Well, I mean, look, ObamaCare as we know is imploding and it is exploding, and every other adjective you can provide. It's going south. And it would be nice to get the Democrats on board. But you’re right, at the end of the day, I believe that it's time for the party to start governing. And I think that's important. I think that Democrats can come to the table as well and if you look at what the president said in the Oval just after that comment, he said, you know, ""Perhaps it's time for us to start talking to some moderate Democrats as well and come up with, you know, a bipartisan solution."" I do think that there are Republicans this weekend, Chris, that are scrambling. I think there are people in the Freedom Caucus, in the Tuesday Group, and for those listeners, that's the moderate group that are starting to talk about what the next steps are in order to prevent an implosion of ObamaCare. But the president has also said that when ObamaCare does ultimately explode, which it will, we are going to be prepared to lead again and if Democrats come on board with a plan down the road, we will welcome that.",1,1118.0,208.0,guest,16.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-26

26,PRIEBUS," Well, I think the president is 100 percent correct and he hits the bull's eye in that tweet, like he often does. We can’t be chasing the perfect all the time. I mean, sometimes you have to take the good and put it in your pocket and take the win. And we only have -- we have a two-party system in this country. You know, we’re not Italy. We don't have 12 different parties where you have the super conservatives, the kind of conservatives, the moderates, and everyone else in between and everyone fits nicely into one package. We have one party, Republican Party, and one Democrat Party. And Republican Party came up with a package the president met with over 120 members of the House. There was more love shown to outside groups by this White House, whether it's Vice President Pence, Mick Mulvaney, Tom Price, Steve Bannon, myself, Mark Short. I mean, the point is, the diverse group of people working the halls of Congress, including the leadership in Congress, I think it's time for our folks to come together, and I also think it's time to potentially get a few moderate Democrats on board as well.",1,1104.0,200.0,guest,20.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-26

38,PRIEBUS," And it's a possibility, Chris. I don't think the president is closing the door on anything in regard to the issue of health care. But if you look at this bill, and you look at what it provided, I mean, the tax relief, the largest entitlement reform in modern history. You look at the fact that we were almost to the point where we would be defunding Planned Parenthood, or we were to the point where we were defunding Planned Parenthood. The fact that some of these members took that and decided not to move forward with it I think is a real shame and I think the president is disappointed in the number of people that he thought were loyal to him that weren’t. That all being said, I want people out there to understand that this president is not going to be a partisan president. This is a president that wants to provide, and you are right, he wants to make sure that people don't get left behind. He wants to make sure that there’s competition in the marketplace so that rates are lower and people can choose their doctor. So, if those three things are incompatible with some members of the Republican House, then it's going to be incompatible, and then we need to work with moderate Democrats to make sure that that happens. We will leave no one behind, we want to make sure that people are covered, they pick their doctor and they pay less and we enforce competition in the market.",1,1388.0,258.0,guest,29.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-26

41,WALLACE," I want to get to that, because this is like the third time in our brief conversation that you’ve talked about reaching out to Democrats. Is the lesson president is taking away from this defeat that he's got to change his legislative strategy, that you don't have a governing majority in the House that the Freedom Caucus never seems to get to yes, and that he's got to be more of a bipartisan president and reach out to Democrats and try to pick up some votes because he can't count on Republicans to give you the majority?",1,524.0,98.0,host,31.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-26
42,PRIEBUS," Well, I don't know if he agrees with everything you just said, but what I do think is that everything is on the table. We’ll give these guys another chance. And it’s not -- that's not really the point. If we can come up with a bill that accomplishes the goals of the president with Republicans alone, then we’ll take it and we’ll move forward with it. But we're moving on the tax reform. We’ve got the budget coming up. I think it's more or less a warning shot that we are willing to talk to anyone, we always have been, and I think more so now than ever, it's time for both parties to come together and get to real reforms in this country whether it be taxes, whether it’d be health care, whether it’d be immigration, whether it’d be infrastructure, this president is ready to lead and sort of -- you know, over with the games in the legislature.",1,848.0,162.0,guest,32.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-26

That's even more complicated that health care reform because it involves every industry and not just one industry, and you’ve also got a big split within the Republican Party because Speaker Ryan wants this border adjustment tax which would tax imports, not exports, and there are a lot of Republicans who say no way.

I’ve been on your show before and I’ve had people in my office, at the highest levels of the intelligence community that volunteered, I didn't do anything wrong, they came into my office, shut my door and told me that these stories about Russian contacts and collusion were ridiculous. So, there are leaks out there that are injuring the president, it's wrong, and people should be prosecuted. Now, as to whether or not to the first party of your question that there some sort of broad conspiracy, there's potentially something very wrong here.

Let's do the responsible thing. Let’ get back to work and do what we told the voters we were going to do. Remember this bill, 17 percent of the country approved this bill. Maybe the fact that we opposed it, we did the country a favor because this bill didn't repeal ObamaCare. This bill didn't do what we told the American people we were going to do.

You saw conservatives and frankly moderates in the House and Senate oppose this legislation. So, it didn't unite our party. So, why didn't we just do -- there’s been talk about moving the goalpost moves? You know when the goalposts were moved, when they didn't start with the legislation we all voted for 15 months ago, the same bill I introduced two weeks ago, which said, let’s do clean repeal in one piece of legislation, and then let’s do a separate piece of legislation to replace ObamaCare with patient-centered healthcare.",2,668.0,114.0,guest,115.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-26

157,JORDAN," There’s nothing that said you couldn’t start with our clean repeal bill and also put in some other things that would help. But the focus is, we want to bring back affordable insurance. The left always defines success by signing people up for ObamaCare, signing people up for Medicaid. Conservatives say, no, no, a better approach is to get back to market-oriented health care. Let’s bring down the cost of premiums so that middle-class people will be able to afford a plan in the private sector that actually fits their families needs, not a one-size-fits-all mandate from Washington.

What went wrong? What should President Trump and his team do differently next time? And what about Speaker Paul Ryan?",4,303.0,52.0,host,165.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-26
204,"NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," Well, look, Ryan’s a brilliant policy guy. This is his first really big effort to put together a legislative package. I hope that this will be a moment in the Trump presidency when they realize that they can’t win an inside game. Trump's great strength is in the country, as Reagan’s great strength was in the country. It took Reagan until August to pass a tax cut, which is a pretty easy thing. It took us until August of ’96 to pass welfare reform, which is a relatively easy thing. First ground rule is simple, don’t set up an artificial deadline to fail. The second ground rule is equally simple, start with the country understanding what you’re doing and then try to do it in Washington. But they’re here with a -- with a fake score from CBO and the absurdity of the Senate reconciliation bills, trying to explain a process that is hopelessly complicated to the average American and then saying in the age of Donald Trump, trust us, we’re going to fix it all in the second and third phases. It was just profoundly miss-designed.",4,1034.0,188.0,guest,166.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-26

206,GINGRICH," No, I think -- I think it was -- I think the congressional leadership still wants to behave as though -- though they’re in a pre-Trump world, and I think Trump, frankly, trusted them and up until, what, five days out, they kept telling him they had the votes.",4,260.0,50.0,guest,168.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-26

208,KRISTOL," They’ll have to revisit reforming and repealing parts, at least, of ObamaCare over the next year and a half. There's plenty of time, as Newt said. I do think just going for some huge comprehensive bill on the toughest thing to tackle, something that the Clinton administration didn’t succeed with in ’93-’94, they never got even a vote on their health care bill, and that Barack Obama took 15 months of arm twisting with bigger majorities to get through, to begin with that was a little crazy. There’s a lot of low-hanging fruit he could do. Some of it bipartisan. I thought Reince Priebus was interesting in his talk with you. They could do some stuff some conservatives won't like and get Democrats on board of, bringing some prescription drug prices down. If I were Trump now, I would do some easy things. There’s a continue resolution in a month. Say, I want the wall funded now, in 2017, not 2018. I’m not a big fan of the wall, but if you’re a Trump voter, you like the wall, right? I want the defense supplement now. I’m building back the military. He has three or four things he could do over the next month.

215,"CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST"," Well, on the second part of your question, obviously it's increasing the demand for an independent investigation, both in the media and elsewhere on Capitol Hill, if I’m not mistaken I think John McCain piped up about that again this week. And for good reason that here you have a House body, obviously whose chairman feels it's his duty, you know, the minute some new development takes place in the middle of their investigation, to run over to the target in effect of the investigation and tell him what's going on. On the point about whether or not it's a mistake, I guess it depends on what his goal was. If his goal was to remain in good graces with the Trump administration, it was probably a very successful venture on his part, but it doesn't seem to me, at least, consistent with sort of separation of powers 101.

12,RYAN,"  That is our plan.  I think Thursday is most likely going to be our day to bring it forward.  We bring it to the rules committee first.  So, part of our regular order process is to go through four committees.  We’re now going to go to the rules committee.  And so, we feel very good where we are.   We're still having conversations with our members.  We are making fine-tuning improvements to the bill to reflect people's concerns, to reflect people's improvements.  The president, you say people being seated at the table, the president is bringing people to his table and I’m very impressed with how the president is helping us close this bill, and making the improvements that we've been making, getting the votes.   And so, we feel very good where we are.  We like the process because it's the regular order process.  We're going to make those changes at the rules committee that the budget committee and others have asked for.  And so, we feel like we're on track and we are doing -- we are right where we want to be.  ",1,1025.0,187.0,guest,11.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19

14,RYAN,"  Yes, I feel very good about actually.  I feel like it's exactly where we want to be.  The reason I feel so good about this is because the president has become a great closer.  He's the one who was helped negotiate changes to this bill with members from all over our caucus.  I call it getting the sweet spot, you’ve got to get 218 Republicans, who come from all different walks of life, to come together to agree on the best possible plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare.   And the reason I feel very good where we are, we all, all of us, all Republicans in the House, Senate, and the president, made a promise to the American people that we would repeal and replace this faulty collapsing law, and we’re going to make good on that promise.  ",1,744.0,141.0,guest,13.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19
15,WALLACE,"  You talk about changes.  You’re going to offer what is known up on the Hill as a ""manager's amendment"" to reflect the changes you’re going to make to try to pick up the final votes you need.  And I want to go through some of the items that are being discussed about that. Allow states to impose a work requirement for able-bodied Medicaid recipients.  Allow states to accept a fixed block grant for Medicaid, and boost the tax credits for lower income and older people.   Mr. Speaker, will all of those items be in the manager's amendment?  ",1,543.0,100.0,host,14.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19
16,RYAN,"  Yes, those are all things that we are working on and the manager's amendment.  We're making sure that we get all the language right.  As you know, we have this weird thing called the Byrd rule, which is reconciliation.  So, we’re making sure that these changes that were being discussed conform with this.   And so, we've gotten lots of feedback from conservatives, from governors, from people in all walks of life in our conference, from different perspectives about changes they think to improve this bill.  We are working on the kinds of changes you just described and we're going through that process and we’re going to bring those changes to the rules committee.  ",1,671.0,116.0,guest,15.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19

22,RYAN,"  No.  You are misinterpreting me.  The binary choice is when we bring this to a vote, that's when it becomes a binary choice.  Until we bring the bill to the floor, we are always making improvements.   There is one more to describe what's going on, legislating.  We are not actually doing this behind the scenes and just bringing some bill to the floor and making people vote for it.  We’re listening to people and the president is right.  He is the one, it’s -- we’ve never had this before, that’s why I’m very excited.   We have a president who is rolling up his sleeves, he’s learning -- he’s a very quick learner on health care.  He’s a business guy who came to the presidency, and now, he's helping us make sure that would bridge differences with members who are bringing constructive ideas and solutions for how to make this bill better.  Four-committee process, we’ve got the fourth committee coming up, that's always been the plan, to always learn, listen, negotiate and improve the bill, make the fine-tuning, and then bring the bill to the floor, and that is where it then becomes a binary choice.   That's what I meant all along what I said this, which is, when we bring this to a vote, either we’re going to keep the ObamaCare status quo, the law is collapsing, five states have one plan left, over a third of the counties in America have only one insurer left.  Some are already pulling out, massive premium increases in the future, a collapsing law.  Or, we replace it with patient-centered health care that works where we give people more freedom, where we let the states go back to running their health insurance markets.   That is what we ran on.  This is the plan we ran on all of last year.  And we've been working with administration hand in glove and the Senate since January to put this together, and when this vote comes up, that's when it will be a binary choice, either for the status quo or for repealing and replacing this law.  ",1,1957.0,356.0,guest,19.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19
23,WALLACE,"  Mr. Speaker, as a governing principle, do you believe that every American should be able to get health care insurance if they wanted?  ",1,137.0,25.0,host,20.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19
24,RYAN,"  Yes, I do believe this is a critical need for Americans.  I do believe that we can have in this country a health care system for everyone can get access to affordable health care coverage, including people with pre-existing conditions.  I believe that that is achievable.  I believe that that is what we are achieving in this legislation. And the answer is not a government one-size-fits-all, arrogant micromanaging system where the government forces you to buy something you don't want, don't need, or can't afford.   The goal here is to get every American access to affordable coverage.  That means we have to bring the cost of health care down.  That means we don't want monopolies.  ",1,689.0,118.0,guest,21.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19

27,WALLACE,"  Let me pick up on this, because the Congressional Budget Office, I don't have to tell you, came out this week with a pretty dramatic forecast and they said that 24 million fewer Americans will have health insurance in ten years under your plan.  You said that part of that is that this is what freedom looks like.   Here you are.  ",1,333.0,64.0,host,24.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19

31,WALLACE,"  But, sir, is the major decrease in the number of people, according to the CBO, who will have health insurance, is it freedom or is it that some people will no longer be able to afford health insurance under your plan?   I want to show a specific case that the CBO put up.  Look at these numbers.  In ten years, the CBO said a 64-year-old with an income of $26,500 will pay $1,700 out-of-pocket under ObamaCare for health insurance.  Under your plan, the CBO says that same person will have to pay $14,600 because insurance companies can charge more and the tax credit that you’re going to offer is smaller than the subsidy that ObamaCare will offer.   So, what they are saying is that this isn't freedom.  This isn't people voluntarily deciding not to have health insurance.  It’s that your plan makes it unaffordable for people.  ",1,833.0,150.0,host,26.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19
32,RYAN,"  So, there are three things I would say.   Number one, what they basically say is people -- ObamaCare is not going to last.  There's no way ObamaCare could stick another two or three years, let alone ten years.  And so, they are comparing in ObamaCare plan that’s mythical, that won't exist in ten years.   And then they’re saying, well, if people are buying what ObamaCare is going to make them buy, then they will be able to afford it.   Here's the point: we believe that we do need to add some additional assistance with people in those older cohorts.  But the apples to oranges comparison that’s happening here is, we’re not going to make people buy something that’s so expensive that they can't afford, that the market is not going to offer.   And so, where I dispute that comparison is it suggests that we’re going to have the same kind of plans being offered in ten years that ObamaCare would otherwise offer.  It won’t be it is collapsing.",1,948.0,173.0,guest,27.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19

40,RYAN,"  Let me just say, the older, the person in their 50s and 60s -- the person in the 50s and 60s does have additional health care cost than a person in the 20s and 30s, the tax credit adjust for that.  But you’re right in saying, and we agree, we believe we should have even more assistance.  And that's one of the things we’re looking at for that person in the 50s and 60s because they experience higher health care costs.   So, the critical difference here is we’re going to --",1,477.0,93.0,guest,32.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19

43,RYAN,"  That is among the things we're looking at doing, yes.  And the point I would say is, we’re going to let people buy what they want to buy.  We’re going to have more plans being offered, more choice and competition, and this is before Tom Price does anything to deregulate the marketplace, to bring more competition and lower prices which the CBO could not and did not analyze.   So, the CBO looked at a little piece of the issue when we know that the secretary of HHS will help bring market freedom and regulatory relief to the health insurance markets to dramatically lower the price of plans for those 50 and 60-year-olds.  But even with that, we think that we should be offering even more assistance than what the bill currently does.",1,738.0,134.0,guest,34.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19

52,WALLACE,"  And what he basically means by that is they’re going to be big defense increases, spending increases, and they’re going to be offsetting and sizable decreases in a lot of domestic discretionary programs.  Are you comfortable -- and I want to talk about two in specifics, because what really gets down to is not big numbers, but specific programs.  Are you comfortable with cutting the National Institutes of Health by 20 percent?  Are you comfortable with cutting funding for Meals on Wheels, which supplies food to two -- and seniors depend on it -- to 2.5 million elderly Americans?  ",1,588.0,101.0,host,41.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19
53,RYAN,"  Well, I would say, this is the very, very beginning of the budget process, a process I have worked with for many years.  They submitted their budget.  They will go through the congressional system.   What typically happens as a president submits their budget and then Congress takes it from there and makes necessary changes to that budget going forward. We are encouraged that we seeing an increasing in defense because we think our military has been hollowed out.   But I will say that NIH is something that’s particularly popular in Congress.  We just passed the Cures Act just this last December to increase spending in the NIH, we really think we're kind of getting close to some breakthrough discoveries on cancer and other diseases.  So, that is something that I think and Congress you’ll see probably some changes.   But with respect to any one of these types of programs, this is the beginning of a very long multi-stage process of budgeting and I do believe at the end of the day, we’re going to honor these priorities, in particular our defense spending priorities.  And so, I’m glad that the administration got going.  I want financial pressure, I want spending caps, because that makes us focus on cutting spending that is wasteful spending.   There are a lot of programs that are duplicative, that are wasteful, that aren't measuring up to the goals that they are supposed to achieve.  And you want that kind of fiscal pressure, so you go after waste, you go after fraud, you go after abuse and you move money from programs that aren’t succeeding or working or achieving the goals to those that do, while we honor our priorities.   So, this is just the beginning of that long process, and I’m encouraged that we are up and starting with it.  That’s what I’m really mostly encouraged about is the White House gave us numbers so we can get started, that's what encourages me.  ",1,1891.0,333.0,guest,42.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19

That investigation is ongoing, it's not complete.  Let's see this investigation run its course.  We have not seen evidence that you just described.  I think you will probably get that same kind of answer from Chairman Nunes in a few minutes.  ",1,688.0,121.0,guest,44.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19

67,"KARL ROVE, GOP STRATEGIST","  Well, it is a damaging number, but when you look under the surface of it, it starts with 14 million fewer people in the next years not having insurance who would otherwise have it.  Virtually, all of those, the CBO says, are as a result of the end of the mandate.  That is to say, the penalties that are inflicted upon people who don't buy insurance.  And if they are not inflicted with a penalty, then they’re not going to buy insurance.   So, the Republicans have got a different approach, which is, let's provide fair track tax treatment in the form of an advancable, refundable tax credit to the people who are self-employed, who don’t get that kind of treatment, because they don't get their insurance from their employer, and the people and small businesses that don't get coverage.  And the CBO has historically underestimated the effect of market choices like that, as it did in the Medicare Part D, and overestimated the impact of what a government mandate penalty would do.",2,985.0,174.0,guest,53.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19

70,ROVE,"  Yes.  I think, look, actually, I think that they started to come -- they wanted some things.  They couldn't figure out what those things were, but they stumbled into a couple of them, and they are happy. I think the biggest one is, is that poor people who are on Medicaid who are able-bodied without children that states ought to be able to impose a work requirement that says if you want this government benefit, much like we did with welfare, you got to be looking for work or working in order to get the benefit.  And I think that’s made a lot of conservatives more comfortable.",2,583.0,108.0,guest,55.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19

124,ROVE,"  I love the newfound concern for younger people.  To say all these older people are going to have the premiums go up.  Well, their premiums are going up because ObamaCare makes younger, healthier workers subsidized older, less healthy workers, and then why are we surprised that ObamaCare is not getting the percentage of younger, healthier workers to make the system work?   Now, what is the answer to ObamaCare?  One of its leading architects has three suggested answers: increased payments to insurance companies so they can hide the premium increases, increased penalties on those without insurance, penalize people even more, and increased subsidies for those in the exchanges.   Now, I think Dr. Emanuel was pretty serious in these, but none of these is doing anything except throwing more money at a system that’s broken.  ",2,831.0,137.0,guest,100.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19

157,NUNES," Well, if he's talking about the unmasking of names, and so if there were other surveillance activities where names were picked up and then unmasking occurred, and that was spread throughout the intelligence community, that is very -- that is very possible, and we don't have the answers to those questions yet. I don't know if the president has those are not. But we had a deadline of Friday for the NSA, FBI and CIA to get us those names that were unmasked through the FISA system. We didn't get those names on Friday. So until we get those names, we can't rule this out.",4,573.0,106.0,guest,124.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19

159,NUNES," Well, we’re excited about this because for the first time the American people, and all the political parties now, are paying attention to the threat that Russia poses. So we’re going to highlight that. We’ll highlight the fact that we know that the Russians were trying to get involved in our campaign, like they have for many decades. They're also trying to get involved in campaigns around the globe and -- over in Europe. So I think it will be good to highlight that. Secondly, we’re worried about analytical integrity. We don't know how there were information changed and if information changed because in December, the beginning of December, the assessment was that, hey, the Russians were trying to go -- get into our election process and cause problems and sew doubt in our -- in our system. But then that changed a month later and they it said, no, no, no, that they were trying to help Donald Trump. So we need to get to the bottom of that.

161,NUNES," Well, you’re -- you’re right to point that out, because the one crime we know that’s been committed is that one, the leaking of someone's name through the FISA system. That is -- that is a crime that’s been committed. We don't know the answer to that. That's what we're trying to get to the bottom of.

When you consider -- when you look at what happened to General Flynn, it's very, very concerning. This is -- this is someone, you know, look, the president had the right to get rid of him. He’s going -- he’s not in the administration any longer, but he is -- was an American citizen. He was talking to the Russian ambassador. Talking to diplomats in this town, as you know, Chris, is something that happens -- occurs on a -- on a regular basis. I probably talk to a dozen -- a dozen diplomats a week.

190,WALLACE," But, while Tillerson is in China, and here’s a picture of it, North Korea has just tested a new rocket engine. A couple of questions, how urgent is the threat that North Korea is going to be able to put a nuclear warhead on an ICBM missile that could hit the U.S., and should we seriously consider the military option, whether it's a strike by the U.S. or getting North -- South Korea and Japan to boost their military capabilities?",4,433.0,81.0,host,155.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-19

We hope that we -- it doesn't come to that. But this is -- this is an unhinged regime. You have 20 million people, you know, living in extreme poverty. And so I -- I'm actually very impressed. I've never met the -- the new secretary of state yet, but I am -- I am happy that we’re getting off of this strategic patience, which was our last policy towards North Korea.

NATO, for a long time, has been a strong ally of ours, but -- but they’re becoming more and more worrisome in terms of actually being a reliable ally. And, you know, I don't know that we would extradite somebody like that. I haven't seen the evidence for that, that Gulen was involved in anything like that. If he was, I mean clearly that would be a different -- a different issue.

We’re in the 16th week of the Democrats making the claims of collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign brought about Hillary Clinton’s defeat. I say a pox on all their houses. Let’s stop it. It’s in the hands of a couple of adults. You had one of them on, Devin Nunes. I was surprised, Adam Schiff, who has a reputation for sometimes being an overt partisan, he handled it in an adult way last week. Senator Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the ranking Democrat Senator Warner are appearing to approach this in a -- in a thoughtful fashion. I -- I would hope the American people would leave it in their hands to -- to wrap this all up.

9,WALLACE,"  And hello again from Fox News in Washington.   Just over halfway through its first 100 days, President Trump faces a showdown over a key legislative initiative.  The house Republican plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare is encountering stiff opposition from the right wing of the party.   In a few minutes, we’ll talk with one of those opponents, Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio, founding member of the House Freedom Caucus.   But, first, the director of the White House National Economic Council and one of the president's top advisors, Gary Cohn, in his first Sunday interview.   Gary, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office will report this week, perhaps as early as tomorrow on its assessment of the repeal and replace plan, and there are other groups that are estimating that the CBO will say that between 6 million and 15 million people will lose coverage under the ObamaCare repeal and replace plan.   Will the president support a bill that throws a -- millions of Americans off insurance?  ",1,1004.0,171.0,host,8.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
10,"GARY COHN, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR","  Well, Chris, you have to remember where we are.  We came into office with an insurance plan that doesn't work.  ObamaCare just is not working.  You know, in the last year alone, premiums are up 25 percent.  In the third of the counties in this country, we have only one insurance provider.  Therefore, American citizens don't have a choice.   We have no choice but to make the plan better for all Americans out there.  We will get a score next week.  CBO will do what they need to do, we will see what the score is.  In fact, in the past, the CBO score has really been meaningless.  They’ve said that many more people will be insured that are actually insured.  But, look, when we get the CBO score, we’ll deal with that.  ",1,725.0,136.0,guest,9.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
11,WALLACE,"  But I -- to repeat my question, will the president support a plan, if the CBO says that millions of people will lose their health insurance coverage, will the president continue to support that plan?  ",1,203.0,37.0,host,10.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
12,COHN,"  But, Chris, it's not just about coverage, it's about access to care.  It’s about access to be able to see you doctors.  The numbers of who's covered and who is not covered, that's interesting, and I know that may make some headlines, but what we care about is people’s ability to get health care and people’s ability to go see their doctor.  That's what we care about and that's what we’re driving for.  ",1,406.0,75.0,guest,11.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

20,COHN,"  Well, Chris, we are offering coverage to everyone.  If you are on Medicaid today, you’re going to stay on Medicaid.  If you are covered under an employee-sponsored plan, you’re going to be continued to be covered under an employee-sponsored plan.  If you fall into that middle group, we’re going to provide tax credit so you can go out and buy a plan.  And buy a plan that you want, not a plan that Washington is determining that you should buy.  ",1,449.0,82.0,guest,17.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
21,WALLACE,"  But I guess the question is this: 20 million people gained coverage, have health insurance coverage now who didn't have it before ObamaCare.  Are some of them going to lose coverage because, one, you’re going to end over a period of years, the Medicaid expansion, and, two, the tax credits are not going to provide as much help as the subsidies did to help people who can't afford coverage?",1,392.0,70.0,host,18.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
22,COHN,"  Chris, we don't think so.  If you’re on Medicaid, you’re going to stay on Medicaid.  ",1,87.0,17.0,guest,19.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
23,WALLACE,  But not the expanded Medicaid.  ,1,34.0,7.0,host,20.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
24,COHN,"  If you’re on Medicaid, you’re going to stay.  The expansion is not going to change.  There's a roll off period, there’s a period of transition and we’re very confident that the period of transition is going to work. If you’re going to the exchanges today, and you -- we’re going to give you tax credits, going to allow you to buy insurance with tax credits and if you are more than half of the Americans today, 175 million plus Americans are getting there health insurance through employee-sponsored coverage plans.  So, we believe, if you want to have coverage and we think that everyone should have coverage, we’re providing you access to coverage.  ",1,654.0,114.0,guest,21.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
25,WALLACE,"  The most conservative House Republicans are demanding a couple of changes to the plan that you guys are now supporting.  And I want to ask you about those.   First, end the expansion of Medicaid next year, not in 2020, and, two, end insurance mandates that require plans cover some benefits, a wide range of benefits including maternity care.   Will the president negotiate with the hardline conservatives or will he stand by the so-called Ryan bill, the repeal and replace build that is now before Congress as Sean Spicer said he would on Friday?  ",1,551.0,97.0,host,22.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
26,COHN,"  Chris, I think the president has been very open and transparent on the issue that he's been willing to accept improvements to the bill.  We’ve got out of our way and the president has said this, to say that anything that makes the bill better for Americans, we are willing to accept.   We've met with many groups over the last week, week and a half.  We’ve talked with many different groups as we possibly could.  And anyone that comes off with an improvement, we are more than happy to accept.   In fact, the president wants to implement many of these improvements.  He's very concerned that we have as many products out there as we can for consumers.  He wants to have the ability to -- for insurance companies to sell across state lines.  In fact, he is insisting that insurance companies have the ability to sell across state lines.  ",1,840.0,153.0,guest,23.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

36,COHN,"  Chris, look, the economy continues to grow and we’re doing our part.  We are doing more than our part to have the economy grow.   I’m sure you've noticed all of the CEOs that have been into the White House recently and all the announcements that these CEOs have made, including last week, when Exxon was in and talk about a multiple billions, tens of billions of dollar investment in the Gulf of Mexico where they’re going to create 45,000 new jobs.  We’ve had many other CEO announcements in the White House, and all of them have said to the president, when they talked to the president, we are creating these jobs because you, Mr. President, and your policies.   These jobs have not had the job market yet.  These are jobs that will be coming over the remainder of this year and next year.  So, we’re very, very excited about the job outlook in this country.  ",1,864.0,159.0,guest,31.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
37,WALLACE,"  Well, let me ask about something that perhaps you’re not so excited about.  The Federal Reserve is almost certain to raise interest rates when they meet this week.  Are you worried -- excuse me -- are you worried that if there is a series of rate hikes over this year and early next year, that that could hinder economic growth?  ",1,332.0,62.0,host,32.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
38,COHN,"  Look, Chris, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency and they operate as such.  They have their economic data, which they look at, and they are trying to always modulate, you know, economic growth with inflation, with the workforce.  I think the Federal Reserve has been doing a good job in doing that.  The Fed will do what they need to do, and we respect the powers of the Fed.   We -- it's our job at the White House, and the president’s job, and he is pushing us every day to continue to grow the economy, to create jobs and encourage manufacturing jobs and all jobs here in the United States, and to remove any and all barriers to job creation.  ",1,658.0,124.0,guest,33.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
39,WALLACE,"  Let’s turn to another subject, and that’s the budget that the administration will release this week.  Here are some key outlines we know about the budget.  $54 billion increase in defense spending, to be offset by equal cuts in domestic spending.   And here are some of the reductions that the White House is considering.  A 24 percent cut in the Environmental Protection Agency, and 11 percent cut for TSA, including airport security, a 37 percent cut for the State Department on foreign aid.   Question, Gary, is that the Trump vision for the country?  ",1,557.0,97.0,host,34.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
40,COHN,"  Chris, President Trump ran on a platform of protecting America, building our military and creating military superiority.  Over the last two or three weeks, President Trump has had in all of the generals of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, and he -- they have talked to him about our preparedness and our readiness.   And it's disappointing to hear what these general say we are.  We have under invested in our military over the last eight years.  Our military budget has been subject to sequester.  We have been unable to invest in our military. Unfortunately, we have no alternative but to reinvest in our military and make ourselves a military power once again.  If you’re doing that in an area where you have to balance the budget and you cannot create a further deficit, you have to make cuts.  It's no different than every other family in America that has to make the tough decisions when they need to spend money somewhere, they have to cut it from somewhere else.   These are tough decisions, but the president has shown he is ready, willing, and able to make these tough decisions.  ",1,1108.0,197.0,guest,35.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

53,WALLACE,"  By the end of this month, Republican leaders want to bring their bill to the House floor to repeal and replace ObamaCare.  But the Trump administration is struggling to win over some conservative members who call the plan ObamaCare-light.   Joining me now from Ohio, Congressman Jim Jordan, a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, some 40 conservative lawmakers who could be the biggest obstacle to passing the legislation.   Congressman, you called for using the budget reconciliation plan to pass a clean repeal of ObamaCare.  ",2,538.0,89.0,host,47.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

55,WALLACE,"  The problem is, then you’re going to need 60 votes to do a lot of things that the ObamaCare repeal and replace plan does to maintain health care coverage for the sum of the millions of people in danger of losing it.  Wouldn’t you create chaos for a lot of those people?  ",2,273.0,54.0,host,49.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
56,JORDAN,"  No, the effective date for that is two years out.  It's the same thing we put on President Obama's desk, Chris.  Why not put that on President Trump's desk?  We think we’re going to get a different outcome.  We believe President Trump will sign it.   Understand the speaker’s plan doesn't repeal ObamaCare.  Even Charles Krauthammer said that, called it ObamaCare-light, as you said earlier.  It doesn't bring down premiums and it doesn't unite Republicans.   So, why not do what we all voted for just 15 months ago, clean repeal, and then get focused and build some momentum to actually replace ObamaCare with something that’s going to bring down costs?  ",2,658.0,113.0,guest,50.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
57,WALLACE,"  But I don't have to tell you, the problem is that you can repeal ObamaCare under this plan with 51 votes because it's part of budget reconciliation.  ",2,152.0,29.0,host,51.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

62,JORDAN,"  Yes.  And -- well, the speaker’s plan is the same thing.  It talks about things we have to do in phase three that you have you’re going to need more votes for it.   And if we want to -- we want to put more in this first reconciliation bill, actually get after the insurance regulations that we think are driving up the cost for working-class families and middle-class families, then let's do that.  And we can challenge the Senate and take that to the Senate, and maybe have a ruling with a parliamentarian there.  But we can do it that way as well.   The key is let’s do what we told the voters we were going to do.  Let’s repeal ObamaCare, not create some different form of ObamaCare.  ",2,690.0,132.0,guest,56.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
63,WALLACE,"  Yes, but -- so I -- this is, I was going to ask you, one of the other things you’re talking about doing, basically blowing up the Senate rules.  To do what?  ",2,160.0,34.0,host,57.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
64,JORDAN,"  To actually repeal ObamaCare.  And right now, everyone knows the insurance regulations, all the mandated coverage are in there that drive up the cost for everyone.  Those have to be dealt with if we’re ultimately going to bring down the cost for working-class families and middle-class families.  And if we can put that in this bill and get over there, we may have a parliamentary ruling on it.  But I think we can win that as well, and use that strategy to actually repeal and replace it with something that’s going to be helpful (ph).  ",2,540.0,97.0,guest,58.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
65,WALLACE,"  But, Congressman, here’s the problem -- if you blow up the Senate rules and you basically say, you can pass almost anything under reconciliation with 51 votes, then you’re ending the filibuster.  You were saying a majority can do anything they want.   Back in 2009, there was a simple majority, but not a filibuster-proof majority of Democrats who wanted universal health care and they couldn't do it because under -- they couldn't get the 60 votes to do that.  So, that's one problem with it.  I mean, if you blow up the rules, yes, it will work for you now, but when the Democrats come back in, and they will eventually, then they can do anything they want by 51 votes.",2,673.0,123.0,host,59.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
66,JORDAN,  That -- Chris --  ,2,20.0,6.0,guest,60.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
67,WALLACE,"  And the other thing, I don't mean to be harsh, is I’ve talked to some senators who say they don't want a congressman telling them how to run their chamber.  ",2,159.0,32.0,host,61.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
68,JORDAN,"  That's fine.  Valid point, Chris.  What I do know is what we told the American people.  And we told them we were going to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something that’s going to bring the cost of insurance.  That’s what we told them.   This legislation that the speaker has brought forward doesn't do that.  We didn't tell the American people we were going to repeal ObamaCare but keep some of the taxes in there.  We didn't tell the American we were going to repeal ObamaCare and take the Medicaid expansion and extend it.   We didn't tell them we were going to repeal ObamaCare and get rid of the mandate but yet bring back this 30 percent penalty that’s in the bill.  We didn't tell them we were going to have this insurance subsidy in the bill either.  So, let's do what we said.   Right now, the thing that should unite us is what we all voted on before.  I mean, every Republican 15 months ago voted for the clean repeal.  Why is it OK to say, at campaign time, we’re going to do this and then once you get in office, oh, wait a minute, we’ve got to change what we told the voters we’re going to do?  I don't think that's why they sent us here.   So, let's pass that and then let's move on to do the other things we have to do to fix this.  ",2,1256.0,245.0,guest,62.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
69,WALLACE,"  Look, this is clearly going to be a negotiation between you and the House and the Senate Republicans and the White House.  And part of the problem is a different House members, different conservatives, frankly, in your caucus have different wish lists.   And the question I have is, has the House Freedom Caucus come down with a final wish list, what you can live with, and what you can't live with?  ",2,403.0,74.0,host,63.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
70,JORDAN,"  I think you first got to start here, Chris -- there's a reason why every single major conservative group in the country is opposed to the speaker’s plan.  There's a reason why so many conservative health care experts are opposed to the plan.  There's a reason why five conservative senators are opposed to the plan and there's a reason why conservatives in the House are also opposed.  ",2,388.0,69.0,guest,64.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
71,WALLACE,"  But, sir, you’re not answering my question.  Have you got a final --",2,70.0,14.0,host,65.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
72,JORDAN,  It doesn't solve the problem.  ,2,33.0,7.0,guest,66.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

74,JORDAN,  We’re working on that.  The president has been very clear that he wants negotiation.  They’re open to change.  Your previous guest just talked about they’re open to changes. We’re working on that.  We’re going to be at the White House on Tuesday.  We are open -- we are looking at those issues that we think can make this bill consistent with what we told the American people we were going to do.  ,2,400.0,74.0,guest,68.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
75,WALLACE,"  Well, let's talk about a couple of the sticking points for you and other conservatives in the so-called Paul Ryan bill.  One of them is the refundable tax credits which you call a new entitlement, and a substitute for subsidies.",2,230.0,41.0,host,69.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
76,JORDAN,  Yes.,2,6.0,2.0,guest,70.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
77,WALLACE,"  But other conservatives and, Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, say look, people who get their health insurance on the job get a tax break because their -- that benefit is not taxed.  This is just treating people who buy health insurance on the individual market the same way.  It's a level playing field.  ",2,329.0,59.0,host,71.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
78,JORDAN,"  Fair enough, Chris, and we've been fine with tax credits.  Our concern is, you want to give tax credits to people who actually have a tax liability.  If you don't, it's nothing more than a subsidy.   What we really are focused on is, we want to bring back affordable insurance, not just some subsidy for the government to buy some plan that the government approves, not to put more people on Medicaid, but to actually have those working-class families be able to shop for a plan, an affordable plan, that meets their families need.  That's a much better option than signing people up for a government-type program.  So, that's what we’re focused on accomplishing.  ",2,667.0,117.0,guest,72.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
79,WALLACE,"  Well -- all right, let me -- before we get into that, le me ask you about another aspect of the repeal and replace plan, which is Medicaid expansion.  Now, the White House and Paul Ryan are talking about phasing that out, the expansion that has allowed millions, 11 million people to get health insurance who didn't have it before ObamaCare.  They’re talking about phasing that out by 2020.  You want to end it right away.   Isn't that going to create chaos and throw millions of people off health insurance?  ",2,512.0,93.0,host,73.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
80,JORDAN,"  Chris, the plan we passed and every Republican supported last Congress said there's a two-year effective date.  So, you would repeal ObamaCare, but there is still two years transition time.  Everyone knows you need to transition time to bring back a marketplace.   So, again, this is -- I don’t view success as keeping Americans on Medicaid.  I view success as bringing down the cost of insurance so families can pick the plan that fits their need.  That’s what we're doing.  We have a two-year transition time for that.   And again, remember what we told the voters, we said we were going to repeal ObamaCare, not keep Medicaid expansion around forever.  We said we were going to do repeal it.  So, let's do that, let's be consistent with what we told the American people we were going to accomplish when they sent us here to Washington.  ",2,842.0,149.0,guest,74.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
81,WALLACE,"  Here is what House Republican Speaker Ryan says is the bottom line.  Even if it doesn't meet all of your demands, he says that this plan, this repeal and replace plan, is a lot better than continuing with ObamaCare.  And he points out these measures in the plan of what it will do, it would end the individual and employer mandates.  It would expand health savings accounts, make it possible for people to put more money into the HSA’s.  And it would create a path to turn the Medicaid entitlement into a block grant to states.   If you block this plan, are you willing to blow up repeal and replace, something that -- as you pointed out, Republicans have been promising for seven years?  Are you prepared to deliver what could be --  ",2,737.0,136.0,host,75.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

84,JORDAN,"  Chris, as the speaker said, it's not a binary choice.  That's not how the legislative process works.  This idea that they had the bill hidden away, introduced it five days ago and you’ve got to take it or leave it, that's not how American democracy works.  I represent three quarters of a million people, as do all of other members.  We’d like a chance to amend it, change it, and make it consistent with the message we told the voters we were going to accomplish.  ",2,468.0,87.0,guest,78.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

89,JORDAN,"  Chris, they all just voted for a few months ago, the clean repeal that we introduced this week.  So, it's OK to say I voted for it during campaign time, but now when it counts, you can't do it?  It seems to me the binary choice if there is one here, is to say, look, either work with all the folks in the conservative movement, all the Republicans around the country who say this plan is not what we need to do.  Either work with us or you don't end up getting the votes.  That’s the real choice here. So, I hope they’ll work with us, I hope they’ll have the same -- I hope the speaker and our leadership will have the same attitude White House does, which is, let's work together and find a plan that works for the American people and that is consistent with what we told them we were going to do when they gave up the privilege to serve.  ",2,843.0,167.0,guest,82.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

111,WALLACE," Vice President Pence making the case in Kentucky Saturday for the GOP's new health care plan, while House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi defends the ObamaCare law she worked so hard to pass. And it's time now for our Sunday group. Jason Riley from The Wall Street Journal, Fox News political analyst and columnist for The Hill, Juan Williams. Julie Pace, who covers the White House for the Associated Press, and Michael Needham, head of the conservative think tank, Heritage Action for America. Well, Michael, you say that there's no significant difference between ObamaCare and the repeal and replace plan. You were one of the leaders of outside groups who met with President Trump at the White House this week. Did you tell him that?",4,736.0,125.0,host,97.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
112,"MICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA"," We had a great meeting. I thought that the president was open to feedback. I think that what Gary Cohn said earlier about them looking for improvements was absolutely the case. It was productive and we moved the ball forward. The problem is that the spirit that the president was bringing of openness to improvement has not been the spirit has Capitol Hill, the congressional leadership, has bought without their binary choice either take it or leave it approach. The fundamental problem is that this bill keeps the architecture of ObamaCare in place. ObamaCare has a whole series of regulations that drive up the cost of buying health insurance. Many of those regulations stay in place. Because these regulations dry up the cost of health insurance, to keep people in buying health insurance, ObamaCare has an individual mandate, which would penalize people for not buying health insurance. This bill gets rid of the individual mandate and replaces it with a mandate on insurers of the 30 percent tax to try to have continuous coverage. And because you've now driven up the cost of health insurance and your requiring people, or incentivizing people to buy these overly expensive plans that they don't want to purchase, you then had a large subsidy. ObamaCare has a large subsidy. That’s replaced with a different former of subsidy. This bill keeps the architecture of ObamaCare in place and that's why it needs to be improved and it needs to be improved a lot if we’re going to make it great.",4,1495.0,256.0,guest,98.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
113,WALLACE,"  Juan, I want to pick up on that because while some liberals -- and we just heard Nancy Pelosi complaining bitterly -- there are others who are claiming victory and exactly on Michael’s point, they say that this bill maintains the basic structure, architecture of ObamaCare, in the sense that there will continue to be government regulations of the health insurance industry in the fact that even after it is scaled-back, that Medicaid will -- there will actually be more people under Medicaid than were before ObamaCare. So they say, in effect, that Obama has won.",4,566.0,97.0,host,99.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
114,"JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST"," Well, I think Obama has -- president -- former President Obama has won in the terms that you now have Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives saying, the government has an important role to play here. But I would object to this way of thinking about the question, Chris, in this regard. When you say ObamaCare-lite, it suggests, oh, this is just a little different than ObamaCare. No big deal. I think it is a big deal from the left's perspective because you have fewer people insured. The whole point of the deal was to increase the number of people who had health insurance in America. Twenty million gained health insurance from ObamaCare. This would decrease the number of people who have health insurance. It would drive up the cost of health insurance, especially -- and I find this ironic -- for older, low income voters, many of whom, especially white lower income voters, were Trump supporters. Those people are going to be hurt by this plan. You have the AMA, the American Medical Association, the nurses, the hospitals, all of them saying this doesn't work -- this doesn’t improve health care for Americans.",4,1133.0,195.0,guest,100.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
115,WALLACE," We asked you for questions for the panel, and we got a bunch from people who are upset about the disarray that we’re seeing -- and we’ve seen on this show -- about repealing ObamaCare.

""1."" -- this is for Republicans, ""what have you been doing since it was passed back in 2010? 2. Why weren't you ready to go on day one for President Trump?""

116,"JASON RILEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," Well, one problem is that the Democrats have been slow-walking a lot of the nominees that Trump has put forward. So he hasn't had a lot of time to -- to work with his team in place. And now that he does have his team in place, I think things are moving on. But, Chris, conservatives have to decide whether they’re going to do what is achievable and pragmatic here, or whether they’re going to make the perfect enemy of the good here. And the reality here is that a lot of the stuff in this bill Paul Ryan doesn't like. You know, he doesn't like the Medicaid expansion. He doesn't like using tax credits instead of tax deductions. And if you were building a system from scratch, they wouldn't be in there. But he’s not building a system from scratch. He’s building a system from ObamaCare. And he wants to move gradually. He wants to move pragmatically. He wants to move in a way that this can get through both chambers of Congress. The Republicans don't have a lot of wiggle room. They can only afford to lose about 12 people maybe in the House. In the Senate, the narrow -- the margin is much narrower there.",4,1110.0,209.0,guest,102.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

What they’re proposing going through is the exact opposite. You do the rest now with 51 votes and then we’re going to magically get 60 votes, eight Democrats, to say, hey, now that you passed your bill that keeps that architecture in place, we’re going to join you to tear down the architecture?

How much credit do you think President Trump -- you heard Gary Cohn say the CEOs are in, they’re excited, they’re going to start investing and hiring -- how much credit do you think President Trump legitimately deserves for the good jobs numbers and Gary had to kind of -- as you expect anybody in the White House to do, duck on the question of the Fed.

136,"JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"," Well, I think when you look at the jobs numbers, there are two pieces of this. One, the U.S. economy is massive and it doesn't turn on a dime. So a lot of what you're seeing in the jobs numbers is part of patterns and trend lines that we saw last year under President Obama. At the same time, I think it's undeniable that there is a level of confidence on Wall Street among some of these executives that had been meeting with the president lately that may be contributing to the --",4,482.0,94.0,guest,122.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

138,PACE," They are up. The -- that confidence, though, is based in part on passing a repeal and replace of ObamaCare, passing a -- a big tax reform overhauled. And so if those packages don't get through this year, you may see that confidence start to decline a bit. So there is a lot of pressure on the White House to make good on those promises. And when it comes to the Fed rate hike, look, there is some nervousness. They -- they are limited in what they can say publicly, obviously, because the Fed is independent, but there is some nervousness that if you have growth start to roll back and you are in the middle of a really tough ObamaCare debate and tax reform gets pushed off longer, then we're suddenly looking at a much different economic picture than what they feel like they have -- they have walked into right now.",4,818.0,154.0,guest,124.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
139,WALLACE," And -- and in 30 seconds, I will to take you back to the whole ObamaCare thing.

How scared are they about that?",4,409.0,80.0,host,125.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
140,PACE," Well, I think the preemptive spinning that you’re seeing of numbers that aren’t even out yet tell you everything that you need to know. They -- they know that there is going to be some number out there, perhaps up to 15 million, we don’t know exactly, of people who will lose coverage. And even if they are discrediting that number, that is going to be a pretty powerful figure for opponents both on the left and the right to wield against this plan.",4,451.0,85.0,guest,126.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

148,WALLACE," The Trump administration's tone towards former national security advisor Michael Flynn changing sharply after revelations he was paid to work on behalf of the Turkish government during the presidential campaign. And we’re back now with the panel. Well, let me reset for all of you, Michael Flynn was perhaps Donald Trump's top foreign policy advisor during the campaign, but he registered this week as a foreign agent for work he did at that same time, during the campaign, for the government of Turkey. And it turns out the Trump transition, after the election, was told about this other job. Julie, the White House says that the president, at any point in this process, as a candidate, as a president-elect and as president was never told that Michael Flynn was moonlighting, that he had another job. Do you find that as hard to believe as I do?",5,848.0,147.0,host,131.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
149,PACE," I do because there were public reports about what Michael Flynn was doing. Even after the election you had Elijah Cummings, a Democrat, sending a letter to Mike Pence asking the White House to look into this, raising questions about this. And even if we do take the White House’s word on this and accept that no one passed this information on to Donald Trump, I'm not sure that makes it better because then you’re in a situation where you have the person was is now the White House counsel receiving word from Flynn’s lawyer that he may have to register as a foreign agent and not feeling as though that raised red flags about his participation at a high level in the White House, not raising that issue to the White House. So I think either way the president was aware and didn't think it was concerning, or if top staffers didn't bring this to the White House, I don't think the Trump administration comes out looking very good here.",5,936.0,172.0,guest,132.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

151,PACE," Well, it is gone, but I think that this opens up a whole new avenue in terms of looking at Flynn and -- and what he was doing during the campaign and then during the transition and his brief time of the White House. We’ve been focused a lot on his conversations with the Russian ambassador, but now I think that we’re going to start to dig in more on what he was doing for this company that could have benefited the Turkish government.",5,436.0,85.0,guest,134.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
152,WALLACE,"  Jason, maybe I'm old-fashioned -- I’m, in fact, I am old-fashioned, but I’ve got to say, I find it shocking that here is the top national security advisor to the presidential nominee of the Republican Party, one of the two people who's going to be president, who was participating in top secret, classified briefings and it turns out that he was working for another country at the same time.",5,393.0,70.0,host,135.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
153,RILEY," And not just another country, I mean Turkey isn't France or Britain. Turkey has taken a sharp turn for the worse in recent years. And so it's doubly disturbing, I think, that it -- that we’re talking about Turkey here. And we can only hope that the administration does a better job of vetting its other top officials. The other thing that disturbed me about this episode was just the lack of communication among the administration. Here you had Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, out there still defending Flynn, saying his credentials are impeccable. Then you had the vice president telling Bret Baier, you know, what -- now you know why we fired him. I mean there -- there needs to be better communication in terms of messaging coming out of this administration. We've seen this on other issues before. I think they really need to get their act together.",5,862.0,152.0,guest,136.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
154,WALLACE," To make the point, though, Flynn is saying that his lawyers notified -- during the transition, not during the campaign, but during the transition -- notified Don McGahn, who ended up as the White House counsel, about the fact that he had done this work and that he might -- and asking whether he needed to register as a foreign agent, which he ended up doing just this last week. Is it conceivable to you that that information would not be passed on to the president-elect before he decides to make this man his national security advisor?",5,539.0,98.0,host,137.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

Were they wrong then and do they need to apologize?",5,286.0,48.0,host,144.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
164,NEEDHAM," Well, WikiLeaks is an enemy about the United States, and I think both sides, over the last couple of years, have had times where, for partisan, political reasons, WikiLeaks has appeared to be useful. You talk about in the -- the last couple years with the election, but earlier when there was embarrassing things coming out on WikiLeaks about the Bush administration or otherwise, there were people on the left who were praising WikiLeaks. Certainly during the Snowden time there were people who were praising that. We have a big problem in this country if there is somebody inside the CIA leaking this type of information. It’s an incredibly serious thing. It has to be taken care of. And both sides need to recognize that WikiLeaks is not something that should be embraced for domestic, partisan politics. It's something that we all, as Americans, need to be deeply concerned about.",5,885.0,151.0,guest,145.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
165,WALLACE," I want you to -- because this is a -- an issue that's being debated in the conservative community, though. You say that you believe that WikiLeaks and Julian Assange are enemies of this country?",5,195.0,36.0,host,146.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
166,NEEDHAM, I think that we need to be able to have a conversation in this country about what is the right balance between security and privacy. Those are important conversations. They’re conversations that largely need to happen inside the -- the -- Capitol Hill and with people who are elected by us to represent our interests and have security clearances. But certainly that's a valid question for us to be having. It is not a conversation that should be run by foreign actors and foreign actors tied to a country like Russia. That's obviously not the appropriate way for a democratic country to debate difficult subjects.,5,614.0,106.0,guest,147.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
167,WALLACE," Juan, Michael makes a good point. I mean, yes, in the last year or so it's the conservatives who have embraced WikiLeaks and its revelations about Hillary Clinton and the campaign and Podesta and the Democratic National Committee, but there was a time with the original WikiLeaks dump, the Bradley Manning, Chelsea Manning stuff, that it was liberals who were talking about it.",5,378.0,64.0,host,148.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
168,WILLIAMS," Well, there's a key distinction here, Chris. Remember, in the one case we're talking about things that involve domestic intervention, spying on people here in the United States. What was revealed this week was about CIA methods, sources, tactics overseas. Is anybody saying that the CIA shouldn't be spying on our enemies, shouldn't be keeping us safe? That’s -- of course they should be. So all this is the work, to my mind, of Assange and WikiLeaks as really puppets for the Russians, because I think that’s clear now, that's where the information is coming from, and they are driving this whole argument, I think, one, in terms of the election, as you pointed out, to undermine trust and faith in American democratic processes. But secondly, now to undermine faith and confidence in an American institution, the Central Intelligence Agency, and I think they do this quite directly in service to Russian agenda.",5,914.0,154.0,guest,149.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

190,WALLACE," She was very polite there. President Trump refusing to answer any questions from reporters on Russia this week after accusing Barack Obama last weekend of wiretapping Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign. And we’re back now for one last go around with the panel. Julie, this is a pretty dramatic shift for this White House. I’m going to put up the picture here. When the president signed the revised executive order this week banning travel from six countries, all they did was release this photo but didn't let any reporters in and officials there are now saying that since the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are investigating, that they will have no more comment on the president's charge. Julie, what's your sense? Do they have any evidence to back up the president on this charge about President Obama and wiretapping Trump Tower or not?",6,852.0,145.0,host,168.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
191,PACE," It doesn't appear as though they do. I think we’ll wait to see if they turn anything over to the committee tomorrow. But most people at the White House would just like this to go away. The problem with that is that this was something that was raised by the president himself, which makes it pretty hard for both of us in the media and the investigative committees on The Hill to just put this aside. But the way that they structured this week was so fascinating. I will give this White House credit for these opening weeks of the administration. We have had a lot of access to this president. He had a lot of events that are on camera. He does take shouted questions from reporters. But we did not get that opportunity this week. There’s a press conference on Tuesday with Angela Merkel from Germany, hoping that we’ll be able to ask these questions there.",6,857.0,159.0,guest,169.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

193,NEEDHAM," Well, look, I think we should let the House do its investigation. There are a lot of absurd claims going around. There's absolutely no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians on the election.

194,WALLACE," Well, and let's pick up on that because we had another week of the FBI director, James Comey, walking all over the Capitol, meeting with top congressional leaders. And as you point out, still no word about any evidence of collusion between the original charge, the original, quote, scandal between the Russians and Trump world. Jason, is it possible, in fact likely at this point, that there's no evidence against Donald Trump and there's no evidence for Donald Trump when it comes to his charge?",6,497.0,86.0,host,172.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12
195,RILEY," Yes, it is possible. I mean there is no evidence of direct collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. And there's no evidence that President Obama had any knowledge of directly wiretapping of Trump Tower. So we -- right now we have a clash of conspiracy theories right now. And I think the president is right to go silent on this issue until the committees can do their investigation. But it's probably something he shouldn't have raised in the first place and he’s got his whole staff scrambling now to come up with the evidence.",6,543.0,97.0,guest,173.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-12

40,COTTON,"  Well, I try not to parse and review every one of President Obama’s -- President Trump's tweets, Chris.  I prefer to focus on things like his speech to Congress the other night where he laid out an hour long speech, a very careful plan of action.  I think that’s a better guide to what he's thinking, and where he wants to take the country, just like his appointments to his cabinet and the policies he's pursuing.  ",1,417.0,78.0,guest,37.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05

44,COTTON,"  Yes.  Chris, I was actually in Heber Springs yesterday morning.  We had a town hall with over 450 Arkansans.  And for almost an hour and a half got a lot of questions.  We only got one question about this.   Almost all the questions were about health care and the harms that ObamaCare caused or the immigration and failure to enforce our immigrant laws under President Obama's tenure, or rebuilding our military to face the challenges that we face, or -- to include from Russia.  This kind of topic is not going to do much to bring these people comfort that we’re going to fix their health care system or immigration laws.

46,COTTON,"  I think what -- I mean, I think Twitter is an important medium that politicians can use to communicate, just like FDR started using radio addresses.  Just like President Obama changed the radio address to a weekly YouTube address.   But ultimately, a better guide for an elected official’s actions are their prepared deliberate speech, like the president gave to Congress the other night, which was well-crafted and well-delivered, and especially the policies they pursued.   And for six weeks now, President Obama has appointed members to his cabinet.  ",1,556.0,91.0,guest,43.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05

48,COTTON,"  President Trump has appointed members to his cabinet and they've made deliberate statements that have been tougher on Russia than anything President Obama ever did. If you want to know what a pro-Russia policy would look like, Chris, here’s some elements of it.  You’d slash defense spending.  You’d slow down our nuclear modernization. You’d roll back missile defense systems.  You would enter a one-sided nuclear arms control agreement.  And you’d try to do everything you could to stop oil and gas production.   That was Barack Obama's policy for eight years.  That's not Donald Trump's policy.  None of those things are good for Russia that Donald Trump’s proposed to do to roll back some of those Obama era policies.",1,723.0,120.0,guest,45.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
49,WALLACE,"  I just want to -- and I’m sure some people are saying enough already, but I do want to follow up one more time.  There is the possibility, as you say you will investigate it, that it's true.   There's also the possibility that it isn't true and that the president just blew off the handle.  That would be pretty troubling, wouldn’t it, the idea that a president would make a charge this explosive about another president without any evidence?",1,444.0,81.0,host,46.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
50,COTTON,"  Well, all presidents are human, Chris.  And if a lot of the allegations in the media are false, and I can tell you based on things I do know, there are many inaccurate reports circulated in the media over the last several months.  It's understandable that Donald Trump would be frustrated at the leaks of inaccurate information, which also have the potential to reveal capabilities of the United States that we don't want our adversaries to know.  ",1,450.0,79.0,guest,47.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
51,WALLACE,"  OK.  We've talked enough about the tweets.   Let's step back and look at the big picture, because the Senate Intelligence Committee has been investigating this whole issue for some period of time.  And again, I’m only asking you what you know.  Have you seen any evidence so far in this investigation, hard evidence of collusion between what I will call ""Trump world"" and Russia or Russian agents to interfere with the election?  ",1,432.0,75.0,host,48.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
52,COTTON,"  Chris, I’ve seen no evidence, and again, I would just say that media reports have gotten pretty far gone over their skis on this.  Maybe the most explosive story came from The New York Times about four weeks ago, claiming that several known Trump associates were being investigated for repeated and extensive contacts with Russian intelligence officials.  And as I cautioned Arkansas this weekend, I would say to your viewers, you should not trust media sources or media reports based on anonymous sources.   The one thing you can trust in those articles is the caveats that undermine the headlines and the lead paragraphs.  And in that very New York Times story, the third paragraph said there was no evidence so far of any such cooperation.  ",1,746.0,128.0,guest,49.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
53,WALLACE,"  And you as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I know you've been briefed by FBI Director Comey and other members of the intelligence committee and investigative committee, you've seen no evidence so far of collusion?  ",1,232.0,39.0,host,50.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
54,COTTON,"  Thus far, I have not.   Now, we are still in a relatively early stages of our inquiry and it will be thorough and white-ranging and follow the facts wherever they take us.  But I would simply caution your viewers again -- do not to credit media reports based on anonymous sources.  It doesn’t mean you should discard them, doesn’t mean they’re false.  We’ll review these allegations, but I’m encouraging your viewers not to take them at face value.  ",1,452.0,81.0,guest,51.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05

67,WALLACE,"  Well, next time, because here's the point, sir.  President Trump is living under a cloud and his agenda is being sidetracked by continued leaks from inside the government.  The New York Times reported this week, this was one of those media stories, that the Obama administration disseminated intelligence widely about Russia and Mr. Trump to assure it wasn't destroyed.   Do you believe there's an effort inside this government to undercut President Trump and to derail his agenda?  ",1,485.0,80.0,host,60.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
68,COTTON,"  Well, Chris, that New York Times story to me just doesn't make sense on its face.  I mean, the intelligence community doesn't willy-nilly destroy intelligence that has been collected.   I would point out to your viewers that the FBI is not just a law enforcement agency, it’s part of our intelligence services, it does counterintelligence.  The FBI reports to the Department of Justice, which is run by political appointees.  Until January 20th, those political appointees were Barack Obama's appointees, just like the members of his National Security Council was.   Now, there's obviously been a lot of leaks coming out from either current or especially former administration officials.  I suspect that most of the information comes from former Obama officials who still have not come to grips with the fact that Donald Trump won this election.   And story right here, again, this doesn’t make sense on its face.  That information is preserved.  It's almost always shared with Congress.  So, any efforts to destroy it would not be effective.   And, finally, as part of our inquiry on the intelligence committee, we've been given access to highly sensitive, foundational documents that were the basis of the intelligence community’s Russian assessment.  That didn't happen in the Obama administration.  That happened in the Trump administration.  ",1,1349.0,216.0,guest,61.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
69,WALLACE,"  Finally, we have another development this week and that was that Attorney General Sessions recused himself from any involvement in this investigation.   Do you trust the Justice Department now with Sessions out of it to investigate itself, or given the fact that if President Trump is right, he has disclosed information he shouldn't about a wiretap that would be part of this investigation?  Do you think there's a need for a special counsel to handle this matter going forward?  ",1,483.0,82.0,host,62.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
70,COTTON,"  I see no reason for that at this point, Chris.  I would like to see politically accountable officials make decisions, which means I’d like to see the Senate move promptly to confirm President Trump’s deputy attorney general and associate attorney general.  I think the American people deserve democratically accountable officials making these decisions. But at this point, there’s no -- I see no reason why that would be necessary.  I also see no reason why we would try to appoint some kind of independent or special committee or commission, in part because it would delay our conclusions.  The Senate Intelligence Committee’s work is underway.   We have the staff.  We get appropriate clearances.  We have the space.  We have the infrastructure.  We've made the decisions, or we’ve made the agreements with the intelligence community, review the documents. If you started over with a new commission or a new committee, that could take months.  I think it's in the best interest of the American people if we conduct our review as quickly as possible and make as much of our conclusions as public as possible.  ",1,1113.0,186.0,guest,63.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05

75,WALLACE,"  Now, we continue our coverage of the latest developments in the Trump-Russia story with the president accusing former President Obama of tapping his phones in Trump Tower before the election.   Joining us now, Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware. And, Senator, I want to begin where I began with Senator Cotton -- your reaction to President Trump's allegations that his phones were tapped by President Obama.  ",2,419.0,69.0,host,67.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
76,COONS,"  Well, Chris, these are remarkable allegations.  I think another attempt by President Trump to change the subject.  But this deserves a full investigation.   And the larger point, I think, I will agree with Senator Cotton on, is that it's in the best interest of our country for us to move forward promptly and get to the bottom of all of this.  I believe that no president should ever directly order and intercept a wiretap on an American citizen.  That's not what our system provides.  You have to go in front of a judge and get a warrant in order to conduct a wiretap. So, one of two things has happened here.  Either President Trump has inappropriately released classified information and was himself a subject of a court-ordered wiretap, or -- and I think this is a very remote possibility -- there was some inappropriate actions by the previous administration.   In either case, it doesn't help our country for this to all be worked out on Twitter.  It ought to be worked out in a full, fair, prompt, and thorough investigation, whether by the Senate Intelligence Committee, if they can get to the bottom of this, or by a special prosecutor.  ",2,1150.0,204.0,guest,68.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05

82,COONS,"  What I was trying to make clear, Chris, and I appreciate a chance to restate this, is that I don't have, and I don't know of, any conclusive proof one way or the other about whether there was collusion between senior levels of the Trump campaign and Russian officials.  But I believe that our intelligence community, which is the most sophisticated in the world, has intercepts, has raw intelligence, and it's important that the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting an investigation be given access to those intercepts, to transcripts of those intercepts, so that they can get to the bottom of this.   The American people, Chris, want us to move forward.  They want us to work together in Washington and it's important for us to remember that the Russians are our adversaries.  Republicans and Democrats, we have different political agendas, different political views, but we can and should work together to make sure that what intelligence there is, is gotten access to by the intelligence committee.   And if they’re stonewalled or blocked, that there's a special prosecutor appointed.  That’s the point I was trying to make.",2,1143.0,190.0,guest,73.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05

87,WALLACE,"  Senator, we’re talking here about the president of the United States.  Isn't there more than a whiff of McCarthyism for you as a U.S. senator to say there are transcripts out there that provide insight into whether or not there was collusion, but you don't even know whether they exist?  ",2,290.0,52.0,host,76.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
88,COONS,"  Well, to be clear, Chris, what I was trying to encourage was that the intelligence committee be given access to the raw intelligence.  I’ve been told now that that's going to happen this coming week and I think that's positive and productive.   Last week on the floor of the Senate, I joined Republican Senator Marco Rubio in a joint speech to talk about Russian interference, Russia as our adversary and the importance of us working together.  At the end of speech, Senator Rubio said, ""I won't be part of a witch hunt, and it won’t be part of a cover-up."" So, to the extent of those comments, they might be some way misinterpreted as leading to sort of a hyperventilating attitude here in the Senate about this, I apologize for that.  That's not what I was trying to do.   What I was trying to do, and I think it's important, is to draw the American people to what joins us in common, which is the need for us to get to the bottom of this, to get access to what intelligence there is.  I am confident that intelligence exists that is relevant to this question.  Not that says there is collusion, and proof of it, that's not what I was trying to say.  ",2,1155.0,217.0,guest,77.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05

93,WALLACE,"  If I may, I want to talk about the broader story here.  Do you have any evidence at this point, in this investigation has been going on for a long period of time.  We know that the FBI and intelligence sources were looking at this at least in October, because that's when they all came out and said that the Russians were interfering.   Do you know of any hard evidence of collusion between what I call ""Trump world"" and the Russians to interfere in his presidential campaign?  Not suspicions, not contacts, but evidence of collusion.",2,536.0,97.0,host,82.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
94,COONS,"  Chris, I have no hard evidence of collusion.  I think what hard evidence there may be will be discovered either through a full release of President Trump's financial interests and concerns and taxes, or the intercepts that I believe our intelligence community and FBI have of conversations between and among Russian officials.  And that's why I think it's important for us to get the bottom of this, so we are not still talking about this as an unresolved issue where we don't know the answer months and months from now.  ",2,524.0,92.0,guest,83.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05

But, second, it seems to me, is there a political question, which is, why does Donald Trump want to keep breathing life into this story about the whole Russia-Trump connection at a – at the precise moment he's trying to unveil and push his agenda?",4,454.0,83.0,host,104.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
127,"LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST"," Well, perhaps one of the reasons – and I – I don't know, but I'm just speculating – perhaps one of the reasons is, is because the reporting on the Russia supposed connection, inclusion with the Trump campaign has been just feverishly overblown. The – the sound bite that you played, for instance, to – to Coons about Jeff Sessions, the entire sound bite where Al Franken is asking that question, which is really revealing, is – he’s like – it’s this rambling question about, well, CNN is reporting about some report that there might be compromising information. I don't even know if you've ever seen it, but – obviously the import of the question was, are you – are – are – did you speak with Russians in your capacity as a surrogate for the campaign, and was that about the campaign machinations and that was obviously the question. I actually don't think Jeff Sessions needed to recuse himself. I know that might be controversial, but if Jeff Sessions told the truth, and I believe he did in that – in that question and the follow-up questions, the written question submitted by Leahy, I don't think he had to recuse himself. I think Donald Trump’s probably frustrated about that. I think a lot of – a lot of pressure was put on Sessions to recuse himself. He was considering recusing himself earlier.

Janis Gibson, and this gets kind of to your point, Laura, Janis Gibson said this on Facebook. ""I honestly think the Dems are using this as a diversion. Of all the issues facing America, they focus on this. It's tiresome."" But John Ferguson sees it a bit differently. ""The Republicans would not let Benghazi and e-mail scandal go.

139,"DANA PERINO, CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"""," Yes. However, I do think that Washington is able to do a couple of things at once. So you have several investigations going on with this supposed collusion and now I guess the president's team has said that they are going to ask congressional committees to also add in this question of allegations that President Obama directly asked for a wiretap about President Trump. And I would imagine there’s about 50 percent of the people in America today who believe that actually happened, even if there’s no evidence of it, and the same is true from Democrats’ perspective, who think there’s collusion when there, as the senator said, there is no evidence that they’ve seen about that so far. But at the same time, tomorrow I believe you’ll have a new executive order from President Trump on the immigration issue. You’ll have an Obamacare plan that’s sort of put out there by the House team. And they have lots of different things that they have to do, including a budget, with members of the cabinet now having to go up to Congress and defend either a plus up for the military budget or the cuts that Donald Trump wants.

What do you make of the – of the story that came out of The New York Times this week that the Obama administration spread the intelligence like breadcrumbs so that it would be out there and people would continue to talk about it and perhaps these leaks would happen? And then what do you make of – of Donald Trump's tweets this weekend?,4,463.0,89.0,host,120.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
143,WOODWARD," Well, first of all, you've got to understand that as President Trump has this vast espionage establishment as his disposal, $50 billion a year plus, even in the CIA they call him the first customer. So he can get the information he wants. He's the only one in the government. The question is, did he just spontaneously, because he’d read something or heard something, put out this tweet, which is quite serious. We don't know. You’re absolutely right, no evidence on that. On the Russian collusion, there's a lot of smoke, no evidence. The other thing is, the mechanisms for investigating this are weak. Sessions, the attorney general, has recused himself. OK, how is the Justice Department, the FBI, going to really examine this? There's no independent counsel law. Special prosecutors don't work. Congress also is not very well-equipped to do this. They've had some flops in recent investigations. So the quality of information of evidence we’re liable to get is going to be weak.

158,WALLACE,"  President Trump appealing for unity in his speech to Congress this week. A moment that now feels like it was a long time ago. And we’re back with the panel. Dana, President Trump gave, in that speech to Congress, what most people think was a very effective speech, laying out his agenda. But we now hear that there are serious slips among Republicans in Congress on the issue of Obamacare repeal and replace and tax reforms. So what kind of shape – forget Russia – what kind of shape is the Obama – is the Trump agenda in?",5,524.0,99.0,host,133.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
159,PERINO," I think it's actually in better shape than maybe it looks on paper and that behind the scenes because you have good cooperation between President Trump, the vice president, because of his relationship with a lot of members on The Hills, and then McConnell, who runs his caucus very well. So there will be an Obamacare repeal and replacement. Not everyone’s going to agree. And I do think that President Trump will have to find time in his schedule to get out there and provide some explanation in the way that only he can, which is very direct and explains to people exactly how he thinks it will work and that everyone’s going to be taken care of. At the same time, you have other planes circling about the airport and that would be the Supreme Court nomination. That has got to figure out a way to get to land. And you’re going to have a debt ceiling debate in a couple of weeks as well. So lots of things happening. You’ve got to figure out how to sequence these things. Obamacare repeal and replacement will be first. And it will be hard.",5,1043.0,194.0,guest,134.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
160,WALLACE,"  Well, let’s – let's talk about that, Bob, because there is talk on Obamacare that – that House Speaker Ryan is going to end up putting a bill on the floor that he knows some conservatives in his own caucus think is too soft, still creates a government entitlement, uses these refundable tax credits to pay for it and basically dare conservatives to block it, saying if you’d want to stop repealing Obamacare, it’s on you.

161,WOODWARD," I mean if you take people and put them on sodium pentothal, the truth serum, and say, do understand Obamacare, everyone will agree they’re not sure that they do.

It’s going to be interesting to see if this comes together at all in a reasonable period of time.",5,371.0,70.0,guest,136.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05

163,WOODWARD," Well, Ryan has said privately, he thinks he has a good relationship with Trump on these domestic issues and that he can kind of call the shots. We're – we’re going to see. I – again, I'm – I’m not going to say a year or two again, but this could take a long time. And there’s this sense of, oh you can push a button and take a very complex, troubled law and fix it is a fantasy.",5,379.0,80.0,guest,138.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
164,WALLACE,"  Laura, let's drill down a little bit on – on – on a couple of the big political differences on Obamacare. One has to do this – with this question of how you’re going to help lower income people pay for insurance, people who aren’t covered by Medicaid, and there’s this idea of refundable tax credits, people would get money. As you know, some of the more conservative people say, hey, that's just another name for subsidies. It's the same deal. And you’re creating a new entitlement. There's also this question about the 11 billion people who gained coverage under the expansion of Medicaid. What happens to them? Those are really sizable issues.",5,648.0,114.0,host,139.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
165,INGRAHAM," It's always hard when you create a new entitlement to pull back on that entitlement. That’s why elections matter. When President Obama won in 2008, he came in, he passed Obamacare with not a single Republican vote and now it's – it’s such a labyrinthine mess of a – a piece of legislation that it’s like that old game Kerplunk. You pull one stick out, and the whole thing falls apart. I would say this, Chris, and a lot of – a lot of conservatives are calling into my radio show, they’re – they believe Donald Trump ran on a very serious reform agenda. That you weren't just going to be tinkering with some of these behemoths of government programs. You were really going to tackle them. And that means bring the cost of health care down. He talked about that a little bit in his speech. The prescription drug prices, which are skyrocketing. The cost of health care, which is – it needs to be busted up and dealt with by removing the anti-trust protections that health care providers get. Those are things that a lot of the Republicans don’t want to tackle. That would actually bring health care costs down by almost 60 to 70 percent says experts like Ramin Oskoui, the renowned cardiologist in Washington. That would bring care down so much that people could go to the doctor for a sore throat or a sprained ankle and pay nothing for it. But we’re going to tinker with – with the mandate and do a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Meanwhile, we might leave this iPad board, otherwise known as the death panel, still in the legislation. It still could survive in the Ryan legislation, which would – could lead to huge cuts in coverage down the road for all Americans. Dana’s right, the president needs to use his political capital in his election victory and go to Capitol Hill and be confident in what he wants and make that case to the American people. I don't think it can all be on Paul Ryan's shoulders. I think it’s got to be a broad-based pitch for real reform.",5,1980.0,367.0,guest,140.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05
166,WALLACE,"  But let me – let me bring Peter in here because, as Laura describes it, there is a huge political debate, even after seven years of talking about repealing Obamacare, there’s still a huge debate about how to replace it. And then you've also got the tax reform and his huge fight and there are a bunch of them, but the one that sort of has risen to the surface is about the border adjustment tax and whether you’re going to tax imports coming in or not. Do you get the sense that the Trump White House has a clear strategy, both in terms of political strategy, legislative strategy, and also in terms of substance, of how to get both of these through?",5,652.0,124.0,host,141.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-03-05

You’ve got the Gary Cohn, who’s the national economic advisor wing saying, no, that’s – that’s not the way we want to go. And they don’t know.

171,BAKER," That’s ultimately going to be have – the key, right, does the president make up his mind? At this point he hasn’t on some of these big issues and he has to sit down and say, OK, this is the way we’re going. Once he does that, then Republicans will start to fall in behind him presumably.

25,WALLACE,"  First, I want to get your thoughts about the election of Tom Perez, a relative centrist, as chair of the DNC.  What does it say to you about how Democrats are going to deal with President Trump?  ",1,198.0,39.0,host,22.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
26,LEWANDOWSKI,"  You know, Chris, what this says to me that they have now put someone in the chair of Democratic Party who doesn’t understand what’s going on in America.  You know, you have an opportunity, they would have had an opportunity to pick a candidate that understood what Middle America is about and not someone who’s just concerned about the East Coast or the West Coast.  And instead, what we’ve seen is, you know, more of the same from the Democratic Party, which is what caused them to lose this election at the presidential level.   Tom Perez was a close confidant of Hillary Clinton.  And if you look at the three major Democratic presidential candidates, whether it’s Michael Dukakis, Mondale, Wallace, the three of them combined could not have secured enough electoral votes to become elected president of the United States.  That's what this party represents, is completely out of touch with mainstream America, understanding that their base is on the rights and the far left of the political spectrum in the United States, all the way in California and in Massachusetts.  And this is just a terrible decision for these guys because they’re continuing to move to the left and forgetting what the real people care about.",1,1223.0,209.0,guest,23.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26

31,WALLACE,"  There certainly were all lots of ""ists"" there, corporatist, and globalist, and nationalist.  But you have said that you think that this president needs to have a laser focus on the economic agenda.  Does all of the -- do all of these attacks on the media and intelligence and opponents, does that get in the way of that message?  ",1,332.0,61.0,host,26.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
32,LEWANDOWSKI,"  Chris, what the problem is, is that the media continues to, you know, run a false narrative about the president.  And if we just cover him fairly, and what the president said in his press conference where he spent 77 minutes fielding questions from the media is, look, I’ll take that bad stories, but just report fairly and accurately on what we’re doing.  And they refused to do that.   Time and time again, we’ve seen front page stories in The Washington Post, in The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, which are just 100 percent factually inaccurate.  And the response is, oops, if we made a mistake, we will update it and the White House has denied these things.  ",1,672.0,122.0,guest,27.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
33,WALLACE,"  Why not just pursue his agenda?   Here's what President Trump tweeted late Friday night, ""Fake news media knowingly doesn’t tell the truth.  A great danger to our country."" He may be right in that or he may be wrong on it, Corey, but how many jobs does that create?  ",1,269.0,52.0,host,28.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
34,LEWANDOWSKI,"  Well, Chris, the president is out creating jobs.  We’ve seen what he’s done with Boeing Corporation.  We’ve seen what he’s done in the Carrier Corporation.  We see time and time again he is bringing companies in, saying, what can you do to create a better environment for the American business community?  He’s reducing regulations.  He’s passed the executive order that says for every new executive order, we’re going to reduce two executive orders, two regulations so that businesses can grow.   That’s what the president is doing.  He is bringing companies in to say, what can we do to grow?  The media doesn’t want to report that.   The media wants to report false stories of the removal of Martin Luther King Jr.'s bust from the Oval Office, which we know to be factually inaccurate.  They want to write a story about a story of national security which is absolutely, factually false, particularly when you have the director of national intelligence or you have the director of the CIA saying that the story that you have written has a false narrative in it, and the media doesn’t want to report that.  They have their own agenda. And this is the first president in a lifetime that has the ability to fight back through his almost 100 million people who follow him through the various mediums of social media.  He has to do this to get the real story out to the American people.",1,1385.0,244.0,guest,29.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
35,WALLACE,"  All right.  But I want to press my point on this.  There’s no question that the president has signed a number of executive orders and we’ve reported on all of them.   But in terms of his legislative agenda, he is falling behind where other new presidents have been at the same point in their terms.  And one of the questions I’ve got, particularly given the fact that he is going to give his speech to Congress this week, how important is it for him -- given the fact that there are some splits inside the Republican Party -- to give marching orders, give direction on where he wants to see Republicans in Congress, in the House and Senate, go in passing his agenda?  ",1,670.0,126.0,host,30.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
36,LEWANDOWSKI,"  It’s very important.  I think what this administration has said, and you heard from the secretary of the treasury, where they’re looking at the first full tax change since 1986, the first fundamental tax change.  They are hoping to get that done in the coming months.  We know that the president has said during his press conference that he is going to submit a plan for the full repeal and replace one of ObamaCare.   What we know about ObamaCare, Chris, is that premiums are up over at 100 percent in many of these states.  Private companies are pulling out.  The plans are a failure.  The promises that were to the American people of, if you want your doctor, if you like your plan, you can keep it, are not factually correct.   His agenda is moving forward through Congress.  What he has done in the first 35, or 36 days, is the executive orders that didn’t require the confirmation process or the approval of Congress, very important.   And if you look, he’s put coal miners back to work.  They were in the White House last week saying, ""Thank you, Mr. President, for giving us the opportunity to get back to work every day.""  He’s meeting with car executives.  He’s meeting with airline executives.  What can the government do to stimulate the economy so that we’re not growing at 1 percent, but we’re growing at 4 percent or 5 percent?   We finally have an OMB director, the Office of Management and Budget, who can finally look at the budget and as the president puts together his budget, it is his moral belief that the government needs to be leaner and more efficient and more business friendly.  I think that's what you’ll see coming out of his budget in the near future.  ",1,1686.0,305.0,guest,31.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
37,WALLACE,"  But, Corey, let me -- let’s take a specific example.  You mentioned a bunch there.  ObamaCare, repeal and replace.  Eleven million people gained health care coverage through the expansion of Medicaid.   There are now, as I say, there’s a split inside the Republican Party, because a lot of Republicans looked back home at their states where people gained coverage for the expansion of Medicaid.  They don’t want to give that up.  There are others who say, we want to stop the expansion of Medicaid.   Does the president need in his speech on Tuesday to help settle that issue, because there is a real split inside the GOP?  ",1,626.0,111.0,host,32.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
38,LEWANDOWSKI,"  I think what the president is going to use during his speech on Tuesday, he’s going to talk about a number of things.  He is going to talk about the accomplishments of his first month in office, the executive orders that he’s outlined.  The second thing he’s going to talk about, though, is the economic security our country needs, and that’s about education.  It’s about jobs.  That’s very important.   The third thing that I think the president is probably going to talk about is border security, taking care of our veterans, national security.  He has talked about this in general, the need to increase spending on the military.   But when it comes specifically to ObamaCare, Chris, you have to remember -- there are multiple states with the premiums for these people are up over 100 percent.  Small businesses can’t afford this.  Individuals who are on the plan --",1,870.0,151.0,guest,33.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
39,,(CROSSTALK),1,,,,,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
40,WALLACE,"  Corey, I understand the campaign against ObamaCare.  The question is, what are you going to do to replace it?  And that's what a lot of people are concerned about.   Let me ask you about another --",1,199.0,38.0,host,34.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
41,LEWANDOWSKI,  But that’s --  ,1,17.0,5.0,guest,35.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
42,WALLACE,  Go ahead.  ,1,13.0,4.0,host,36.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
43,LEWANDOWSKI,"  That’s what the White House is working on that right now with the members of Congress.  And what the president said during his press conference is, by the second or third week of March, he will have a plan up on the Hill.  The Hill is going to be working on this already to make sure that there is a unified component so that people can actually have health care coverage.   The president has been very clear about this.  He has a giant heart.  What he said was, we’re not going to throw people out in the street.  We’re going to take care of people.   But you have to do it in a manner that does not have increases of 100-plus percent so people can’t afford to cover themselves anymore.  ",1,691.0,134.0,guest,37.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
44,WALLACE,"  Let me move on to another subject.  The president also plans to roll out a revised travel ban this week that will cut people, visitors and refugees coming from certain countries.  But a report that was leaked this week by the Department of Homeland Security said this, and let’s put it up on the screen, ""Country of citizenship is unlikely, excuse me, is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity."" Two questions, what does the president do about these continued leaks from within his administration?  And secondly, you know, when you get something like this from DHS, there is a possibility that it might be blocked again, his new travel order.  Maybe he should forget about the travel orders and just go to extreme vetting.  ",1,755.0,130.0,host,38.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
45,LEWANDOWSKI,"  Well, let me say, the first part, you’re absolutely right.  And I think -- you know, I don’t speak for the administration.  I speak for Corey Lewandowski, citizen.   Any information that’s being leaked out of this administration needs to have a lid put on it and it’s very hard to do when you’ve got career bureaucrats sitting in these government agencies who have access to information that have a completely different agenda.  And if the Senate would confirm the president’s selections for secretary, and the under position, we can stop those things.  It's very important to do.  So, hopefully, the Senate will take those up and confirm those.   The second component of this is, if you listen to what John McCain said, someone who has been quick to criticize the president, he’s talked about General Mattis, and General Kelly, General McMaster, the entire national security team, he says it’s potentially the best national security team that has ever been assembled.  And when you look at that holistically and the advice that they are giving the president as it relates to a travel ban or having better vetting process, the president is very open in my opinion to listen to what those experts say, and writing a plan which will make sure first and foremost that the American people are safe and secure in their homeland.   If that means an extreme vetting process, if it means rethinking the way the State Department issues visas, then you have to do that.  It’s crystal clear, the Constitution is crystal clear.  ",1,1519.0,262.0,guest,39.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
46,WALLACE,  Corey --  ,1,12.0,4.0,host,40.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
47,LEWANDWOSKI,  The president has the presidential prerogative to stop anybody he wants from coming into the country by suspending visas with no question about it.  ,1,151.0,26.0,guest,41.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
48,WALLACE,"  Corey, I’ve got less than a minute to left, I want to ask you one last thing.  A top Republican, House Republican, Darrell Issa of California, came out over the weekend and said that he thinks that there should be a special prosecutor to investigate this question of leaks, of links rather between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence.  He says he doesn’t think that the Justice Department and Attorney General Sessions should do it because they are too close to President Trump. What do you think of Issa’s idea, special prosecutor?  ",1,544.0,94.0,host,42.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
49,LEWANDOWSKI,"  I think with all due respect, Senator Jeff Sessions, now Attorney General Jeff Sessions, has the utmost character and qualifications.  If he wants to investigate this under the Department of Justice, that’s his prerogative to do. Let me tell you, Chris --",1,257.0,43.0,guest,43.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26

51,LEWANDOWSKI,"  -- because I was on the campaign -- well, I don't know.  But let me tell you, because I was on the campaign for 18 months, I ran the campaign -- never, ever, ever did or anyone that I know of have communication or contact with anyone from Russia, or the Russian government, whatsoever.   So, look, I can tell you this: I have the utmost confidence in Attorney General Sessions, if he believes that there is something there, then he will investigate that.  I think he is completely capable and confident to do so.  He is a man of the utmost integrity and I believe it in his capable hands.  ",1,592.0,113.0,guest,45.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26

63,WALLACE,"  The reason I want you is to drill down on part of the Trump agenda and how it’s going to affect people in your states.  Let's start with ObamaCare repeal and replace, and we should point out, Governor McAuliffe, that in your state, even though you’re a Democratic governor, you couldn’t expand Medicaid as part of it, because Republican legislature blocked you. What are you concerned about in terms of replacement?  ",2,419.0,73.0,host,56.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
64,MCAULIFFE,"  Well, first of all, in Virginia, we did not.  We have forfeited $7.9 billion, Chris.  I could've had 400,000 individuals get health care, could have created 30,000 new jobs.   But my concern going forward is if we just eliminate the ACA, it costs the Virginia budget $200 million per year and lose $157 million pharmaceutical reimbursement right off the bat. So, I’m very concerned about how we do this going forward.  We don’t like bloc grants. If you’re going to bloc grant us, we’re going to have a set number and what happens if we have a recession?  What happens if the stock goes down? We at the state level have to incur those costs.  I’m very worried about the per capita rates. So, these are big issues.  But Scott is right, we’ll hear from the governors.  You know, I serve as chair of the governors.  We have 46, our biggest crowd ever.   We want to work together.  We want to get everybody quality health care.  We want personalized medicine.   I agree with Scott.  People need to be treated like individuals, and dignity, and not a number, but the devil is in the details.  ",2,1089.0,199.0,guest,57.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
65,WALLACE,"  All right.  Well, let’s talk a little bit about the details, Governor Walker, and I want to put some numbers because more than 200,000 people in Wisconsin have gained coverage under ObamaCare.  The uninsured rate in your state has fallen by 39 percent.   What happens if some of those people lose health care coverage under repeal and replace?  ",2,347.0,61.0,host,58.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
66,WALKER,"  Actually, ours is a model of exactly what will happen under replace and reform.  I didn’t take the expansion.  ",2,113.0,21.0,guest,59.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
67,WALLACE,  Right.  ,2,10.0,3.0,host,60.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
68,WALKER,  I didn’t --  ,2,15.0,5.0,guest,61.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
69,WALLACE,  But you have your own system.,2,31.0,7.0,host,62.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
70,WALKER,"  Not a state exchange.  No, ours is exactly what you want to model going forward.  For the first time ever, even without an ObamaCare expansion, I cover everybody living in poverty, 100 percent coverage for people living in poverty.  It never happened with Democrat, Republican governor ever before. For those above, we help transition them into the marketplace.  To me, that’s the goal.  As governors, for years, we’ve said not just in health care --",2,452.0,76.0,guest,63.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
71,WALLACE,"  But can you guarantee that all of those 200,000 people are going to keep coverage?  ",2,86.0,17.0,host,64.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
72,WALKER,"  Well, we have -- under our plan, we have one of the lowest rates of uninsured, in fact, one of the highest rates of overall insured in the nation, because we use reforms to help get people into the marketplace and to make things work there.  I think that’s exactly what we want has a nation.   Governors are more effective.  They’re more efficient.  They’re more accountable.  For years, governor have said, give us the tools not just on health care, but on education, transportation, and other issues.   Now is our chance to do it.  We just need to make sure that each of our state, we’re very unique, not only the Commonwealth of Virginia and Wisconsin, but all 50 states in their territories are unique.  We can make it work if governors work together with a president and the House that I hope will be receptive.  ",2,820.0,150.0,guest,65.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
73,WALLACE,"  OK.  Let's turn to another subject and that’s tax reform.  Governor McAuliffe, what do you think of the idea that Republicans, particularly in the House, are pushing of a border adjustment tax?  And, generally, what do you think of President Trump's talk of renegotiating trade deals?  ",2,288.0,48.0,host,66.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
74,MCAULIFFE,"  The border text is a disaster for the economy.  I mean, you look at Virginia, we’re a big ag state --",2,103.0,22.0,guest,67.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
75,WALLACE,"  Let me just quickly point out, border tax -- border adjustment tax, you would tax imports coming in.  You wouldn’t tax exports going out.  ",2,141.0,26.0,host,68.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
76,MCAULIFFE,"  Let's be very clear: countries around the globe are not going to sit there and wait for this.  They will reciprocate immediately against the United States of America.  I’m a big trade state.  I’ve been in 22 trade missions to dozens of countries.  Our economy is very strong today, Chris.   When I became governor, unemployment was 5.4.  We got it all the way to 3.7, 185,000 new jobs.  Why?  We’re trading around all over the globe.   If we treat countries like this, they are going to reciprocate against that.  I disagree with some of my party.  You give me a fair trade deal, protect worker rights, protect environmental rights, we in America can crush anybody around the globe.  We will win this argument.   But if we start putting walls up around our states and our country, you -- it’s a global economy.  Ninety-five percent of the world’s customers, Chris, live outside the United States of America.  We can’t just do trade with ourselves to grow our economy.  ",2,971.0,172.0,guest,69.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
77,WALLACE,"  Let me bring Governor Walker in this.   Your state exported $22 billion in goods to foreign markets in 2015.  Are you worried about if you set up border taxes, you set up border trade deals -- you get out of some of these trade deals, that it’s going to hurt that?  ",2,268.0,54.0,host,70.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
78,WALKER,"  We want good trade.  We want it to be fair and we want to be free.  We want to have trade with all of those different countries you talked about.  We want to make sure that if a Harley-Davidson is sold in Japan or China, it’s treated the same way that a Kawasaki or Toyota might be sold as it’s coming into the state of Wisconsin or any other state of the United States out there.  So, fair and free trade go hand in hand.   But I think the other issue that the House and the Senate really need to focus in on, certainly, what the president is talking about, is let's just bring the employer tax rate down so that it’s comparable with the rest of the industrialized world.  The states that have succeed, our state employed more people last year than ever before.  Why?  Because we got government out of the way, we lowered the tax burden, that by the time my budget is done, in eight years, we have cut taxes more than $8 billion --",2,934.0,181.0,guest,71.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
79,,(CROSSTALK),2,,,,,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
80,WALLACE,"  Let's talk about.  I mean, wouldn’t lowering corporate tax rates and making them more competitive with the rest of the world be a good idea?  ",2,144.0,27.0,host,72.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
81,MCAULIFFE,"  Oh, do I think we need tax reform?  Absolutely.  The more we can reform taxes and put more money into people’s pockets so they can spend more is by far the single biggest stimulus we can do for our economy today.   We definitely -- let's bring back this overseas money, repatriate this money that’s overseas, and let's bring it back to America.  We got to make it attractive to the individuals, and the CEOs, and the shareholders to bring the money back.  But, of course, we ought to do that.   And this is my point.  These are the big issues that I wish President Trump would focus on.  He ran on jobs.  Right now in Virginia, he is hurting me on jobs.   Let's go back to focusing on what we do in Virginia every day, rolling and diversifying our economy and to cyber security, solar, all the renewable energies, biotech -- that's how you grow economies.  We have 4.25 million workers in Virginia today, the most ever.  ",2,923.0,172.0,guest,73.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
82,WALLACE,"  I want to move on to another subject.  Governor Walker, you oppose candidate Trump’s Muslim ban during the campaign.  Is the new order that we understand the president is going to sign this week, is that in affect a cleaned up version of the same Muslim travel ban?  ",2,269.0,50.0,host,74.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
83,WALKER,  No.,2,5.0,2.0,guest,75.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
84,WALLACE,  And how do you feel also about DHS step up enforcement of immigration?  ,2,74.0,15.0,host,76.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
85,WALKER,"  No, it’s not, because if it was, it wouldn’t be limited to those countries.  It’s very much aligned with where there’s a safety concern.  You know, under President Obama, all of us governors, and he (ph) actually set it up --",2,227.0,42.0,guest,77.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
86,WALLACE,  You’ve got the DHS saying the country of citizenship doesn’t -- the citizenship country doesn’t -- it’s not a reliable indicator of terrorism.  ,2,146.0,25.0,host,78.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
87,WALKER,"  But all of the governors who were when President Obama was in place when they started bringing in refugees en masse from Syria, got on a call with the head of then Department of Homeland Security, and we’re very concerned, even including many Democrats, saying what kind of certainty do we have to know, particularly after in light of what’s happened in Europe, that there’s been a good system of vetting and understanding who’s coming into our respective states?  That’s what we’re asking for.   Now, do they need to modify it, adjust it (ph)?  Possibly.  But going forward, if the objective is to make sure that safety is paramount, and that’s really what we’re all about.  At the local, state and federal level, more than anything else, we are responsible to our citizenship for the safety of our fellow citizens.  That's what it should be about.   It shouldn’t be about religion, it shouldn’t be about anything else.  It should ultimately be about safety.  ",2,963.0,167.0,guest,79.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
88,WALLACE,"  Governor McAuliffe, firs of all, is this travel order -- is it about religion?  And secondly, your thoughts about stepped up deportations?  ",2,142.0,24.0,host,80.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
89,MCAULIFFE,"  Well, it’s very disconcerting.  People think it’s about religion and they think it’s about geography.  And that’s very damaging to our economy.   I go back -- this is not helping us create jobs.  I was out of Dulles Airport within 12 hours --",2,244.0,45.0,guest,81.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26

91,MCAULIFFE,"  Chris, let's be clear.  Everybody is about protecting the country.  We have a very rigorous program, the United States of America, to check two year process on refugees, and other related visits.   Let's be clear.  We’re all in agreement.  We want to keep our country safe.  But there is a very fine line.   I went to Dulles Airport, I was probably the first selected official out-of-the-box, because I was tipped off.  There was a family there, detained for hours.  Two children, U.S. passports, no access to legal counsel.   So, I went and I said, ""I’m the governor.  This airport is in my state, I want to know why they are being detained."" I’m very concerned and I’m meeting with General Kelly in the next hour to talk about how this ICE enforcement is going on, because let's go back to the economy.  If we are randomly going to stop people on the streets, Chris, let me tell you, it’s going to drive people underground.  They are not going to seek health care.  They’re not going to work with law enforcement, 32.5 percent of the economy in northern Virginia, small business is by foreign owned businesses.   We are scaring people.  Discrimination breeds hatred, and we got to stop it.  Let’s work together.  Of course, we want to be safe.",2,1247.0,223.0,guest,83.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26

117,WALLACE,"  You’ve become an American commentator and we give you this fire hose to drink out of. Julie, as we’ve been discussing, there are some divides among congressional Republicans, forget about the Democrats, on issues like ObamaCare and tax reform. Do you expect the president, in his prime time speech, if not to settle those issues, to give some direction to Congressional Republicans?",4,384.0,63.0,host,99.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
118,"JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"," Well, Republican -- Republicans are certainly hoping to get some direction on a couple of key things. One, tax reform, how to pay for it. This border adjustability program that Paul Ryan's office is really pushing but Senate Republicans are opposed to, Paul Ryan's office is looking for a really clear signal from the president that he supports this. He’s been talking more warmly about it, but hasn’t given a full-throated endorsement. I think ObamaCare, though, is what Republicans and Democrats are going to be looking for some real direction on because this is one that is going to come up first ahead of tax reform on Capitol Hill. And while Republicans are fully on board with the idea of repealing ObamaCare, there are huge divisions over what a replace package would look like. And first President Trump said he wanted to see them move quickly on this. Now he says this could go into next year. And beyond outlining the couple of popular provisions of ObamaCare that he wants to keep, he really hasn’t talked in detail about what the rest of the replace package would look like, how he would look to pay for it, and what this would do to people who might lose coverage under the current program.",4,1204.0,213.0,guest,100.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26

120,PACE," Everything we’ve heard from the White House so far is that we should expect sort of a broader address. That this is going to be more his vision for the country, less a laundry list.

128,HILTON," He, Trump, is more pragmatic. And I think that that’s what he really needs to convey in this speech. I think -- I think Julie’s exactly right that he will cover a lot of ground and it will be broad. However, I think it really needs to have a focus. And the focus has to be on the issue that really got him elected. And I think that is his promise to deal with the economic crisis. The real economic crisis that is affecting around half of Americans without a job, with incomes that have fallen for the last couple of decades, people who have lost that sense of economic security and hope. That’s what he’s got to focus on. And the elements of that are pretty straightforward. Much more straightforward actually than anything on ObamaCare. It’s the tax cut, the business tax cut, and the repatriation so that money is invested here in America. And it’s the infrastructure, which we almost seem too have forgotten about. That was a big part of his campaign promise. So I think he’s got to put the focus on getting the economy moving.",4,1032.0,191.0,guest,108.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
129,WALLACE,"  We asked you for questions for the panel. And on this issue of what the president should tell Congress, we got a number like this. A tweet from VG, ""stay on topic: job creation. Taxes. Health care. Stay positive. Bring the country together. Don’t talk about critics."" And this on Facebook from Kathy Roberts, ""it would be nice if he would start to unite this divided country and start a healing process. He’s still campaigning for a job he won.""

130,"LISA BOOTHE, WASHINGTON EXAMINER CONTRIBUTOR"," I would agree with the advice. I mean I -- I do think that President Trump realizes that he’s going to be addressing a Congress and I think he does realize about the challenges that he faces, because if you look at that dynamic, particularly in the Senate, which is really what matters for President Trump in trying to move his agenda forward, there’s a lot of complexity there, both with Republicans who have already voiced objection, whether it’s over the border adjustment tax, or with even, you know, the differing opinions on how to move ObamaCare forward. And then you also have those ten vulnerable Democrats, who might also be facing primary challenges to their left. So there’s a lot of complexities that he’s going to be dealing with. So I think he recognizes that this is an opportunity for him to set the agenda, to lay it out, hopefully offering some more specifics. But I do think that we’ll see a little bit more of a positive tone than may be we -- we saw at CPAC or some of the more recent speeches that he’s given.",4,1033.0,190.0,guest,110.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26

132,"JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST"," Well, I think, obviously, with the base, demonizing the press, it seems to me to be a continuation of the campaign in which he goes after Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, even the intelligence agencies that are looking into his ties to Russia. But even as it feeds the base and their distaste for mainstream media and persuades them, listen to me, don't listen to the press and my critics, it serves as a distraction. A distraction from the fact that he has accomplished so little of the pledges that he made to his backers during the campaign. ObamaCare, tax reform, build the wall, these things haven’t happen.

The Quinnipiac poll this week showing that despite his constant attacks, saying the press is the enemy of the American people, Steve Bannon telling the press, shut up, you were wrong about the election, so just shut up and listen, guess what, the American people still trust the press and First Amendment rights more than they trust this president.",4,670.0,119.0,guest,115.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26

154,WALLACE," New DNC Chair Tom Perez laying out the Democratic Party's plans to rebuild after November’s election defeat. And we’re back with the panel. I’ve got to tell you, we spend the entire commercial arguing about Donald Trump’s agenda. I wish we had that. It was actually very, very interesting. Juan, what do you think that Perez’s victory says about the Democratic Party and their path forward in terms of dealing with Donald Trump?",5,429.0,74.0,host,131.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
155,WILLIAMS," Well, I think the election between Keith Ellison, the congressman from Minnesota, and Tom Perez, the former labor secretary, was portrayed as kind of a Bernie Sanders left backing Ellison, progressive elements, far left wing of the party, versus the Obama wing, a member -- you know, you think about Perez as the former labor secretary, but you had people, Joe Biden, President Obama and the like, lobbying to get Perez in this position. I think the key issue here that both sides agree on is you’ve got to go away from centralized Democratic Party politics and get back to building state organizations. And they agree on that. But the key elements for that is, can you raise the money, Chris? We saw in the recently released money totals, donation totals for the Republican Party, they doubled what they raised four years ago after the election in the month of December. Democrats have not released their totals yet. ACLU, Planned Parenthood, they have record numbers as we see resistance building to Trump, but not the Democratic Party. So that’s the key test that right now Perez has made Ellison his vice chair, largely symbolic as a show of unity because they’ve got to go to the donors, they’ve got to go to the base and somehow channel the opposition to Trump into something that becomes essential, which is winning elections.",5,1334.0,231.0,guest,132.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26

161,HILTON," I think the answer to that is partly yes, actually. And I think we’ve got to separate organizing per message. In think in terms of organizing, to be fair to them, I think the autopsy that is often brought up when they say, well, the Republicans, after they lost in 2012, they did an autopsy, why won’t the Democrats not an autopsy? I think when it comes to organizing, it’s kind of happened. I think Juan’s right. I think they’ve all accepted there’s been a real consensus that they need to get back to grassroots, to local and state races, select candidates differently and harness that energy that’s clearly there in terms of the resistance to the new administration and bring that into the party. They’ve all accepted that. I don't think there’s any argument about that. And I think that is something that the Republicans need to take seriously. But on --",5,859.0,154.0,guest,136.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26

163,HILTON," That’s what I was going to say. The second part, the message, I think there the news is not so good for the Democrats. I don’t think that they really understood the fact that what’s really happened in the last year or so is that working people in America have lost the sense that the Democratic Party’s there for them. That that is their voice. And Trump and Bannon have plowed into that territory saying, we are there for the American worker. And I think that the election of Perez is actually bad news on that front because it seems to me that he is more likely to pursue the more coastal agenda, if you like, in terms of focusing on identity politics and so on, rather than I think the economic message, which really ought to be the heart of their strategy in the future.",5,775.0,147.0,guest,138.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26

171,WALLACE," Lisa, some folks are comparing this to the Tea Party protests back in 2009, 2010 against Democrats when president -- or rather against Republicans when President Obama was trying to pass ObamaCare. And the question I have is, do you see the same kind of grassroots activism here? I mean do you think this is at all equivalent to what the Tea Party was doing back then?",5,369.0,68.0,host,144.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
172,BOOTHE," I mean there’s -- I think there’s certainly, you know, a lot of anger and the base is activated, and so that’s something that Republican should watch, absolutely. I mean I think the Tea Party stood for something. There were principles. I'm not sure, this seems to be more of a movement that’s standing against Trump instead of standing for something specifically. But to Steve's point, and also sort of this broader -- you know, this proxy war and sort of fight for the -- the heart and soul of the Democratic Party, the big challenge they face is to an order -- in order to enact policy changes, in order to actually move agenda forward, you have to have the numbers. And the big challenge that they face right now is the fact that there are so many Democratic seats that are up for re-election in 2018, particularly in the Senate. They have 23 seats, ten of those President Trump won, five of those President Trump won by double digits. And I think right now with the resistance that we’re seeing from the left and this activation of the Democratic base, the problems for them, are Democrats going to start seeing primary challenges to the degree that Republicans have for so long? And then what challenges do those present, particularly for those 10 Democrats who are not only looking to their rights for someone potentially more moderate or Republicans to win those red states, but also to their left and having to engage and win a primary. So I think that’s the challenge for the Democratic Party or sorting -- wading through this battle that they’re facing right now.",5,1574.0,281.0,guest,145.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
173,WALLACE," Julie, what do the officials you talk to in the Trump White House, what do they think of these emotional and well-attended protests and do they worry at all that they could be a repeat of 2010 when grassroots fervor drove Republicans in this time that in 2018 -- and, yes, there are some numbers that help them -- but that they could end up help -- helping Democrats this time?",5,378.0,72.0,host,146.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
174,PACE," It’s interesting because when you talk to Republicans in the White House versus Republicans on The Hill, I think you actually hear two slightly different stories about these protest. What I hear from officials in the White House is quite similar to what the president says publicly about these. He -- they believe that these are, to some extent, paid activist, people who are coming in from outside of these district to get on television, to try to make a scene and disrupt these town halls. But on The Hill, Republicans are more concerned, and they believe that they should not underestimate what they’re seeing there. And they give a lot of credit to people like Tom Cotton, some of these other lawmakers who are going out there, spending a lot of time answering questions from supporters and from opponents. They think that that is the model. That one of the mistakes that Democrats made during the health care town halls in 2010 was shying away from it, was not really getting in the weeds and trying to defend the policy. And they think that the way that Republicans can get ahead of this is to actually engage with these people as opposed to doing what some of the folks in the White House are doing, which is to just dismiss this as a paid protest.",5,1256.0,227.0,guest,147.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
175,WILLIAMS," I think also that part of this is, it’s not just the town halls. If you look now at the president's approval numbers, they’re in the low to mid 40s and at a very low point for a new president, first month in. So you have the town hall and you get people like Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, the Republican majority in the Senate, saying, you know, it was a change election for the White House, but it wasn’t for the Senate, and making some distance now between his fate and fortune and the Trump White House. And I think that’s troubling for the Trump White House.",5,579.0,110.0,guest,148.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26
176,BOOTHE," But -- but it’s -- but it’s also important to point out that the Associated Press just ran a story about the fact that those 10 venerable Democrats, senators, are also not holding town halls as well. And I think the big problem for Republicans right now, particularly with ObamaCare, is there is a vacuum of information in the sense that Republicans haven’t presented a clear plan. So it’s very difficult to combat some of the narratives because, you know, there’s nothing to really point to.",5,493.0,87.0,guest,149.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-26

The Wall Street Journal puts out a story that says that they have anonymous sources that say that the intelligence community is purposefully cutting out material from President Trump's briefing material that he gets everyday.

82,WALLACE,"  Let me ask you about that timeline if I might, because the acting attorney general notified the White House on January 26th about discrepancies between what Flynn had told Vice President Pence about the call and what transcripts showed Flynn had actually said.  But while the president and Steve Bannon and you all knew, the vice president didn’t find out until he read it in the paper on February 9th.  Question: why didn't you as chief of staff tell the vice president over the course of 14 days?  ",1,502.0,90.0,host,67.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
83,PRIEBUS,"  Well, look, here's what happened: Yates came in, give a heads up to the White House counsel.  White House counsel looked at the matter.  The next day or the day after, the investigation was closed and no longer going on.  Then, the issue shifted to whether something was done that was wrong.   The vice president was then looped in on the situation.  We talked to the vice president about whether or not Michael Flynn was being honest or not.  The vice president knew that there was an FBI interview.  And then, ultimately, we decided after about ten days, bring in the vice president in that we decided that he wasn’t being honest.   That is the timeline.  It happened very quickly, Chris.  ",1,694.0,125.0,guest,68.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19

91,PRIEBUS,"  Yes.  No, the answer to that is no.  And the answer to the first part of the question is number one, the issue with Admiral Harward never came up.  And we haven’t really gone down the road with General Petraeus.

108,"RUSH LIMBAUGH, HOST, ""THE RUSH LIMBAUGH SHOW""","  Thank you, Chris.  It’s great to be here.  ",2,45.0,10.0,guest,90.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
109,WALLACE,"  You say that what’s happening to Donald Trump right now is that the left-wing courts, the left-wing media, the left-wing bureaucracy are trying to, in your words, sabotage his presidency.  Sabotage?  ",2,202.0,33.0,host,91.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
110,LIMBAUGH,"  Well, actually, I do.  And I -- it’s driven by two things, actually.  The first thing that’s going on, Chris, in my view, it is preposterous to believe that the Russians had any effect on the outcome of voting in this country.  It’s absurd.  There is no evidence.  Zilch, zero, nada.   The New York Times has run two stories that are basically propaganda on this -- one in October, and one this past week.  And both stories clearly say: no evidence.  Nobody they’ve talked to has any evidence whatsoever to suggest it.   The second thing I think that’s important for people to remember -- people that voted for Donald Trump, people who support Donald Trump really, really believe that they were going to lose the country if Hillary Clinton won.  This is not an idle thought.  It’s not an exaggeration.   They really believe that the country is founded was up for grabs.  It was over if Hillary won -- if the Democrats had another four or eight years to do what they do with the judiciary and so forth.   So, those two things -- and I think that if you try to understand both of those -- not to you personally -- but the people have a much greater ability to understand Trump and his supporters if you can intellectually accept those two premises.  ",2,1250.0,230.0,guest,92.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
111,WALLACE,"  You also use a phrase which I have to say that I only heard for the first time in the last couple of weeks, ""the deep state"".  And that’s the notion that there’s an Obama shadow government embedded in the bureaucracy that is working against this new president.  I think that some folks are going to think that’s right on and some folks will think it’s awfully conspiratorial.  ",2,379.0,70.0,host,93.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
112,LIMBAUGH,"  Well, I would love to claim credit for that, but actually, I think a reporter by the name of Glenn Greenwald at ""The Intercept"" who has got a relationship with -- what’s his name?  Assange.  I think he actually coined the term.  And I think it works.   I don’t think -- who is driving this business that the Russians hacked the election?  It’s the Democrat Party.  It’s Hillary.  It’s Obama.  It’s all those people who just can’t accept --",2,441.0,81.0,guest,94.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19

114,WALLACE,"  And you think they’re behind the leaks, too?  ",2,48.0,10.0,host,95.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
115,LIMBAUGH,"  Absolutely.  Of course, they are.  They’re trying -- look, if they can’t win at the ballot box -- you know they are down 1,200 seats since 2010.  They’ve come a marginal party electorally.  All they’ve got is their embeds in the bureaucracy and the judiciary, and they are pulling out all the stops.  There’s no question.   This business that the Russians hacked the elections, this is serious, serious allegation that is impossible.  The Russians could not have had any impact whatsoever on voting.  Either how they were cast or how they were counted.   In fact, if you want to say that they did, they did their job, Hillary won the popular vote.  How could they have possibly had any -- this whole premise, and it’s been driving news coverage here ever since Trump took office and even before.  And there’s -- you don’t need any more evidence than that to suggest and to know that the left, which is run by Obama and Hillary and the hierarch of the Democrat Party is doing everything they can to undermine, sabotage, and to prevent Trump from implementing his agenda.  There’s no question about it.   I know what Trump should do.  ",2,1135.0,203.0,guest,96.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
116,WALLACE,"  Well, I’m going to get to that in a second.  But you suggest that there are some things that President Trump may be doing wrong.  For instance, you said that you’re skeptical about his idea and we heard it again from Reince Priebus, that they’re going to come up with a new executive order on the so-called ""travel ban"", and that this new one is going to pass muster with the federal courts.  You’re skeptical about that.",2,423.0,78.0,host,97.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
117,LIMBAUGH,"  Well, I don’t -- I think -- I -- not so much skeptical.  I think they’re going to do it and I think they should do it, because the judiciary, again, is pockmarked with judicial appointees that Democrat presidents have made for years and they’re in there for life.  We have seen it in the first executive order.   You know, Chris, his executive order hasn’t been ruled on.  The judge in Seattle said, well, the president said during the campaign that he wanted to ban Muslims and I think (INAUDIBLE) -- it’s irrelevant.  They’re not even using the law to try to stop the president on this. I think what the president has to do and I was happy to see it.  This rally was something that I hope he would do.  And in the rally, he really focused on domestic agenda.   Look, here's the thing: Donald Trump has nobody helping him other than the people who voted for him.  Obama had the media, Obama had the judiciary, Obama had all kinds of support.  In an Obama press conference, the difficult question: what enchants you?  I mean, Obama was never challenged seriously by the media.   Trump doesn’t have any of that.  He’s got to keep his supporters on board.  He’s got to keep them revved up.  So, the rally was great.   But the thing that will really make all of this Russia stuff and all these deep state stuff not to take hold is getting to work, implementing the repeal of Obamacare.  Getting to work and really doing tax reform, and getting to work and really shore up our borders, because that is the primary area where people voted for Trump felt that we were on the way to losing the country.   We’ve even lost the definition of immigration.  Immigration today, if you listen to the left, equals anybody who wants to come into the country should be allowed.  That’s not what immigration is.  That’s illegal immigration.  And we ought to all oppose it.   We are all in favor of immigration that determines that gets in, the quantity of people who get in, whether they assimilate or not -- nobody is opposed to that.   But immigration has been defined now as people flooding the country who are noncitizens.  And that’s called immigration, according to the culture of the left.  We’re -- we’re just ruining our opportunity to stay together as a people with common culture --   ",2,2280.0,415.0,guest,98.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
118,,(CROSSTALK),2,,,,,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
119,WALLACE,"  I want to get to this question focusing on the domestic agenda because interestingly enough, that’s something you’ve been saying.  He needs to focus on the key things that would improve people's daily lives.  There is a columnist for ""The Washington Post"" who is no conservative, and he actually wrote this week, and I don’t know whether he’s going to give you a heartburn.  He said, ""Rush Limbaugh is exactly right about how Donald Trump can fix his problems,"" namely focus -- ignore the political chatter and focus on the domestic agenda.   But I’ve got to tell you, by historical standards, by this point, Obama stimulus had already been passed.  President Trump is pretty slow on Obamacare, is pretty slow on repealing Obamacare.  Pretty slow on tax reform.  And there’s a lot of disarray inside the Republican Party on Capitol Hill.  ",2,841.0,144.0,host,99.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
120,LIMBAUGH,"  Well, now, here I have to tiptoe.  We are not talking Republicans and Democrats opposing Trump.  We’re talking about establishment versus Trump.  Trump considered to be an outsider.   The establishment doesn’t want any part of Trump.  They don’t want him to succeed.  And I would throw some Republicans in that as well.  It’s just the way that Washington works.  And this is why you think moving forward on this agenda is crucial.   You mentioned Obama stimulus, here’s the difference -- and this is what Trump supporters know -- it wasn’t a stimulus.  It was the payoff to unions, Chris.  It didn’t stimulate anything.  We don’t have a growing economy.  We don’t have jobs being created -- at a replacement level for those we have lost.   We don’t have anything Obama said.  He lied about --  ",2,796.0,140.0,guest,100.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19

127,LIMBAUGH,"  Well, it is television.  It’s Fox News.  I have deep respect.   But, no, seriously.  You have the first African-American president.  You have everybody falling all over themselves to acknowledge that, to reward that.  Obama was going to get everything he wanted in the first year because if anybody opposed it, they were going to be accused of being racist, or bigot, or who knows what.   But don’t ignore the substance.  The voters know that his stimulus -- it doesn’t matter when it got passed, he misled everybody about it.  The people of this country are tired of being misled.  They’re tired of voting based on what candidates have told them they’re going to do and nothing ever changes.   Trump has a wide berth here, Chris.  The media did not make Donald Trump, and they can’t destroy him.  But the media thinks, and I -- when I say media, let me defined, ABC, CBS, NBC, New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, L.A. Times, the cadre.   They have a formula.  They have a blueprint for destroying Republican political officials they don’t like.  It’s not going to work on Trump.  He doesn’t fit that mold.  They are trying to every day.  It’s kind of comical to watch.   And my point about the domestic agenda --",2,1223.0,219.0,guest,105.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19

129,WALLACE,"  Wait, wait, I’m not interrupting because we agree, I’m just moving you along.  I want to stay on this media issue, because you heard my conversation just now with Reince Priebus, and tell me what to think.  When Trump sends out a tweet and says ""the fake media,"" and all those organizations you just listed ""are not my enemy, they’re the enemy of the American people,"" does that go too far?  ",2,394.0,73.0,host,106.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19

132,LIMBAUGH,"  I think that there’s something to it.  Enemy of the people, enemy of the state, they are enemies of Trump.  And Trump won the election.   Trump won -- on substance, Trumpet did more interviews.  He explained his agenda more than any political presidential candidate ever has in my memory.  And he has tried to stick to it as people perceive it.   And this effort to stop him -- this is what people include, anti-American, anti-this -- it clearly is anti-Trump.  And Trump has a connection with his voters that most politicians don’t have.  I understand perhaps better than anybody in media.  And that connection that he has is not anything that anybody else can break.  Only he can break it.  ",2,695.0,124.0,guest,109.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19

136,LIMBAUGH,"  My in-person (ph) -- well, it depends who you ask. If you ask the media, they want people to believe that it’s chaotic and falling apart and it’s already over. Trump’s defeated. He doesn’t know what he’s doing. And -- and everybody’s running away from it. And we’ve got people in the deep state or whatever trying to sabotage Trump in order to save America. I think he’s doing exactly what he said he was going to do. And I -- and the bottom line, I don’t really think he’s fazed by all of this. I know Donald Trump. He’s a winner. He’s committed. And he has intended all along to do what he think is necessary to save the country. So perceptions are what they are. Keep an open mind. We’re only one month in and he’s got three years and -- and 11 months to go. And I -- his supporters have nowhere near gotten to the point where they’re worried or want to abandon him. They hope he hangs in. They hope he just continues to stick it to them. And they want to see this agenda move. And, believe me, that’s the magic here. Get tax reform, Obamacare repealed, and he’s -- he’s -- he’s free.",2,1089.0,211.0,guest,113.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19

GOP strategist Karl Rove, Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service, Charles Lane of The Washington Post, and Kimberley Strassel from The Wall Street Journal. So, Karl, which better describes Donald Trump’s first month in office, chaos or a fine tuned machine?",3,439.0,72.0,host,118.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
145,"KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," I would lean more towards the former than the latter. But let’s give him credit, on substance, off to a strong start. A cabinet that’s turning out to be impressive. Moving ahead with some regulatory changes to Obamacare. Republicans on The Hill beginning to wrangle over what legislation to repeal it. Tax reform, again, wrangling, moving it forward.",3,351.0,59.0,guest,119.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
146,WALLACE,  So why chaos?,3,15.0,4.0,host,120.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
147,ROVE," Well, because the process. We saw that in the immigration executive order. They don’t have a process in place that is collaborative, that -- that will -- that puts cabinet secretaries with disagreements over White House policy in front of the president to make their arguments. They were rushed. They did it by using congressional staffers who didn’t tell their bosses. And as a result, they’re going to have to have a redo. But, you know, that’s the -- we’ve got to give him credit. He’s -- he’s -- he’s moving forward in a lot of ways. Spectacle, boy, off the charts. I mean early morning tweets, controversies about Meryl Streep's ability to -- to act, and then that blockbuster of a -- of a news conference. I mean he -- that -- the whole purpose of which was to allow him to vent at the media. He looked Pharaoh with a whip in hand, whipping those slaves, getting them to build the pyramids. I mean by -- he was unhappy. But what I really worry about is the narrative. And Rush touched on this.",3,1000.0,186.0,guest,121.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19

149,"MO ELLEITHEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," Yes, look, generally not good, right, and -- and I think he’s learning that he cannot govern the way he campaigned because there are other players here. He cannot just go out there and do what he wants to do, and there are other players here. But having said that, let’s remember this. He had about 46 percent of the vote, right? About 38 to 41 percent consistently, throughout the -- since the day he announced he was running for president through today are with him. They are not going to move. And Rush talked about that. They are going to stick with him. For them, he’s doing a great job. For them he’s moving with speed. He’s poking his finger in the eye of the establishment. Whether or not he actually produces doesn’t really matter because he’s the guy who’s going to keep doing that. But now you’ve got about five to eight percent of Trump persuadable voters and they’re watching this spectacle. And I'm not sure what they are seeing. They are not seeing a domestic agenda moving forward. They are not seeing a guy who is actually fighting for them when he’s mired by conflict of interest stories every single day.

Where did the honeymoon go?"" And the question, I guess, I have for Kim is, when you look at all of the -- of the damaging leaks from the intel committee, or the FBI, when you look at the kind of rock-solid obstruction from Democrats, when you look at -- at a lot of negative stories from the media, does George have a point?",3,625.0,119.0,host,124.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19

159,"CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST"," Yes, for two different reasons. Let's just look at the last time we had a -- a first term, first month. It was Barack Obama in 2009. The country was in the middle of an economic crisis that seemed to cry out for rapid action from Washington on the one hand, and on the other hand he had 60 votes in the Senate, so you really couldn’t stop him.

161,LANE," You sure got a lot -- you sure got a lot of -- you sure got a lot of resistance from the problems. But let me make my second point. Of course you’re getting resistance from all these sort of establishment agencies, if you like, because Donald Trump himself came in promising to attack them, promising to disrupt them, promising to take them down. What does he expect them to do, just stand back and let him, you know, destroy their influence and their power? Of course there’s going to be resistance. But, you know, he -- it’s not as if he avoids provocation of these people, particularly the media, as you have been pointing out. He relishes this combat. A lot of what he’s complaining about as resistance and so forth is resistance that he himself is provoking for the very political reasons that Mo is describing.

At this point in 2009, let's put it up on the screen, Congress had passed the Obama stimulus package, which Rush just told us wasn’t a stimulus, a measure enforcing equal pay, and expanding the children’s health insurance program.

171,STRASSEL," Well, right, because they’re taking their time to deliberate this. I mean you mentioned the stimulus bill. The reason that was passed so quickly is because President Obama said do this and everyone in the Democratic Congress said, great, we’ll jump, how high? There was no deliberation and it ended up not being a very good bill because no one spent a lot of time on it. And one other thing, too, I mean, whether or not you think that the Trump administration is working like clockwork, the House and the Senate have been remarkable. They have passed -- the House has passed more than 12 disapproval resolutions of various different Obama last minutes regulations. Three of those have gone through the Senate. The president has signed two of them. And Mitch McConnell, in the Senate, has been running cloture votes like you wouldn’t believe, getting -- we finally got Mitch Mulvaney confirmed this week for OMB, Scott Pruitt. So in the face of enormous Democratic intransigence, I think they’ve been accomplishing a great deal.",4,1028.0,176.0,guest,142.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19

175,LANE," Yes, well, I always say that, you know. Look, it -- it’s not so much the number of the bills, it’s the content of the bills. And it’s true that at the beginning of the Obama administration you had this very major legislation. Well, the one thing those all had in common were, they were giving things. They were spending money. They were -- you know. And what the Trump and GOP agenda is, is, let's face it, taking things away in the sense of eliminating Obamacare or, you know, overhauling the tax code. So a much more complicated operation by its nature. What that little sound bite you showed of Tom Cotton versus Paul Ryan demonstrated was that this border adjustment tax plan for corporate taxation that’s been germinating in the House was always going to be a heavy lift in the Senate. There was -- there was always a lot of push back.",4,841.0,156.0,guest,146.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
176,WALLACE,"  And -- and the border adjustment is the idea that you’re going to tax imports coming into the country, but you’re not going to tax exports, and thereby supposedly that you’re going to create more of a market for jobs here in this country.",4,240.0,45.0,host,147.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
177,LANE,"  Yes. And guess who is located in Arkansas and is dead set against that idea? That would be Walmart, which gets almost all of its -- well, not all, but a lot of its merchandise from China. And Tom Cotton, of course, represents them. And that’s the dynamic of the Senate. But I just want to make this point. At some point you would think that once the spectacle of bashing the media, and traveling around the country and holding 77 minute rambling press conferences is over, people are going to want to see something in -- in the form of concrete legislation and something from the president in terms of plan and they’re going to have to present that at some point.",4,665.0,124.0,guest,148.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19

182,WALLACE,"  Well, obviously, that wasn’t the news conference, that was the rally, but it was the same message, Karl. And I want to ask you, and -- and, you know, be honest, tell me if you think I’m overreacting about the president's tweet on Friday that the fake media is not my enemy, it’s the enemy of the American people.",4,314.0,60.0,host,151.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
183,KARL," Yes. Well, enemy of the American people. That’s a term we used for the axis powers, and the Vietcong, and al Qaeda and ISIS and the Taliban. I think it was over the top and unnecessary and -- and a furtherance of this administration's bigger problem. The bigger problem is not the fake news stories. The bigger problem is that they don’t have a narrative -- Rush touched on this -- they don’t have a narrative that -- that is based in the reason why they got elected. One-third of the American people thought the country was going in the right direction. They voted for Hillary Clinton. Two-thirds of the American people thought the country was off on the wrong track and a majority of them, a substantial majority, voted for Donald Trump. Fifty-two percent of the people in exit polls said the number one issue was the economy, 18 percent terrorism, 13 percent immigration, 13 percent for policy. They elected him because they want the economy to be stronger, to create more jobs and bigger paychecks. And to the degree that he spends his time, as he did in that Friday news conference, it was rock ‘em, sock ‘em. They had a lot of fun. He probably felt great after that. But what he missed was the opportunity to say to the American people, I’m focused on jobs, growing our economy, making your paychecks better, making your communities safer, making your future more prosperous for you and your kids. And a president has a brief period of time at the beginning of their administration to create a narrative. And I’m afraid that by focusing so much on these leaks, as unfair as they may be, and the -- but he had to be careful about unnamed sources and you ought to be careful about -- he’s the guy who, on the basis of unnamed sources said President Obama was not born in the United States and that 9/11 was an inside job. So, be careful about this. Why don't you stay focused on the things that the American people really care about and use the --the enormous abilities he got and the channels of communication to carry that message.",4,2038.0,371.0,guest,152.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19
184,WALLACE,"  We’ve only got a minute left, Mo. I’ve got to say, presidents do complain, and as I pointed out with -- with Reince Priebus, I mean, Barack Obama was pretty unappealing.

185,ELLEITHEE," Look, and I guarantee you, my friends on Hillary Clinton's campaign didn’t necessarily believe that the media was -- was in their corner during most of the campaign with the focus on her emails and -- and a lot of the challenges that she faced. So, yes, there is a natural amount of push and pull with the press. But as Karl said, I mean, using this type of language, turning people against an entire institution that are the bedrock -- that are part of the bedrock of our democracy is -- is dangerous. And this president does have an opportunity right now. He’s a master communicator. He’s able to -- to -- to drive a conversation in a narrative unlike many others. Use that to push his message. Use that to tell the people what he wants to do. He’s not doing that.",4,767.0,145.0,guest,154.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-19

18,MILLER,"  The message is, is that we are going to reinforce and strengthen our vital alliances in the Pacific region as part of our strategy to deter and prevent the increasing hostility that we have seen in recent years from the North Korean regime.  More broadly, as you know, we are inheriting a situation around the world today that is deeply troubling.  The situation in North Korea, the situation in Iraq, the situation in Syria, the situation in Yemen, and this president is committed to a fundamental rebuilding of the armed forces of the United States that will again send a signal to the world that America's strength will not be tested.  ",1,641.0,113.0,guest,15.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-12

20,MILLER,"  Right now, we are considering and pursuing all options.  Those options include seeking an emergency stay with the Supreme Court, continuing the appeal with the panel, having an emergency hearing en banc, or going to the trial court in the district level and a trial on the merits.  They also include, as you mentioned, the possibility of new executive actions designed to prevent terrorist infiltration of our country.   But I want to say something very clearly, and this is going to be very disappointing to the people protesting the president and the people in Congress like Senator Schumer who have attacked the president for his lawful and necessary action.  The president's powers here are beyond question.  The president has the authority under the INA Section 8 U.S.C. 1182F to suspend the entry of aliens into this country.   And he has Article 2 foreign powers to also engage in conducting border control and immigration control into this country.  Those powers are substantial.  They present the very apex of presidential authority.  And so, we are contemplating new and additional actions to ensure that our immigration system does not become a vehicle for admitting people into our country who are hostile to this nation and its values.  ",1,1252.0,208.0,guest,17.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-12

120,WALLACE,"  President Trump appearing to preview a two track approach with a new executive action, while at the same time defending his current travel ban in the courts and what he calls his continuing effort to keep the country safe. And it’s time now for our Sunday group. Michael Needham, head of the conservative think tank Heritage Action for America, Fox News political analyst and columnist for ""The Hill"" Juan Williams, Julie Pace who covers the White House for the Associated Press, and Laura Ingraham, editor of Lifezette and a Fox News political analyst. Laura, what do you expect from the president this week? Do you think that because Stephen Miller didn’t tell us that he will issue a new executive order addressing some of the legal concerns raised by the courts?",3,768.0,132.0,host,101.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-12
121,"LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST"," The Ninth Circuit made a complete legal mismatch of the doctrine of standing, of hinting that there’s a due process right of individuals outside the country who are not American citizens to enter the country. That having been said, the rollout of this executive order was not the finest hour for the administration. I believe they’re going to withdraw the order. They will write in more narrowly tailored order that will probably allay the concerns of most -- although some of the language of the Ninth Circuit opinion, it might not even be enough for them, but they’ll lose standing to continue the case. That case will probably go moot. I would be very surprised if they wanted to take a gamble going back to the district court, then going again to the Ninth Circuit, then going again to the Supreme Court. This has been a major distraction for the administration. If I were -- if I were operating coms over there, I’d have a bit of a different approach. You’ve got to repeal and replace Obamacare. You’ve got to do tax reform. You’ve got to do the things that you talked about. There’s some wisdom in what they’re saying here, but the way this was rolled out, I know everybody’s going to say, we vetted it all the right way. When John Kelly at Homeland Security says he wishes that, you know, we had done it a little differently, in my view that’s a tell. It’s OK. They can redo this. But they have to learn that it’s a -- you know, running full boar into a -- into a buzz saw of the Democratic resistance in the Ninth Circuit is probably going to distracted you for a while.",3,1579.0,291.0,guest,102.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-12

This controversy over the travel ban has obviously enough -- you can just see from this show and all the coverage this week -- an enormous amount of time and energy when, as Laura points out, there’s a big agenda out there.

If you talk to Trump supporters, people who voted for him, yes, they believe that this is part of what he promised he would do, but they are more focused on Obamacare. They are more focused on jobs and the economy. And Trump knows that.

You did a segment at the end with Stephen Miller about President Trump and some of his tweets. Let's talk about the left. Ivanka Trump went to an exercise class in Washington, D.C., earlier this week, didn’t make a big deal of it, was just quietly trying to go and enjoy herself and the CEO of that exercise group decides she’s going to go on Facebook and grandstand about how much she didn’t want Ivanka Trump there. Ivanka Trump is trying to fly across the country with her family and left wing people -- a senior member of the Trump White House was in -- in a shopping store getting dresses with her bridesmaids and was attacked in the shopping store. There’s a complete breakdown. Look, nobody’s asking Chuck Schumer, hey, do you have the courage to stand up to these crazy people on -- on the left who are -- who are uncivilly and just unreasonably attacking people? Nobody’s asking Nancy Pelosi these questions.

They complain that, oh, she doesn’t know anything about public schools. She hates public schools. She’s going to kill all public schools. They put all that caricature out. Then she goes to a public school and the most vicious, horrible things said about her, preventing her from actually entering the school at some point. So I think there’s a good point to be made that the resistance movement that has been fueled and fomented by many in Congress who are encouraging it, even former President Obama is heartened by all the enthusiasm. Enthusiasm, protest, fine. What we’ve been seeing at Berkeley, and even at this DeVos thing, which I think frankly gets scary, is that there’s -- there’s a push to bring this to this powder keg moment where at some point force will have to be used to keep people safe.

And, Mr. Vice President, I want to start with that court order temporarily blocking the president’s ban on travel.  Federal Judge James Robart says the ban does, quote, ""irreparable injury in areas of employment, education, business, family relations and the freedom to travel."" Question: Is there a danger to the U.S. now that these immigrants and refugees are again allowed to travel to the U.S.?  And what do you think about the federal appeals court’s decision not to reinstate the travel ban?",1,1226.0,210.0,host,10.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
12,"MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES","  Well, first off, from the very outset of his campaign for the president and the outset of this administration, President Trump has made it clear that he is going to put the safety and security of the American people first.  And the executive order that he signed suspending travel from countries that have been compromised by terror is consistent with that objective, and also, Chris, it’s consistent with his powers as president of the United States of America, both under the Constitution and under statutory law.   It’s quite clear that the president has the ability to determine who has access to this country when it comes to national security.   So, we believe the judge made --",1,686.0,119.0,guest,11.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
13,WALLACE,"  But, sir, a federal court of appeals --",1,41.0,9.0,host,12.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
14,PENCE,"  We believe the judge made the wrong decision, the Boston court made the right decision.  We’re going to continue to use all legal means at our disposal to stay that order and move forward to take the steps necessary to protect our country.  ",1,243.0,45.0,guest,13.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
15,WALLACE,"  But the federal court of appeals didn’t seem persuaded by that, and a judge of the case says that there is not a pressing safety issue.  He notes the fact that there hasn’t been a single terrorist act committed by anybody from any of the southern countries on the travel ban since 9/11.  Not one.  Neither the lower court nor the appeals court seem to be persuaded, sir.  ",1,374.0,70.0,host,14.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
16,PENCE,"  Well, I think that's why the judge's decision in the Washington court is so frustrating.  And, of course, it’s different from the judge’s decision at the district level in a Boston court.   But we don’t appoint judges to our district courts to conduct foreign policy or to make decisions about the national security.  Under statutory law and under the Constitution, that authority belongs to the president of the United States.  And while the court did not impose a stay of that order at this point, we’re going to move very quickly into the merits of this argument.  And as the president said, we are going to win the arguments because we’re going to take the steps necessary to protect the country, which the president of the United States has the authority to do.  ",1,770.0,136.0,guest,15.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05

22,PENCE,"  Well, as the president said this week in the Roosevelt Room, Chris, all options are on the table.  The Iranians will do well to look at the calendar and recognize that we’ve got a new president in the Oval Office.  That disastrous nuclear deal that the last administration entered into with Iran, as General Flynn said, should have encouraged better behavior by the Iranians.  But instead, what we see, whether it’d be, they’re flouting U.N. Security Council resolutions, banning ballistic missile test or whether it’d be the way they’re arming of Houthis in Yemen who just last week attacked a Saudi Arabian ship.   What we’re seeing here is hostile action, belligerent action being supported by or taken by the Iranians.  And we’re just not going to put up with it anymore.  ",1,779.0,134.0,guest,19.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
23,WALLACE,"  The president issued other orders this week, basically saying that he is going to revisit the Dodd-Frank regulations on the financial sector that were enacted after the 2008 crisis.  Isn't this president sending a message to Wall Street that he is going to back off?  ",1,270.0,47.0,host,20.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
24,PENCE,"  No, the message that we’re sending to Main Street is that we’re going to pull back this mountain of red tape that is stifling access to capital loans particularly for small businesses across this country and we’re going to get this economy moving again.  I’ve to tell you, both on the campaign trail with the president, and since the outset of the administration, in meetings with business leaders and labor leaders, they tell us that in addition to cutting taxes, that rolling back the avalanche of red tape that’s stifling this economy, and, frankly, stifling the availability of loans and financial resources for companies is a paramount importance.   And the action that the president took this week surrounded by leaders in Congress who have been working to reform, if not repeal Dodd-Frank is just the beginning of that effort, and we’re going to continue to work hard while we protect consumers along the way.  We’re going to continue to work hard to advance that kind of regulatory reform that will make resources and loans available for a growing America.  ",1,1068.0,182.0,guest,21.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
25,WALLACE,"  But, Mr. Vice President, the market spoke on Friday.  The price of Wall Street firms, their stocks rose sharply.  And the fact is that two of the key players in revisiting the rules are going to be Steven Mnuchin, the treasury's secretary, and White House advisor Gary Cohn, and they are both former top executives at Goldman Sachs.  That sure sounds like you’re aiming at Wall Street, not Main Street.  ",1,406.0,72.0,host,22.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
26,PENCE,"  Well, but -- and, you know, I understand that.  And we are proud to have both of those men involved in this administration to bring their expertise.   But, look, the reality is that you can talk to small business owners across this country and since the passage of Dodd-Frank, frankly, we’ve seen the availability of loans in banks across the country began to dry up small businesses.  Simply, the cost of compliance for smaller loans is too heavy in the wake of Dodd-Frank.  That’s what we’re hearing from Main Street.",1,521.0,92.0,guest,23.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05

34,PENCE," You know, over the course of the campaign, President Trump made it clear that he was going to appoint for the vacancy on the Supreme Court a jurist in the tradition of the late and great justice, Antonin Scalia, and in Judge Neil Gorsuch, he’s done that.   This is someone who is extraordinarily qualified.  His academic background is remarkable from Columbia, to Harvard, to Oxford.  He literally was ten years ago, Chris, confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate and we’re very encouraged at this point that more than a half a dozen Democrats have committed themselves to an upward look on the floor of the Senate.   Neil Gorsuch belongs on the United States Supreme Court.  But no associate justice to the Supreme Court in American history has ever faced a successful filibuster and Neil Gorsuch should not be the first.  So, that’s why the president and I both made it clear we’re going to work with Senate leadership in one way or another, Judge Gorsuch is going to get an upward vote on the floor of the Senate and we’re confident that he’ll be confirmed as the new associate justice to the Supreme Court.  ",1,1123.0,199.0,guest,29.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
35,WALLACE,"  I want to pick up on that, because after President Trump sent out one of the tweets dismissing the judge in the immigration ban case as a, quote, ""so-called judge"".  The Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer said that that just shows whether it should be extra scrutiny of Gorsuch, because there is a need for an independent judge to stand up against the president who is talking about so-called judges.  ",1,408.0,72.0,host,30.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
36,PENCE,"  Well, I think it just shows frankly, I just think it shows how Senator Schumer is going to reach to anything to try and continue to obstruct the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.  But that’s nothing new.  I mean, I’ve got to be honest with you, it’s really been surprising to me since the advent of this administration to see the obstruction by Senator Schumer and Senate Democrats of one cabinet nominee after another.   I’m going to be called on next week for the first time in American history as vice president to cast the deciding tie-breaking vote for a cabinet nominee.  Chris, that’s never happen in the history of this country.  But I think it shows obstruction by the Democrats in the Senate.   And the American people are tired of it.  They want to see the Supreme Court have a new justice.  ",1,821.0,150.0,guest,31.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05

45,WALLACE,"  A look at the field here at NRG Stadium, home of the Houston Texans, and tonight, site of the Super Bowl 51 on FOX.   First, back to politics.  Joining me from Washington, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will hold confirmation hearings on Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch.   Senator, you just heard Vice President Pence’s reaction to the judge's order on that immigration travel ban.  And also, his reaction to the fact that the federal appeals court out in California refused to overturn it.   Here's what President Trump tweeted yesterday, ""What is our country coming to when a judge can hold a homeland security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into the U.S."" You say the president’s travel ban is unconstitutional.  On what grounds, Senator?  ",2,835.0,141.0,host,39.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
46,"SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, D-CALI., JUDICIARY CMTE RANKING MEMBER","  Well, I’m not claiming it’s unconstitutional.  That’s not my judge.  I’m a legislator.   We have -- you know this, Chris, we have three branches of government.  They are equal.  The federal court has a right to make a judgment whether a law or an order is lawful and constitutional.  And that process has begun.  As a matter of fact, I believe there are some 60 filings on various things that the president has done thus far.   So, this is not something that is unusual, that is out of scope.  It’s very much within the scope of the three branches of our government -- the executive, the legislative, and a judicial providing oversight.  ",2,640.0,116.0,guest,40.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
47,WALLACE,"  But the presidents -- presidents generally, Senator, has wide discretion when it comes to immigration, and this White House says that there is no religious test here that yes, they are banning people from seven largely Muslim countries, but there’s no test on what religion the person has.  Everybody from those countries is being banned.  ",2,342.0,57.0,host,41.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
48,FEINSTEIN,"  Well, you know, we listen for months while Republicans said that Obama was issuing too many executive orders and exceeding his authority on executive orders.  So, you know, what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  And I think there is great concern, there has been a blizzard of executive orders and memoranda, some vague, some specific, some most probably unlawful.  And you’ve got people in the streets here.   This president has not brought the nation together as he says he is working for his base.  Well, there are a majority of people that are outside of that base.  And I think -- you know, my best advice has been, and I was able to say this to him directly: Please, Mr. President, you have to bring this country together.   What he’s doing is splitting it apart more and more and more.  ",2,810.0,148.0,guest,42.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
49,WALLACE,"  But, wait, Senator, wait a minute.  I mean, you remember the Tea Party rallies in 2010 when people were very upset with President Obama's actions, especially on Obamacare.  I didn’t hear you or any Democrats saying, maybe you should slow down, President Obama.  You’ve got to bring the country together.  ",2,307.0,52.0,host,43.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
50,FEINSTEIN,"  Well, we’re talking about ten -- no, six executive orders and ten memoranda that have been put out.  This is not one thing.  This is one they call ""shock and awe"", and there’s every right for somebody to go to a court and see if ""shock and awe"" is in essence lawful and constitutional.   The president is not a dictator, Chris. He is the chief executive of our country.  And there is a tension between the branches of government -- specifically the framers of our Constitution wanted a strong Congress for the very reason that most of these kinds of things should be done within the scope of lawmaking.   This is done within the scope of executive power.  And the challenge to executive power I think can be made is appropriate to be made when you think that it’s exceeded.  And there are people, in terms of particularly the Muslim ban aspect of this, that believe that the president’s executive power has been exceeded.  So, we’ll see.   The court memoranda -- excuse me, response has to be made through the courts by tomorrow.  It will go to the Ninth Circuit.  It will be reviewed.  I have no doubt that it will go to the Supreme Court, and probably some judgments will be made whether this president has exceed his authority or not.  ",2,1241.0,227.0,guest,44.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
51,WALLACE,"  Let's turn to Iran, because President Obama repeatedly ignored aggressive actions after the Iran nuclear deal.  Whether it was testing of ballistic missiles, whether it was Iran’s support for terror, isn’t President Trump right to say enough is enough, and to put the rulers in Iran on notice?  ",2,297.0,50.0,host,45.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
52,FEINSTEIN,"  Well, I think he is right in this.  I think Iran is wrong in this.   Let me be very clear: these are not nuclear ballistic missiles.  They are not -- conventional ballistic missiles.  But Iran has a lot of them, more than anybody else in that area.   And the need to test right now I think is very dangerous and should not have happened.  Iran also has an election coming up this year, the first part of the year.  And how much of this is political, I can’t tell.  Is it a mistake?  Is it wrong?  Yes.   Now, the president taken action with some sanctions and we’ll have to see if they have an effect.  They are limited in their nature.  But as you know, the national security advisor has said rather clearly that Iran is on notice.   I hope there is no more than this.  It is not going to benefit anyone for this kind of thing to continue.  ",2,844.0,166.0,guest,46.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
53,WALLACE,"  Senator, you’re the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which, of course, be holding the confirmation hearings on Judge Neil Gorsuch nomination to the Supreme Court.  In fact, you’re going to be meeting with him tomorrow.   And I want to ask you about Judge Gorsuch from what you’ve seen so far.  I should point out that back in 2006, on a voice vote, you are one of the people who approved his confirmation to be an appeals court judge.  ",2,453.0,83.0,host,47.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
54,FEINSTEIN,  Correct.,2,10.0,2.0,guest,48.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
55,WALLACE,"  But one of the questions is whether or not, even if he is more conservative than you, is he in the mainstream of judicial thoughts?  I want to put up a quote from Neal Katyal, who is the former active solicitor general for President Obama.  In it he says, ""I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help to restore confidence in the rule of law."" He says that Gorsuch, again, may be more conservative, but he has a solid mainstream judicial pick.  ",2,463.0,87.0,host,49.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
56,FEINSTEIN,"  Well, at this stage, I can’t comment.   Let me tell you where we are at this stage -- Friday evening, the questions went out from the committee to the nominee.  I view the minority party’s challenge to do a full and fair hearing, and to have the time to garner the facts to really understand the history of this nominee.  And we will do that.  And I believe the chairman has given us the time to do this, and also believes that the hearing should be full and fair.   If it’s a product of this hearing, we make the decision that he is not in the mainstream of judicial thought, that there are some positions he holds which are, in fact, egregious -- I do not know that at this time -- then it’s a different story.  But I want the Democratic side to start out from a neutral base and really do the proper exploratory work and then be able to hold full and fair hearings.  And we will do that.  ",2,894.0,176.0,guest,50.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
57,WALLACE,  But --  ,2,10.0,4.0,host,51.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
58,FEINSTEIN,"  And then, it’s fair.  I will make a conclusion.  And I’ll be happy to share it with you.  ",2,92.0,20.0,guest,52.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
59,WALLACE,"  But, Senator, I want to ask.  We have less than a minute left here.  There is a lot of talk about a filibuster.  Only one Supreme Court nomination has ever been filibustered in the country, would you even consider doing that at this time and risking that Republicans will then extend the nuclear option and say that he can be confirmed with 51 votes, and not a super majority of 60 votes?  ",2,392.0,74.0,host,53.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
60,FEINSTEIN,"  Well, the filibuster is essentially requiring 60 votes on cloture.  I believe that’s the way it’s looked at in this.  And I have no idea whether there are 60 votes now.  And this is the one judicial appointment that does have that criteria, as you know.  You know, looking back --",2,282.0,52.0,guest,54.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05

100,WALLACE," I want to ask you about that because what I really wanted to talk to you about is how you have developed a culture of excellence in this team. Six straight AFC championships. Now, obviously, it makes it a little bit easier to have Bill Belichick as your coach and Tom Brady as your quarterback, but in a league with a hard salary cap and a level playing field and changing players every year, personnel, how have you done it?  How have you kept this team winning for, what, a decade-and-a-half?",4,495.0,92.0,host,84.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05
101,KRAFT," Well, the key to life, you know, is collecting good people, and then trying to have a sense of continuity and stability. And you're in the media business. We're in the media business. You know how personalities, their egos can get out of control. And especially when you win in this league, everybody thinks they're the reason that it happens. So I think management's job is to really try to keep everything together and have everyone check their ego at the front door. You know, we've been able to have Tommy and Bill for 17 years and have a lot of people pass through at that same time. And different controversies come up, but we keep the task at hand. And probably the most important thing, besides setting a certain culture when we bought the team, is making sure that everyone understands that there’s no division from within.",4,833.0,149.0,guest,85.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05

There can be bounces of the ball that happen no matter how well you plan and how well you do things. And it’s all about putting team first. And, you know, I went out to practice and I was talking to one of our players, who's an outstanding player. His role might be to be a decoy the whole game. He won't be on national television doing the glory things. But he really believes if that -- if that helps our team win, in the end, that's the best thing for him.",4,603.0,120.0,guest,87.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-02-05

105,KRAFT," Yes. I think that's a very good question. You know, I think, first of all, the election the first half of the year made a big difference. And we had some compelling entertainment going on that got tremendous ratings. And I'm not sure that isn't still going on, but the debates and what have you -- our ratings picked up the second half. I think all of television, the ratings are down in all product areas. I think we are less than most. And I think we have a real challenge in the future of how we present our game to young people.

107,KRAFT," Yes, I think part of it is, we have so many breaks during a quarter, and maybe we reduce them by 20 percent. And we have to make sure our partners are still doing well. And I think we have to figure out how we incorporate over the top in a way that meets millennials, the whole trend towards watching on mobile devices. I think only music and the sports can bring a community together. And, you know, I take pride seeing New England Patriot fans throughout America and throughout the world really who come to us and they feel a connection. It’s like a sense of family.

13,WALLACE,"  And hello again from Fox News in Washington.   Donald Trump's first week in office is ending in controversy and widespread protest.  Federal judges have now stepped in to temporarily blocked part of Mr. Trump’s ban on people coming to the U.S. from certain largely Muslim nations.  Some of the travelers caught in the ban were about to be deported back to their home countries.   In a moment, we’ll have a Sunday exclusive when we sit down with counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway.   But first, let's bring in FOX News correspondent Rich Edson reporting from the White House on a president who is charging full ahead -- Rich.  ",1,638.0,113.0,host,12.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
14,"RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT","  Good morning, Chris. And the Trump White House is defending its executive order halting immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries, this as a judge has blocked the deportation of those detained in airports as a result of that order.  The ruling falls short of letting those immigrants into the country.  And in response to the ruling, the department of homeland security says in a statement, quote, ""The president’s executive order remains in place.  Prohibited travel will remain prohibited and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety.""   And at the White House, President Trump is responding to that criticism.  ",1,706.0,114.0,guest,13.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29

The president also continues conversations with foreign leaders.  He's already spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The White House said the two discussed, quote, ""topics from mutual cooperation in defeating ISIS, to efforts in working together to achieve more peace throughout the world, including Syria."" He’s also scheduled to speak with foreign leaders from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and South Korea.  And as week two of the Trump White House begins, we also expect to hear who President Trump will choose to fill the Supreme Court vacancy.  That's expected Thursday -- Chris.  ",1,787.0,127.0,guest,15.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29

21,WALLACE,"  So, we just heard President Trump say it's all working out very nicely.  But in fact, as we've seen, there are protests across the country, and now, federal judges have stepped in to at least temporarily block deportation of people who had come in who are banned from coming in under his order.  Shouldn't that have been worked out before this order went into effect?  ",1,371.0,67.0,host,18.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
22,CONWAY,"  The judge in Brooklyn, the Obama appointee judge in Brooklyn’s stay order really doesn't affect the executive order at all, because the executive order is meant to be prospective, it’s preventing, not detaining.   And so, you’re talking about 325,000 people from overseas came into this country just yesterday through our airports.  So, 325,000, you’re talking about 300 and some who have been detained or are prevented from gaining access to an aircraft in their home country.  They must stay for now.  That's 1 percent.   And I think in terms of the upside being greater protection of our borders, of our people, it's a small price to pay.  And I am told by the officials that anyone who is being detained, if there’s no further threat, if they’re not dangerous to this country, they can expect to be released in due course, as most of them have already.  ",1,860.0,151.0,guest,19.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29

35,CONWAY,"  Well, hold on.  In 2015, Chris, Congress passed the Terrorist Prevention Act.  And what it essentially did was it identified the seven countries and expanded the list from four, and identifying them as a threat.  These are countries that have a history of training, harboring, exporting terrorists. And one thing that is very important to recognize whether you are -- the Orlando shooter, yes, he was born here, but he went abroad, was radicalized in the Internet.  If you are San Bernardino, if you are the Tsarnaev brothers in Boston, these are people who traveled abroad, were radicalized, were trained, and then they came back and did their bloody (ph) massacre here on American soil.  It's no different really than what's happened all across the U.S. And so, we can't just keep on looking the other way and pretending that there aren’t people out there, there isn’t a terrorist organization, ISIS, al Qaeda, otherwise, who wants to --  ",1,943.0,160.0,guest,29.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29

110,CONWAY,"  I think it’s called listen more.   And let me just say something else happens.  It's the way that everything is cherry picked.  Bias media coverage it's easy to detect.  It frankly helps us because this was such an elite rejection of election, where the establishment, the elites were all rejected by the voters. It turns out they’re a heck of a lot more of them than us, Chris.  And that’s how we won.  Why is that relevant?  It’s relevant because people -- who is cleaning house?  Which one of the first network to get rid of these people who said things that just weren’t true.   Talk about fake news, talk about alternative facts, what happened last week?  I went on three network Sunday shows.  I spoke for 35 minutes on three network Sunday shows.  You know what got picked?  The fact that I said alternative facts, not the fact that I ripped a new one to some of those hosts for never covering the facts that matter to America’s women, 16.1 million women in poverty as we sit there, the 12.4 million who have no health insurance.  Everybody should feel outraged.   The billions of dollars we have spent as a nation on public education, only to have millions of kids trapped in schools that fail them and never really promote and protect their intelligence and prepare them for the world that they all deserve.  They shouldn't be restricted by the zip code where they live.  They should be lifted up.   This has all been a colossus failure, and nobody wants to talk about that.  They want to talk about it’s always zing.  It’s always playing gotcha. There's no question that when you look at the contributions made by the media, money contributions, they went to Hillary Clinton.  We have all the headlines, people should be embarrassed.  Not one network person has been let go.  Not one silly political analyst and pundit who talked smack all day long about Donald Trump has been let go.  They are on panels every Sunday.  They’re on cable news every day.   Who’s the first editorial -- the first blogger that will be left out that embarrassed his or her outlet?  We know all their names.  I’m too polite to call them by name.  But they know who they are, and they’re all wondering, will I be the first to go? The election was three months ago.  None of them have been let go.  If this were a real business, if the mainstream media were a thriving private sector business that actually turn a profit, which is not true of many of our newspapers, Chris, 20 percent of the people would be gone.  They embarrassed, they failed to protect their shareholders and their board members and their colleagues. And yet we deal with him every single day.  We turn the other cheek.  If you are part of team Trump, you walk around with these gaping, seeping wounds every single day, and that's fine.  I believe in a full and fair press.   I’m here every Sunday morning.  I haven't slept in a month.  I believe in a full and fair press.  But with the free press comes responsibility.  And responsibility is to get the story right.  Biased coverage is easy to detect.  Incomplete coverage impossible to detect.  That’s my major grievance, is the media are not -- they’re not giving us complete coverage.   President Trump has signed all these executive orders this week.  He's met with these heads of states.  He's done so many things to stimulate the economy, to boost wages, to create jobs.  Where's the coverage?  ",1,3410.0,610.0,guest,91.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29

126,"SEN. DICK DURBIN, D-IL., MINORITY WHIP","  Well, thank goodness that this Brooklyn federal judge has tried to stop these executive orders.   Here are three things that are wrong.  First, it was an impulsive move by the president, without follow-through to the Department of Homeland Security.  When we contacted Customs and Border Protection at the airports, they said, you know, they just sprung this on us.  And now, we’re detaining people, some of who are legal permanent residents.  So, they didn't have clear guidance from the administration about how to make this work.   Number two, going after these refugees -- these are the most carefully vetted visitors to the United States of anyone who comes to our airports, including this ban on Syrian refugees when we have had no examples, not one, of a Syrian refugee engaged in terrorism in the United States.   And the third point -- and I think this is one that's going to haunt us for a long time -- was the suggestion by the president that somehow we’re going to favor Christians, and in some cases banning Muslims in the future.  That is exactly the opposite message we need to send to our allies and to those who, frankly, want to do us harm around the world.  ",2,1179.0,210.0,guest,103.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29

144,DURBIN,"  Definitely not, and the reason is this -- eight years ago when Obama came up with his nominees for the cabinet, by January 8th, before January 20th swearing in, these nominees had filed the ethics statements they were required to file.  In this case, with the Trump nominees, even after the day of the hearing, many of our committees were not receiving the required legal documents from these nominees.   Second, among these nominees are many billionaires and people with extensive financial holdings. When Penny Pritzker was nominated for secretary of commerce under President Obama, it took six months to clear all of the ethical standards that had to be met and filings met before she could be considered. So here come the Trump nominees saying, well, we may have a lot of money and a lot of unanswered questions, but we want to be pushed forward in the front of the line.",2,877.0,154.0,guest,116.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29

170,WALLACE,"  President Trump defending his plan for what he calls extreme vetting of some people coming -- trying to come to the U.S. And it's time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist Karl Rove, Charles Lane of ""The Washington Post,"" Julie Pace, who covers the White House for the Associated Press, and Dana Perino, co-host of ""The Five."" Well, Karl, let’s start with you. What do you make of the president's order restricting people coming into this country from largely Muslim nations and the federal judges -- a couple of federal judges getting involved?",4,551.0,95.0,host,136.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
171,"KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," Yes. Well, look, he is -- he promised this during the campaign, extreme vetting. But I think people might have been surprised -- I think that -- that they might have been led to believe that rather than suspending the issuance of new visas, they didn't expect him to turn back people who already had visas, including people who had green cards, and that's how the federal judges got involved and said --",4,404.0,74.0,guest,137.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
172,WALLACE,"  No, no, we should explain that. So you’ve got a green card. You’re a permanent resident in this country. A legal resident in this country. You've gone on a trip someplace else. Now you can't get back in.",4,205.0,39.0,host,138.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
173,ROVE," Or you have received a visa approved by the United States government in the recent past and you got on an airplane and showed up at the airport and suddenly that visa, which had been given to you by the United States government is no longer (INAUDIBLE) and valid.",4,264.0,50.0,guest,139.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
174,WALLACE,"  So -- so Donald Trump would say, too bad.",4,43.0,10.0,host,140.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
175,ROVE," Yes, too bad. Well -- but a federal judge said, you could cause irreparable harm. In fact, one of the first people who had such a visa, who stopped at the New York airport, as luck would have it, is somebody who worked for the U.S. government in Iraq for the last ten years. Not exactly the -- if you want to have a -- this long happy life, a good thing to do in -- in Iraq. So, you know, look, the president’s following through on his commitment, but it strikes me that it might have been better -- he -- he wants the secretary of the homeland security, the secretary of state, in the next 30 days, to come up with the information that they need and -- and those two plus the director of national intelligence, and the FBI director, in the next 60 days, to come up with a plan for extreme vetting. It might have been better to say, suspend the issuance of any new visas. Rigorously monitor people who come into the country from these seven countries who have a visa, are permanent residents who come back into the country, and then, in 90 days, we have a complete new plan that we can then begin issuing new visas.",4,1116.0,216.0,guest,141.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
176,WALLACE,"  Chuck, as we say, this is already -- already in the courts and at this point I guess he got something like 300 people who were in kind of limbo at U.S. airports. What's the fallout both politically and legally here?",4,217.0,42.0,host,142.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
177,"CHARLES LANE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," Whatever it is, it's entirely self-inflicted. This was all avoidable for the White House. They put this thing together without a full interagency process. They put it together obviously without thinking through the green card angle and all its potential ramifications. And they produced an order that sort of is -- is like a lose, lose, lose for them. It's not even the full Muslim ban he promised at one point. This is the sort of climb down position, and yet he produces something that’s over inclusive in that it brings in all the green card people and under inclusive in that it leaves out, as you pointed out earlier, a number of countries such as Pakistan or Afghanistan from whence terrorists have come. So the -- obviously there's huge uproar on the Democratic side. That was predictable. But very interestingly, I count at least three Republican senators who voiced concerns about how this thing has worked out. So it's not even entirely clear that he's going to have unified Republican support behind this thing unless they can clean it up very quickly.",4,1064.0,184.0,guest,143.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
178,WALLACE," Dana, you worked for a president who famously, and very -- in a concentrated way, made the point, we’re at war with terrorism, we’re not at war with Muslims. Do you worry that this ends up changing that message?",4,212.0,40.0,host,144.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
179,"DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR"," Well, I do think it's important to point out that it's a moratorium, not a ban, so there is time for them to be able to figure it out. So it's not like it’s a permanent thing. I also think that some of the responses today and the explanation, like from Kellyanne Conway earlier on your show, helped explain a little bit more about the decision-making process. And when they say that this was an Obama administration recommendation, I call that would have been a helpful thing to use initially. So I call that an ounce of prevention. How can you explain things more? Because what we found, and I think President Obama found it too, is that no one’s going -- you can’t get everyone to agree with a decision, but you should be able to get them to respect the decision-making process. And the -- I think the Trump administration would be well served if it explains things a little bit more on the front end to avoid confusion on the back end so that more of those stories that Kellyanne Conway was talking about, the underreporting of all the good stuff, could get more play.",4,1072.0,199.0,guest,145.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
180,WALLACE," You know, I'm -- I’m beginning to call these Trump Sundays because I prepare the show on Saturday and by Sunday morning the world has changed. And what I thought we were going to be talking about, and now what I’m going to talk about with you, Julie, is the president's phone call with Russian President Putin yesterday, which was highly anticipated. So much so that in fact President Trump had to lower expectations. Here he is.",4,430.0,78.0,host,146.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
181,,(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP),4,,,,,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
182,TRUMP," Putin and Russia, I don't say good, bad or indifferent. I don't know the gentleman. I hope we have a fantastic relationship. That’s possible. And it's also possible that we won't. We will see what happens.",4,206.0,37.0,guest,147.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
183,,(END VIDEO CLIP),4,,,,,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
184,WALLACE," Julie, have you learned anything, because they -- the White House has not been very forthcoming, at least publicly. Have you learned anything privately from sources about how the call went? And, two, this talk about conceivably lifting sanctions which Kellyanne Conway had said was under consideration.",4,303.0,48.0,host,148.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
185,"JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"," You’re right, the readout of this call was pretty brief. Not a lot of details in there.",4,88.0,18.0,guest,149.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
186,WALLACE, We actually literally got more information from the Kremlin than we did from the White House.,4,94.0,17.0,host,150.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
187,PACE," Which we often do. The Kremlin is actually quite skilled at putting out readouts, not only that are more detailed, but also that come out faster than the White House. It’s a strategy that they’re -- they’re pretty good at. I did talk to a White House official who said that sanctions did not come up in the course of this conversation. There was a lot of talk about security issues, particularly the idea of terrorism being what Putin apparently called a common foe multiple times in the course of this conversation. I think that you should look at this 30 day review that the president is doing -- has ordered the Pentagon to do on the ISIS strategies for a possible focus on coordinating more with Russia and Syria, which is something that the Obama administration resisted. But even the idea that sanctions didn't come up in this phone call doesn’t ease the anxiety that you’re seeing, not just among European leaders, but a lot of Republicans on Capitol Hill who worry that the president, when he has to make a decision very quickly on the sanctions involving Ukraine, could look to make a deal with Russia and back off of those and then also back off of the sanctions that Obama imposed for the hacking and --",4,1215.0,220.0,guest,151.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
188,WALLACE," Dana, your former boss, Bush 43, famously said that he looked in the eyes -- straight in the eyes of Vladimir Putin, got a sense of his soul. As we know, that didn't work out very well. How do you think this relationship with -- do you think Trump can somehow charm or tame Vladimir Putin?",4,290.0,57.0,host,152.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
189,PERINO," Well, I thought that Donald Trump’s probably best moment of his week was his press conference where the U.K. prime minister, Theresa May, where he talked about good, bad or indifferent, I don't know, which is actually true. So he -- he’s not sure. He says he’d like to have a good relationship. So did the Obama administration with the famous reset button. I think --",4,368.0,67.0,guest,153.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
190,WALLACE,  That didn't work out either.,4,30.0,6.0,host,154.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
191,PERINO," No. So American presidents want to have good relations with countries all over the world, and then it's really up to that president or the counterpart to -- what -- what their actions are. And I think the Ukraine issue or whether there was more interference and -- I think that also that Donald Trump will appreciate that Vladimir Putin had national interests of his own. He doesn't want to be friends with us because he’s a friendly guy. He wants something from us. And it might be something nefarious that’s not in our national interest and so he might have to back off a bit. But I think that his best moment of the week was with that -- that moment when he answered the question in that press conference with Theresa May.",4,726.0,135.0,guest,155.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
192,WALLACE," All right, we have to take a break here. When we come back, we’ll discuss the upcoming showdown over the Supreme Court.

200,WALLACE," President Trump telling Fox’s Sean Hannity he's ready to pull out all the stops to get his Supreme Court nominee this week through the Senate. And we’re back now with the panel. Well, Julie, there are three supposedly front runners. Let’s put them up on the screen. Three federal circuit court judges. Any sense as to the pecking order of those three, the likelihood, and as soon as Mr. Trump talked about the nuclear option, which would change the rules, it would mean you could -- the Senate would approve with only 51 votes instead of the super majority of 60 votes. Mitch McConnell immediately pushed back and said that the Senate's call.",5,643.0,114.0,host,161.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
201,PACE," Right. Absolutely. I -- I think if you look at the pecking order of those three judges, we’ve seen Judge Pryor maybe fall a little bit to the bottom there. He's one that when you talk to --",5,190.0,39.0,guest,162.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29

203,PACE," When you talk to Democrats and Republicans, he’s one that they worry the most about. He has an extremely conservative track record. But he's been in the mix, certainly. A lot of people who have been talking to Trump from Heritage and The Federalist have been pushing Pryor. Neil Gorsuch seems to be rising at the moment. And we were talking about this a little bit in the green room, this is actually someone that I think that Democrats might have a harder time using the filibuster against. And so certainly --",5,512.0,93.0,guest,164.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
204,CAW, Because?,5,9.0,2.0,guest,165.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
205,PACE," Because he -- he e is seen as certainly not a moderate choice, but if you look at his track record, he would be, I think, more acceptable to some people from red states than a Pryor even would. And politics comes into play enormously once you’ve made this pick. And I think given the atmosphere in Washington right now, the anger among Democrats about the way that Merrick Garland was treated, they are going to look to be really aggressive. And so anything that the Trump team can do to put someone in position to actually get approved by the Senate will help them out.",5,571.0,107.0,guest,166.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
206,WALLACE," We asked you for questions for the panel and we got a big response on this one. First of all, this on Twitter. ""What will happen if McConnell uses the nuclear option? Will there be a price?"" But on Facebook, Marilyn, speaking about what Julie was just saying, remembers Republicans blocking the nomination of Merrick Garland to the court last year. ""Dems should block any and all Trump appointees. Just like McConnell did to Obama. Or is this different now?"" Karl, it seems like this is going to be an even bigger political fight than usual.",5,542.0,97.0,host,167.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
207,ROVE," Yes. Well, it is different. For the last 80 years, no president of the United States has nominated in his final year and seen approved to the Supreme Court any nominee. It’s not happened for 80 years. So it was to be expected that Barack Obama was going to be no different than all of his predecessors. In fact, Joe Biden and -- and Chuck Schumer opposed the nomination. In Schumer's case, the approval of any Supreme Court nominee in the last year and a half and George W. Bush’s term in office. Said so from the floor. Biden announced it as the Biden rule, no approval in the last year. So this is different. But will the Democrats trying and obstruct? Absolutely. Is this going to be a bitter fight? Absolutely. At the end of the day, it comes down to two things. One is, are there enough red state Democrats who say, you know what, the person who President Trump has nominated is -- is acceptable enough to the people in my state that I’m going to pay a price if I turn into a blind obstructionist like they’re already making me on the -- on the -- on the nominees to the -- to the cabinet look like. And second of all is, if at the end of the day are there a sufficient number of them that they can keep in place the 60 rule? If not, I think Mitch McConnell, he is absolutely right to say, this is the Senate's decision. But my sense is, if the -- if Democrats harden the line and they get to 58 or 59, 52 Republicans and six or seven Democrats, but not to eight, then they might -- they might impose the nuclear option and --",5,1532.0,299.0,guest,168.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
208,WALLACE," And just to explain, it already is the case for lower court judges that -- because the Democrats changed the rules in 2013, you only need a simple majority of 51. The Supreme Court is still the super majority of 60. So a filibuster can still block it. Now the question is, will the Republicans extend that or feel forced to extend that to a -- a Republican nominee for the Supreme Court? I want to turn to another big subject, and I had a big conversation, as you saw in the first segment. The White House and the media. Here's what the president said this week.",5,563.0,108.0,host,169.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29

212,WALLACE,"  And, Dana, as I discussed with Kellyanne Conway, Steve Bannon, in an interview with the -- interestingly enough The New York Times went a lot further, keep our mouth shut, zero intelligence, zero intelligence. Does this make sense from the White House’s point of view?",5,270.0,46.0,host,171.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
213,PERINO," Well, it does, because I think that they have effectively used the media against the Democrats, right? So they were able to say to their base, we have an enemy in the media, and the base agreed, and so it helps them a little bit. But I do think that -- so Steve Bannon’s quote, it’s very quotable, and it’s pretty -- I can understand why a journalist would be offended by it. But the second part of it was, just give us a shot here. And I think what Kellyanne said about the underreporting of some of the good policies that they’re doing or the problems that they’re trying to solve. I mean I've done media relations for a long time and, as a Republican, it would be very frustrating. But the thing is also this. Human beings are always going to try to eat desert first. If you keep feeding them sugar, they’re going to go with the sugar. So if you give them something to cover that is process oriented or a tweet that seems a little off, they’ll cover it.",5,957.0,185.0,guest,172.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29

218,PACE," It took several more hours to get to the list of countries from them that this would actually impact. And then it took another full day to get an actual briefing on the details. We are desperate to cover the policies that this president is implemented. The White House, though, is not helping us do that.",5,305.0,57.0,guest,177.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
219,WALLACE," Let me bring Chuck into this. Politicians, as I just said to Kellyanne, complain about bad press all the time. Is this different?",5,130.0,24.0,host,178.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29
220,LANE," This is the president of the United States declaring the media, which by the way he's not precisely defining -- he’s, you know, well, we think we know who's he's talking about -- as the party of opposition. And the implication of that seems to be, well, I don't have to cooperate with them or work with them or respect them or treat them. But, you know, it’s -- in a democracy, the opposition is not the enemy, OK? Even if you identify someone as the opposition, you sometimes work with them. You talk to them. You compromise with them. You attempt to match what you consider there bad faith with your good faith. And so what's astonishing about the rhetoric of a Steve Bannon in all of this is, when he’s saying opposition, what he seems to mean is implacable enemy. And I think that is new. But I would just repeat that in a democracy, the opposition is not the enemy. So even if it were true that the media is there opposition that would not be a reason to freeze them out and to greet them with complete hostility.",5,1019.0,193.0,guest,179.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-29

222,PACE," It's a little bit different, but I would say that under the Obama administration they also looked at us with some disdain. They also thought that their coverage was unfair.

10,WALLACE,"  And hello again from Fox News in Washington.   Donald Trump's inaugural celebration was barely over when hundreds of thousands of women took to the streets of Washington and cities around the world to protest against the president.  Meanwhile, Mr. Trump went to the CIA to repair a rift with the intelligence community, but also attacked the news media -- an attack his press secretary Sean Spicer continued last night.   In a moment, we’ll have an exclusive interview with new White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.  But, first, let's bring in FOX News chief White House correspondent John Roberts with a continuing debate over the Trump presidency -- John.  ",1,666.0,113.0,host,9.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
11,"JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT","  Chris, good morning to you. It was quite an afternoon yesterday, and the Trump administration -- the new Trump administration showing that it is quickly going to push back hard against any press reports that are either incorrect or even not to their liking.  In his first official statement from the Brady briefing room yesterday, Press Secretary Sean Spicer ripped the press for a false report that President Trump had removed the bust of MLK from the office, and for reports that the Trump’s inauguration appeared far smaller than those of President Obama in 2009.  ",1,570.0,97.0,guest,10.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

26,WALLACE,  I want to start with Sean Spicer's extraordinary press briefing late yesterday afternoon where he excoriated reporters for their stories about the relative crowd size at the Trump inauguration and said they should instead be talking about Democratic delays to the confirmation of Trump nominees.  Here he is.,1,310.0,49.0,host,19.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

28,SPICER,"  That's what you guys should be writing and covering, that this -- instead of sowing division about tweets and false narratives.  The president is committed to unifying our country, and that was the focus of his inaugural address.  This kind of dishonesty in the media, the challenging, the bringing about our nation together, is making it more difficult.  ",1,358.0,60.0,guest,20.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

30,WALLACE,"  Then, Spicer walked out without taking a single question from reporters. Reince, President Trump said in his inaugural address said that every decision he makes will be to benefit American families.  How does arguing about crowd size do that?",1,244.0,40.0,host,21.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
31,PRIEBUS,"  Because it's really not about crowd size.  What it's about is honesty in the media.  What it's about from day one after winning this election, and President Trump talking about bringing America together, having a unified American public around unified ideas, not Republican or Democrat, he's ready to get to work.  However, the media, from day one, has been talking about delegitimizing the election, talking about the Russians, talking about everything you can imagine, except the fact that we need to move this country forward.   Now, we get done with the inauguration.  First thing out of the media is that president Trump removed the bust of Martin Luther King Jr. out of the Oval Office. This is an explosive accusation which could have had incredible ramifications, given the history of the press and on this subject matter.   It turns out, it's completely false.  I walked back into the Oval Office, saw the MLK bust to there, and what did the media say?  The media said, oh, our bad, someone was standing in front of the bust. We didn't see it.   Can you imagine tweeting that President Trump removed the MLK bust?  So, that’s the first day.  Day one.  Not even day -- I mean, day like hour three.   Then, the next day, they put a picture, big story, before the speech actually began, showing all of this white space.  It wasn't true. The New York Times then put a picture in the middle section showing the fact that the entire mall was completely full.   The point is not the crowd size, the point is that the attacks and the attempts to delegitimize this president in one day -- and we’re not going to sit around and take it.  Sean has been doing press briefings every single day.  This was a press --  ",1,1715.0,309.0,guest,22.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

34,WALLACE,"  OK, you talk about honesty and say that this was about honesty.  Well, there's another issue here, though, Reince, and that is the president's honesty, because two things that he said yesterday were just flat wrong, and I want to talk about them.   First, crowd size.  I’m going to put up, take a look at these pictures.  We’ve got monitors here.  ",1,350.0,64.0,host,25.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

66,PRIEBUS,"  Listen, someone leaked the document, some leaked the document, and you don't know if it wasn't someone in the intelligence community.  But some bad actor -- the point is this, one bad actor in the intelligence community doesn't taint President Trump's view of the entire intelligence community.  I was there yesterday.  I’m telling you, it was a love fest if you are in the room.   These are men and women that President Trump loves and respects, and the reason he went there first was to tell them I don't want you to believe the media, that I don't respect you all as intelligence officers.  ",1,596.0,107.0,guest,52.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

81,PRIEBUS,"  I think that John Brennan has a lot of things that he should answer for in regards to these leaked documents.  I find the whole thing despicable.  I think that it's unprofessional.   I think perhaps he is bitter. You know, he was replaced the day before.  He was not asked to hold over, like Clapper was.  I don't know what's in his head. But what I do know is that the president wanted to make it clear to the folks in that room, and I want to make this clear for everyone why we talked about the things we talked about, is he wants to say, look, what I went through the last two days with the MLK bust, the attack on the crowd size instead of the substance of what I was talking about, is in the same way what you’ve been hearing about me in the intelligence community, don't believe it.  I love you, I want to work with you, and we’re going to be a great team.  ",1,867.0,173.0,guest,66.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

104,PRIEBUS,"  No, he’s not.  He’s talking about a number of people, just enough of people here in Washington that block real things from getting done.   But it's not going to be that way anymore, because we have a majority in the House and the Senate.  We have a tool called reconciliation.  We can get a lot of things done on Obamacare and repeal and replace, but through reconciliation and through Tom Price, and the secretary of Health and Human Services.  We have tax reform that we finally can get through.   And working with Paul Ryan and leadership and the team that President Trump has put together, it's given us a formula to finally get big things done in this country.  ",1,669.0,123.0,guest,85.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

106,PRIEBUS,"  I think it's pretty inspiring.  I think when he walked in, it's something that's enormous, and I think the weight of that enormity was felt by him.  He’s still the same person, remarkably very consistent.   And -- but I certainly think the feeling of being president, walking in that Oval Office was something that him, obviously, but everyone, walk through their felt -- responsibility to this country and the people that put him there.  He knows it, and it's in his heart, and I can promise you, he wants to make people proud.  ",1,532.0,96.0,guest,87.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

118,MCCONNELL,  Well --  ,2,11.0,4.0,guest,96.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
119,WALLACE,"  No, but let me finish, Washington leaders who he says have done well here but have ignored millions of Americans.  How do you work with a president who seems to have such little regard and really some animosity to the Washington establishment?  ",2,247.0,44.0,host,97.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
120,MCCONNELL,"  Well, let's look at the election.  The so-called establishment in the Congress did very well.  We held the House, held the Senate.  Republicans had a very good day. And after eight years of Barack Obama, there are more elected Republicans at every level of government, that’s local, state and federal, than at any time since the 1920s.  So, I believe the president is talking about the outgoing Obama administration.   You have to have a president who will sign bills that you pass.  And the only way to change the country was to get a president who would sign the bills that will be passed by the Republican Congress that the American people continued in last November's election.  ",2,685.0,120.0,guest,98.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
121,WALLACE,"  I discussed the Trump agenda with Reince Priebus.  Have you decided in what order you are going to take things off in the Senate, and given how extraordinarily broad and ambitious this agenda is, are you worried at all about overloading the circuits?  ",2,254.0,45.0,host,99.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
122,MCCONNELL,"  Well, if you’re talking about the Senate, we have this whole area of responsibility that the House doesn't have.  There are over 1200 executive branch appointments that have to be confirmed.  So, we’re starting off here after passing the Obamacare repeal resolution, which we did before President Trump took office, trying to get his cabinet nominations in place, and subsequently, we’ll have a Supreme Court nomination as well.  So, that’s a Senate-only activity.   The broader legislative agenda, we have an actual chance of achieving, repealing and replacing ObamaCare in connection with the administration.  President Obama implemented a lot of ObamaCare himself, so President Trump will be able to undo a lot of it himself.  We also expect to be able to do comprehensive tax reform.  Under the Constitution, that will start in the House later this year.   So, yes, I think we’ll able to address almost all of what the president is emphasizing that he would like to do.  ",2,977.0,163.0,guest,100.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
123,WALLACE,"  Let's talk specifically about ObamaCare, because President Trump has said he wants to repeal and replace at the same time.  One, is that possible, given the fact that repealing is a lot easier than replacing?  And two, as you sit here today as the Senate majority leader, do you know what the Republican replacement plan is?  ",2,328.0,58.0,host,101.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
124,MCCONNELL,"  We’re working in connection with the administration to have an orderly process of repealing ObamaCare and replacing it.   So, let me talk a minute about the status quo.  What did Bill Clinton say about ObamaCare last year?  He says it's the craziest thing you've ever seen.   Eight out of 10 Americans, Chris, eight out of 10 want it entirely replaced or dramatically changed.  So, even if Hillary Clinton had won the election, we’d be revisiting ObamaCare.  The status quo is not an option.   So, we’re going to move carefully, in conjunction with the administration to repeal and replace it with things like health savings accounts and interstate health insurance sales, and high risk pools at the state level to take care of people who have pre-existing conditions.  All of these things can work.  We want to move the power out to the states and allow them to develop health care programs that work for them.  ",2,915.0,160.0,guest,102.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
125,WALLACE,"  Let's turn to the confirmation.  You pointed out that’s a Senate-only responsibility.  The confirmation of the Trump cabinet, the Senate has approved only two nominees so far.  We got them up on the screen, General James Mattis for defense, John Kelly for homeland security.  We’ll get to what the Democrats are doing to try to slow this down in a moment.   But as you sit here today, do you know as the Senate majority leader that you have the votes to pass all the other Trump nominees?  ",2,492.0,90.0,host,103.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
126,MCCONNELL,"  I’m confident we will, yes.  What's been unfortunate is that all I asked for of my colleague, Senator Schumer, was to treat President Trump the same way we treated President Obama.  Obviously, we were not happy with any of his nominees either.  But he got seven of them on the first day.  We got two.   They even delayed the CIA.  Delayed the CIA until Monday for some inexplicable reason.  ",2,393.0,72.0,guest,104.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
127,WALLACE,"  I’m just -- I’m going to get to Schumer in a second, but do you believe you have the votes to confirm all them once you get into an actual vote?  ",2,148.0,33.0,host,105.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
128,MCCONNELL,  I believe we’ll be able to confirm the president’s entire cabinet.  There’s great enthusiasm.  ,2,97.0,16.0,guest,106.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

136,MCCONNELL,"  Selective outrage.  Jack Lew, the outgoing treasury secretary, had an account in the Cayman Islands.  Geithner, who was the treasury secretary before him, failed to pay taxes.  At that point, Schumer said, well, it's just a mistake.  Everybody makes mistakes.   So, this kind of selective outrage against the kind of mistakes that people inherently make strikes me as just another delaying tactic.  Senator Schumer would even complain about not having enough seats in the hearing room.  These are all kind of manufactured reasons, Chris, to slow down the process, because they don't want this administration to be treated like other administrations, and being given the opportunity to get up and get started.  ",2,712.0,115.0,guest,112.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
137,WALLACE,"  But, Senator, weren’t you guilty of some selective outrage back in 2009?  I want to point out, there was a case -- Tom Daschle, former Senate majority leader, we learned that he failed to pay back taxes through a car and a driver.  There was a big fuss about that.   Here is you -- here you are in 2009.  ",2,307.0,62.0,host,113.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

139,MCCONNELL,"  It does raise some questions about the vetting process.  This is now the second time we had a similar incident.  First with the nominee for secretary of the treasury, and now, with Senator Daschle.  I think the administration ought to take a look at its vetting process.  ",2,274.0,49.0,guest,114.0,1,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

142,MCCONNELL,"  Well, Daschle decided not to go forward.  Geithner did go forward and he had a tax problem as well.  I mean, the administration, in the end, decided not to go forward with Daschle.  We don't know whether that would have been a decisive mistake or not.  ",2,255.0,48.0,guest,116.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
143,WALLACE,"  But my point is, you made a fuss in 2009 about Daschle, they are making a fuss about some people today.  ",2,107.0,23.0,host,117.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
144,MCCONNELL,"  Look, you can complain about whatever you choose to, ultimately though, the administration decides who submitted and members decide whether these kinds of mistakes that people make from time to time are decisive in determining how they're going to vote.  ",2,257.0,42.0,guest,118.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
145,WALLACE,"  Finally, President Trump says he wants to name a Supreme Court nominee.  He's talked about doing it within two weeks.  And Senator Schumer has said that they’re going to block anyone that they don't like, that they feel is outside the mainstream.   As Senate rules now stand, because the -- the nuclear option was -- was extended, it -- on a partial level in 2013 by the Democrats, you can confirm lower court judges with just 51 votes.",2,438.0,80.0,host,119.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

148,MCCONNELL," Well, let me just say, I’m confident we’ll get a Supreme Court nominees confirmed. I expect an outstanding nominee sometime soon. I think it's noteworthy to look at how the Republican minority handled Bill Clinton the first -- in his first administration. Both -- both of his first two nominees, Ginsburg and Breyer, no filibuster. Obama, in his first term, to go, no filibuster. We think our nominee ought to be treated the same way. If he is not treated that way, then, under the current Senate rule, we would have to get cloture. That is, we’d have to get 60 votes. We had to do that when the Democrats objecting to Justice Alito 10 years ago, but cloture was invoked. Sorry for the long answer. I think the short answer is, the nominee will be confirmed.",2,759.0,138.0,guest,122.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

167,"KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"," Yes, I think he was very clear. This was a very Trumpian speech. People have called it dark, but I think it was actually a speech for our time. The American public right now does not want to have a president who went out with fancy language and sort of soaring rhetoric. A lot of them are indeed feeling forgotten. And basically those few words he said, every decision will be about you, suggests that he's going to be very attuned to public sentiment, and that’s what’s going to be driving him.

That may have been the most poetic part of his speech. The problem, Chris, is that he exaggerated. He talked about American carnage in what he called inner cities. I suppose he's calling black areas of our metropolitan areas. And, to me, that’s alarmist. It’s an exaggeration. It's not reality.

189,ELLEITHEE," What I think was wrong with his speech -- look, I give him a lot of credit on that speech for a couple of reasons. One, he was very consistent. It was very trumpian. This was the message that got him here, and it was targeted to the same people who voted for him. But that wasn't a majority of the country. I'm not saying he wasn’t elected president, right. I mean he was elected president of the United States. But a majority of the American people did not vote for him. And I heard very little in that speech that would actually appeal to those people. This was a very good, very Trump speech for a narrow -- or narrow is not the right word -- but for a specific audience. His supporters. Will he begin to appeal and bring more people in? He’s entering office with the lowest approval ratings of any president ever in the history of polling. That should be a bit of a concern for him, rather than just play to his supporters, which I think he did very, very well.",4,966.0,187.0,guest,155.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

194,STRASSEL," Exactly. So in that regard, I do think his speech was speaking to more than just those who voted for him because that is a unifying theme out there. You talk to the Trump people, you talk to congressional Republicans, and what they are banking on is that you come in and you get some things done immediately, some big things that people can see, and that that is what is going to end up moving some people in his favor, more than words of unity in a is speech.",4,461.0,91.0,guest,160.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

200,WALLACE,"  President Trump complaining about reports on the size of the crowd at his inauguration while speaking at the CIA in front of the memorial to officers who died while serving our country. And we’re back now with the panel. Well, Bret, you and I both covered the White House for years. And when White House press secretaries call special briefings, especially late in the afternoon, especially late in the afternoon on a Saturday afternoon, it's a big deal. It's a big personnel announcement. It's a big policy announcement. In your years covering, I can tell you not in mine, have you ever seen a White House press secretary coming in to excoriate the press for their reports on crowd size?",5,690.0,121.0,host,163.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
201,BAIER," No. And yesterday we were, you know, preparing for some big announcement on policy or some -- something, but then it was this excoriating message from Sean Spicer. One thing is clear, if anybody doubts that he’s speaking on his own, and not on behalf of the president of the United States, that's not true. He's -- clearly was told to get out there and do this because of -- after the remarks by President Trump early on. I think it was unusual. It was very different. I talked to people in the Briefing Room. They were shocked. But people at home, they said -- the supporters said, this is exactly what we want. Break the china. Forget it. You know, how he deals with the press. This is the completion of the takeover of the Republican Party, and I don’t say hostile takeover because people want willingly, because of the actions of the Obama administration and Republicans. And part of that is dealing with the press, as shocking as Washington is going to have to come to grips with. But I’ll tell you, it was shocking yesterday.",5,1032.0,189.0,guest,164.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
202,WALLACE,"  I was going to say, I wish that there had been a reverse shot showing the reporters in the Briefing Room, because my guess is their jaws would have dropped. It would have been a look of complete astonishment. Juan, you were also a White House reporter. You’ve sat in that briefing room. What did you make of it?",5,313.0,60.0,host,165.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
203,WILLIAMS," Sean Spicer’s a good solider. I think just as Bret said, he was sent out there, I think much the way that he was sent out at one of the news conferences in New York to deal with the Russian allegations. But when I think back to press secretaries, from Larry Speakes, to Tony Snow, Dana Perino, John Earnest, Robert Gibbs, I've never seen anything like him. I mean that’s just -- I mean I’m just being straight with you guys. It suggested to me the question, where do you go from here? If that was the opening bid, if that's the way you feel, if the president is calling the press a bunch of dishonest human beings, and Spicer’s sent out to scream and performing in that manner, to say to the press, you have no cred -- if you -- I suspect this is about legitimacy. That they are very fearful and uptight about the idea that they are being delegitimized from day one.",5,867.0,167.0,guest,166.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
204,WALLACE,"  Well, you heard that from Reince Priebus.",5,43.0,8.0,host,167.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
205,WILLIAMS," Indeed, today on this show. But I think that this response is so out-of-the-box that it adds to questions about presidential behavior. Do they -- are they acting like a White House that we'd seen before? Well, if they want to say, it's unique, it's different, they’re breaking the china, fine, but they’re also hurting their standing, I think, not only with a press, but with the American people.",5,397.0,70.0,guest,168.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
206,WALLACE,"  Well, there's another aspect to what happened yesterday that, to me, is even more troubling, and that is that the president said several things that just weren't true. First of all, at the CIA he said that all the reports of his rift with the intelligence community were a media invention. As I discussed with Reince Priebus, that’s not true. I mean he was the one who said it was disgraceful what the intelligence community did and compared it to Nazi Germany. And then through Spicer he said that this was the biggest audience ever to attend an inauguration. That’s also not true.",5,584.0,104.0,host,169.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
207,ELLEITHEE," The president of the United States yesterday stood on hallowed ground, in front of a memorial wall of fallen CIA officers, and he looked at the American people and he lied. He lied more than once. He lied about something of substance, his relationship with the CIA and what he has said in the past, and he lied about the most trivial of things he possibly could lie about, crowd sizes at an inaugural. We talked about the Spicer pieces. There’s -- even more troubling than that, they shut down the National Park Service’s communications tool, its Twitter, because the national Park Service tweeted out the crowd size estimates. This should be of concern to everybody, not just to the press, but to everybody. If people already are feeling a lack of trust in our government, this is not going to make it better. This is a Nixonian (ph) politics in the Twitter area.",5,865.0,155.0,guest,170.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

211,STRASSEL," Here's what you have to understand though. Yes, people lack trust in institutions. And you want to know one of the major institutions they lack trust in? The media. So, you know, the president isn't going to stop this. He feels that there's no downside to this. This is a time-honored tradition, especially among Republican presidents, to talk about the media as a foil. And the media did itself no benefits in the run-up to the election. I mean I'm not saying everyone around this table accepted, obviously. But --",5,516.0,91.0,guest,174.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

213,STRASSEL," But, you know, all of the predictions of Donald Trump could not win, all of the stories, the day-to-day coverage some of the major newspapers and promotions of Hillary Clinton and against Donald Trump. And Donald Trump believes that, you know, if he goes to war with the media, and he likes to feud with people, who better than to feud with in the media because the public --",5,376.0,70.0,guest,176.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

215,STRASSEL," I don't know. I mean, again, you have to believe that the American public has more trust in the media than they do in the new president, and I'm not sure that's a clear cut bet.",5,178.0,37.0,guest,178.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

217,WALLACE,  Right.,5,8.0,2.0,host,180.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
218,BAIER," And, you know, it -- it just didn’t -- can’t come. He -- he went to the teleprompter at the end. Then he gets to be president-elect and he says sometimes presidential is going to look different. I'm going to do presidential different. Well, if people are looking for it to be different, I don't think it's going to happen. The one issue is that when he goes on the rifts (ph), words do matter. And Eisenhower said, less is more, back in his day from the Oval Office. So it's not just the U.S. and his supporters who are looking at it, but there are countries around the world who are analyzing every word and what they mean.",5,625.0,120.0,guest,181.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
219,WALLACE,"  And -- and, Juan, you know, I -- I wonder if -- whether President Trump -- far be it for me to tell him what to do or who’s right -- but I think that he thinks because he won that he didn't pay any price during the campaign. But you look back at some of the -- the moment when he got into the fight with a gold star family, when he went after the Mexican-American judge, he did pay a price. Yes, he ended up winning the election in the end, some would say because Hillary Clinton was a -- a -- a bad candidate, but you can't defy the laws of political gravity forever.",5,570.0,118.0,host,182.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22
220,WILLIAMS," No. And what’s intriguing to me is, traditionally, an inaugural speech really is sort of a unifying effort by the victor saying come together America, I am your president, I am your leader. In giving the speech that he gave and the behavior that he’s displayed and his press secretary displayed on the very first day, I think it is a defiance. I think it's first pumping. I think it’s very proud, OK, but there's no sense in which, oh, my gosh, look at all those protesters in the street. Oh, my gosh, I acknowledge that there are some issues here and I want to bring us together. I just don't see that. I mean, you know, we were talking about press secretaries earlier. I used to get calls from press secretaries, White House press secretaries, and they’d be like, why did that story leaked? You’re out of the loop. We’re not -- you know, very personal. The idea that you would stand and lecture the whole American press, no matter how badly they may think of us, Kim, we play an important role in American democracy, and you can't just throw the whole thing out. I just felt like, wow, what is going -- it made me concerned?",5,1127.0,210.0,guest,183.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-22

But what Donald Trump was talking about their was literally generations of failed policies coming out of Washington, D.C., that have failed to many families and too many cities across this country.  I will tell you, Donald Trump is a man who is profoundly impatient with failure.  And you saw in the campaign, he went to major cities in this country and said we are going to bring safety to our streets.  We’re going to bring school choice to our children.  We’re going to bring jobs and opportunities to our cities.   You remember that great line ""what the heck do you have to lose?""  He’s committed to being president of all the people in this country and to bring new jobs and prosperity in ways that the failed liberal policies of the last several generations have not.  ",1,1319.0,244.0,guest,17.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-15
21,WALLACE,"  Let me pick up on another controversy this week, because Mr. Trump has been going after the intelligence community, especially after they briefed him, and it became a public that they had briefed him both as unverified oppo research that the Kremlin allegedly put together on him.  On Friday, Mr. Trump sent these tweets, ""Probably released by ‘intelligence’,"" intelligence in quotes, ""even knowing there is no proof, and never will be."" Does the president-elect really believe that the intelligence community is trying to undercut him and does he stand by his comparison of those tactics to Nazi Germany?  ",1,609.0,100.0,host,18.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-15

29,WALLACE,"  Let's talk about policy going forward, because the president-elect's seemed to suggest in an interview this weekend with The Wall Street Journal that he might dramatically change relations with Russia, and in fact lift sanctions against Russia if they begin to cooperate with us on ISIS and other areas.  I want to put a quote from that interview.   Mr. Trump said, ""If you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody’s doing some really great things?"" How quickly might he end sanctions on Russia?  ",1,549.0,95.0,host,26.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-15
30,PENCE,"  I think -- I think the president-elect has made it very clear that we have a terrible relationship with Russia right now, and that's not all our own doing, but it really is a failure of American diplomacy in successive administrations.  And what the president-elect is determined to do is explore the possibility of better relations.  We have a common enemy in ISIS, the ability to work with Russia to confront, hunt down, and destroy ISIS at its source represents an enormously important priority of this incoming administration. But I think what the American people like about Donald Trump is he someone who can sit down, roll the sleeves up, and make a deal.  And I think what you're hearing in his reflections, whether it’d be with Russia, whether it’d be with China, whether it’d be with other countries in the world is that we are going to reengage.  We are going to put America first.  We’re going to put America’s interest first.  But we’re going to reengage in a way that advances America’s interest in the world and advances peace.  ",1,1045.0,183.0,guest,27.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-15

82,BRENNAN,"  Well, nothing has been verified.  It is unsubstantiated reporting that is out there, that has been circulating in the private sector and with the media as well by a firm that pulled this information together.   But what I do find outrageous is equating the intelligence community with Nazi Germany.  I do take great umbrage at that, and there is no basis for Mr. Trump to point fingers at the intelligence community for leaking information that was already available publicly.  ",2,480.0,82.0,guest,70.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-15
83,WALLACE,"  But it wasn't available publicly.  Various news organizations, if I may, various news organization had it, but they weren't reporting it because it hadn't been verified.  And this brings me to the real question, Director Brennan, why on earth within nations intelligence spy chief's brief President-elect Trump in your first meeting collectively with him on this unverified information?  First of all, it wasn't intelligence, it was rumors.  And secondly, my briefing him on it, you made it a news event and, therefore, gave news organizations an excuse to report it.  ",2,571.0,92.0,host,71.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-15

86,BRENNAN,"  Chris, bringing to the attention of the president-elect, as well as to the current president that this was circulating out there was a responsibility in the minds of the intelligence directors, of the intelligence community to make sure that there was going to be no evaluation of it, but just making sure that the president-elect was aware that it was circulating.  ",2,369.0,63.0,guest,74.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-15

88,BRENNAN,"  Well, I think anybody who has read the reports that are out there, I think there are some very salacious allegations in there, again, unsubstantiated, that were circulating.  And so, making sure that the president-elect himself was aware of it.  I think that was the extent of what it was that the intelligence chiefs wanted to do.  ",2,335.0,59.0,guest,76.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-15
89,WALLACE,"  One of the questions, though, is whether the intelligence community is going after -- or somehow is going to try to undercut by selective leaks the new president-elect.   Let me ask my question, because former top intelligence officials have been bashing Mr. Trump for months, and I want to put a couple of these on the screen.  Former acting CIA Director Mike Morell wrote, ""In the intelligence business, we would say Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian federation."" And then, former CIA Director Michael Hayden said he’d prefer a different term, ""That's the useful fool, some naif, manipulated by Moscow, secretly held in contempt, but his blind support is happily accepted and exploited."" Can you understand given that and given all these leaks that have been coming out for months, why the president-elect with think the intelligence community had it in for him?  ",2,905.0,153.0,host,77.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-15

92,BRENNAN,"  Well, there are many dangers.  I think the world is watching now what Mr. Trump says, and listening very carefully.  If he doesn't have confidence in the intelligence community, what signal does that send to our partners and allies, as well as our adversaries? So, I think Mr. Trump has to be very disciplined in terms of what it is that he says publicly, he is going to be in a few days' time, the most powerful person in the world in terms of sitting on top of the United States government and I think he has to recognize that his words do have impact.  And they can have very positive impact, or they can be undercutting of our national security.  ",2,653.0,123.0,guest,80.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-15

104,BRENNAN,"  I don't think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia's intentions, and actions that they are undertaking in many parts of the world.  And that's with the obligation and responsibility of the intelligence community is.   I very much hope that our relationship with Russia improves in the coming administration -- absolutely -- because there are very important things we need to do, not just on counterterrorism, but trying to deal with political instability around the globe.  But here is a fair amount of responsibility on Russia's part to change their behavior, change their actions.  And what we need to do is make sure that Mr. Trump and vice president-elect. Mr. Pence, understand exactly what it is that we know, what we have intelligence about, so that when they make those decisions, it will be -- they will be informed decisions.  ",2,861.0,145.0,guest,90.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-15

110,BRENNAN,"  The problem is, the challenges that he is going to face numerous ones immediately.  You have the problems of terrorism, clearly, the cyber challenge that we just are talking about in terms of elections and other types of cyber capabilities that other countries have. North Korea, increasing development of its nuclear and ballistic missile capability, instability that has wracked the Middle East.  There are so many issues that the new administration is going to have responsibility for on day one, and that’s why we’re trying to make sure that he and his team are fully briefed on all of these issues.  ",2,607.0,103.0,guest,96.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-15

112,BRENNAN,"  Well, what I think Mr. Trump has to understand is that this is more than being about him and it's about the United States and our national security.  And he has to make sure that now he's going to have the opportunity to do something for national security, as opposed to talking and tweeting, he's going to have tremendous responsibility to make sure that U.S. national security interests are protected and are advanced.   And so, I am very much hoping that he has some very good people that he has pulled together, Jim Mattis, Mike Pompeo, John Kelly, and others.  I think they are the ones that are going to be able to give him some wise counsel about what he needs to do and not be very spontaneous in his words and his actions.  Spontaneity is not something that protects national security interests.  And so, therefore, when he speaks, when he reacts, just to make sure he understands that the implications and impact on the United States could be profound.

114,BRENNAN," First, source of pride being part of an administration – part of an administration that really has tried to advance the interests of peace and stability around the world at a very challenging time, bringing bin Laden to justice, being able to prevent a recurrence of an 9/11 attack here in the homeland. These were things that the administration and the government, as a whole, really did some great work. Regrets, when I look at the situation in Syria, I think my heart and a lot of hearts bleeds over what has happened to that beautiful country. And I – I regret that we were not able to find a way to arrest the growth of violence and bloodshed there so that we could make sure that Syria is going to have a future for the – at least the next generation of Syrians.

And, overall, how do you think of the way they’ve handle Donald Trump?",4,706.0,111.0,host,112.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-15

135,WOODWARD," Yes, and a useful fool. I mean they started this. And in Trump's mind, he knows the old adage, once a CIA man, always a CIA man. And no one came out and said those people shouldn't be saying things. So then act two is the briefing when this dossier is put out. I – I've lived in this world for 45 years where you get things and people make allegations. That is a garbage document. It never should have been presented in – as part of an intelligence briefing. As you suggested, other channels have the White House Counsel give it to Trump's incoming White House counsel. So Trump's right to be upset about that. And I think if you look at the real chronology and the nature of the battle here, those intelligence chiefs who were the best we’ve had, who were terrific and have done great work made a mistake here. And when people make mistakes, they should apologize.",4,866.0,163.0,guest,115.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-15

But from the other side, I can understand that very careful and highly trained intelligence professionals think they’re being dissed. John Brennen just said that in hindsight he might have done some things differently. I agree with Bob, there was another way to handle that salacious two page unsubstantiated dossier. But I think the intelligence community seriously has put out its case starting in early October when Jeh Johnson and I think it was Mike Rogers put out the case that there was Russian hacking.

141,"GERALD F. SEIB, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"," Well, that's not clear, but what is clear is that the mindset is totally different. This is a -- everything is open for negotiation kind of an approach to the two biggest countries outside the U.S. in the world. The two most important, Russia and China. And he literally said with China, everything is open to negotiation, including the One-China policy. This was the policy by which the U.S. has for years and years recognized Beijing as the one and only true representative government of the people of China, not Taiwan. And on Russia sanctions, he said, I’ll keep the sanctions in place for a while, but we’ll see how the Russians behave. And it's very much a transactional kind of an approach to foreign policy. You’re nice to us, we’ll find ways to be nice to you, and vice versa. And it's going to be different.

150,BOOTHE," Good point. No, I think it’s going to be constructive, so to answer that for clarity sake. But, you know, look, I mean Donald Trump can't win here because he got a lot of criticism during the general election that he wouldn’t take the advice of counsel, that he wouldn’t take the advice of his advisor, but he has surrounded himself with some very smart and capable people, as the CIA director pointed out in his interview with you as far as General Mattis goes. And I think he’ll have a lot more faith in the intelligence community when he does have some people there that he trusts, like someone like Mike Pompeo. In regards to Russia as well, I think the biggest problem here is the distrust, the erosion of trust in – in just institutions at large when you have the fact that the media reported something that The New York Times said was very difficult to check. And even what could – can be checked is problematic when the fact that you have sitting members of Congress saying that they're not going to recognize President-elect Trump as the president because he is illegitimate. When you have individuals that are calling for the abolishment of the Electoral College and we’re calling for electors to defect. So I think the biggest problem that we are dealing with right now is the erosion of trust in all of the institutions, whether it's the intelligence community, the media, and the government at large.",4,1414.0,253.0,guest,128.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-15

If he had recommended an indictment against Hillary Clinton, can you imagine how that would have gone over in this country? And, of course, Loretta Lynch tied his hands by setting out – or by meeting with President Bill Clinton on the tarmac of that plane. And I think this is a continued scapegoating from the left.

If you sell all those things, it's a fire sale, the value that I’ve built up goes out the window automatically. That is the tension in this question. And it's not going to go away.

That's the blunt assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies on the Kremlin’s effort to influence the 2016 election in Donald Trump's favor.  An unclassified report now released after the nation’s spy chiefs briefed Congress, President Obama and President-elect Trump.   In a moment, we’ll get the Trump team’s reaction from incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.   But first, let's bring in chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge with the latest on what the intel community found -- Catherine.  ",1,634.0,99.0,host,8.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
10,"CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT"," Chris, the report has strong language, the tone is authoritative and most of the conclusions are at the high confidence level.  The central finding is that Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized a campaign to undermine and influence the U.S. democratic process, with the goal of damaging Clinton and her chances of winning.  Overtime, the Russians came to favor a Donald Trump victory.   The FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan are very confident Putin wanted to help Mr. Trump.  While the NSA Director Mike Rogers, whose agency analyzes signals intelligence, including intercepted phone calls, was only moderately confident.   The report says Russian intelligence provided the stolen emails to Julian Assange and his website WikiLeaks.  Because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity, Assange has consistently denied the Russian government connection. Writing in a tweet after his classified briefing, the president-elect said there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results, voting machines not touched. Though mentioning Russia, the vice president-elect said the briefing was useful.  ",1,1150.0,171.0,guest,9.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08

20,"REINCE PRIEBUS, INCOMING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF","  Good morning, Chris.   The nation’s intel chiefs laid out the full classified report to President-elect Trump and others in his team, including you that Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered a cyber attack to interfere with the election and eventually came to try to help Donald Trump.   Simple question: does the president-elect accept the findings and the evidence of the intelligence community?",1,402.0,64.0,guest,17.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
21,PRIEBUS,"  Well, I think he accepts the findings, Chris.  But here's the thing that I think everyone needs to understand -- when this whole thing started, it started from the Russians 50 years ago.  In other words, this is something that's been going on in our elections for many, many years, both the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians.  It happens every election period.   Now, in this particular case, it started way back in 2015 before either nominee of either party was chosen, and it started, and this is declassified, as a spear phishing exhibition over many different institutions.  It just so happened that the DNC had nearly no defenses on their system, and when they were warned multiple times by the FBI, they didn't respond.   And so, suddenly, you have a major political party, one of the biggest political parties in the world, that by their own admission lacked defenses, lacked training, and allowed a foreign government into their entire email system without responding to the FBI.   So, yes, we have bad actors around the world.  We have had bad actors, including the Russians.  But we also have a problem when we have a major political institution that allows foreign governments into their system with hardly any defenses or training.  That's a huge story, and that's what people aren’t talking about as well.  ",1,1324.0,227.0,guest,18.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
22,WALLACE,"  That's a fair point.  And it’s also, we should point out, there is no evidence that the Russians in any way were able to get into the electoral system and tamper with the vote count.   But on Friday, hours before he had the briefing, Donald Trump said that this was, quote, ""a political witch hunt"".   So, I just want to be very clear on two political points.  Does he now accepts -- but you say, well, this has been going on for years, never to this extent, never the hacking and dissemination of emails, and you could argue as to whether they were in some way were complicit in it because of their weaknesses, that we’ve never had this kind of dissemination before.  Does he accept that the Russians were behind this hacking campaign?  Yes or no?  ",1,752.0,141.0,host,19.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
23,PRIEBUS,"  Well, sure.  I mean, he's not denying that entities in Russia were behind this particular campaign.  But let me just -- can you -- let me respond to your point, though.  You say never have we had such a massive -- yes, but here's what we have.  We have the DNC as a sitting duck.   So, if you have a person -- wait a second, because it matters to your point.  It matters because if the DNC allows any foreign entity into their system, says, here is 50,000 emails, you can have them.  Well, voila!  Now, you have the biggest dissemination of emails that we’ve ever seen in the history of America because we have a revolving door at the DNC.",1,641.0,123.0,guest,20.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
24,WALLACE,"  Who do you blame more for this?  Who do you blame more for this, Reince?  Do you blame Putin and the Kremlin?  Or do you blame the DNC?  Who is the primary actor here?  ",1,171.0,36.0,host,21.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08

31,PRIEBUS,"  The thing is -- Russia.   But what I’m telling you is that we also have a situation where you have people at the DNC -- let me ask you this.  Anyone listening out there, if you had multiple calls from the FBI and you said, ""By the way, Chris, this is the FBI, I think someone is in your system and stealing all of your emails"", and you ignore multiple, multiple calls.   They attempted to attack the RNC in the same way.  They didn’t get into our system because number one, we had our head straight and we had defenses at the RNC.  But number two, when the FBI called the RNC and said, we’ve got a hacking situation, we brought them in immediately. And so, granted we have bad actors around the world, and cyber attacks have been happening for years, but we also have an entity that's allowed through a wide open door a foreign government into their system.  ",1,861.0,165.0,guest,28.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
32,WALLACE,  I get that.   One other question.  ,1,37.0,9.0,host,29.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08

34,WALLACE,"  Does President-elect Trump accept the evidence that he heard, does he find it persuasive, that Putin's interest towards the end of the campaign was to help Trump by discrediting Clinton?  ",1,190.0,32.0,host,31.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
35,PRIEBUS,"  I haven't asked him about that, Chris.  I mean, he accepts the fact that Russia and other entities engaged in cyber attacks on the United States all day long.  He accepts the fact that this particular case was entities in Russia.  So, that's not the issue.   But -- and if you look at his statement, after he commends the intelligence community in the very first paragraph, he talks about the particular hack.  He talks about the fact that the DNC was a sitting duck while at the RNC had its act together.  He then says in the first 90 days of his administration, he is going to order a full report as to what we can do to be better.   But one of the things we can do to be better is when the FBI calls you and says you have a problem, you return the phone call.  ",1,766.0,152.0,guest,32.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
36,WALLACE,"  Well, I want to ask about that, because he said yesterday in which he said that we want to have better relations with Russia.  I mean, if he accepts the fact that they, in an unprecedented way, tried to interfere with our election, does that mean he is not going to respond, he's not going to take action against Russia?  ",1,324.0,62.0,host,33.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
37,PRIEBUS,"  He very well, he's going to order the intelligence community to make recommendations, and whatever those recommendations are will be discussed and actions may be taken, but I don't think there's anything wrong with trying to have a good relationship with Russia and other countries around the world.  And that's what the president is saying, that he is going to have good relationships around the world that will put America first, bring jobs back and make a safer across the globe.  That's what he wants to do and I think that's what he will do.  ",1,550.0,97.0,guest,34.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
38,WALLACE,"  I want to consider the question of the president-elect's relations, not with Russia, but with the intelligence community.  Because here was a tweet that he put out on Tuesday.  ""The, quote, ‘intelligence’ briefly on the so-called, quote, ‘Russian hacking’ was delayed until Friday.  Perhaps more time needed to build a case.  Very strange.""

43,PRIEBUS,"  Well -- and Mr. Clapper also stated that there is no evidence in the report that any of this changed the outcome of the election.   But to your question, here's what happened -- the president of the United States, a week earlier, a few days earlier, took on an enormous and unprecedented sanctions against Russia.  We then went into full gear to get an intelligence briefing on what the president knew that created that strong reaction, or what the briefing was that created that is sudden, strong reaction, and we were attempting to have that full-blown meeting on Tuesday.  ",1,578.0,102.0,guest,38.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08

47,PRIEBUS,"  Because I’m getting to the point.   The reason he put it in quotes is that the intelligence briefing in quotes that we were attempting to have was going to be on Tuesday.  It turns out, that the report, which apparently was supposed to be done that created the Obama reaction, wasn't going to be done until Wednesday, and therefore, the intelligence briefing in quotes that we were supposed to have on Tuesday was then, we were informed, was going to be done on Friday.   So, here we are having to react to these Russian sanctions stories with the media and all of you, folks, you -- and you’re a good one, Chris.  We were supposed to be reacting to something that we had no ability to get a briefing on because the actual report wasn't done until Wednesday.  It's a frustrating situation and that's what the president-elect was referring.",1,841.0,152.0,guest,41.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
48,WALLACE,"  Yes, but the question is the way the relationship that he has with the intelligence community, what even the DNI, General Clapper, saw as disparagement.   I want to ask you about something else, because the president-elect this week seemed to put more credibility to believe the founder of WikiLeaks over the intelligence community.  And I want to put up another tweet that the president-elect said on Wednesday.   ""Julian Assange said a 14-year-old could have hacked Podesta -- why was DNC so careless?  Also said the Russians did not give him the info."" Reince, several years back, I don't have to tell you, Julian Assange published, disclosed, hundreds of thousands of classified cables and other emails and documents that very much compromised the U.S. military in Iraq and that endanger the lives of hundreds of Afghan informants helping the U.S. military.   Why would the president-elect give any credibility to Julian Assange?  ",1,937.0,155.0,host,42.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
49,PRIEBUS,"  Well, first of all, to your other point, he has tremendous respect to the people in the intelligence community.  In his statement on Friday, it was the very first thing he said, and he wanted to make it clear to everyone working hard in the interest of our foreign intelligence that he appreciates them very much.   As to Assange, he doesn’t think this guy is a good guy.  He put in quotes things that he had said.  He didn't say I support this guy.  He didn’t say I think he's a good guy.  ",1,493.0,96.0,guest,43.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
50,WALLACE,  Why even quote him?  Why even give him any credibility?  He’s the president-elect.,1,84.0,14.0,host,44.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
51,PRIEBUS,"  I think his point is that -- well, wait a second, I think his point is that the DNC was so lacking in any of their defenses, by their own admission.  ",1,152.0,33.0,guest,45.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08

53,PRIEBUS,"  Perhaps a 14-year-old could have gotten into the -- but perhaps a 14-year-old could have gotten into the DNC.  When you have staffers opening up emails that say, you know, ""I’m stranded in Mali and I need $20,000, click on this link"", and the DNC is clicking on these links.   You know, I’ve got to tell you something, no one thinks that Assange is a great guy, I can assure you of that.  But I think the issue here is yes, bad foreign actors, but it's also the DNC that has allowed itself to be hacked by about anyone in the world, and that is one of the reasons why this was such a big deal.  ",1,597.0,119.0,guest,47.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08

66,PRIEBUS,"  Well, first of all, Chuck Schumer and President-elect Trump have a long, long relationship together.  Donald Trump has helped Chuck Schumer in his runs for Senate.  Donald Trump has had massive fundraiser for Chuck Schumer at Mar-a-Lago many times before.  They have a personal relationship.   And I’ve got to tell you -- I mean, when Senator Schumer says that he is going to allow the vacancy in the Supreme Court to take as long as he wants, and he's going to hold up cabinet secretaries and he's targeting eight of them when only just a few short years ago, it was the Democrats that were saying, we needed to move swiftly to approve these cabinet secretaries.  Eight cabinet secretaries were approved for President Obama on day one.  And now, they turn around and say they're going to drag their feet and put people through the ringer -- I mean, look, it's a frustrating situation.  They’re very --",1,904.0,159.0,guest,57.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08

70,WALLACE,"  Reince, I just want to pick up on that -- we got less than a minute left -- because the Office of Government Ethics announced this week that it has been unable to complete background ethics checks on the number of Trump's nominees and said it's a great concern that these confirmation hearings are going to go forward before those background checks are complete.  If Senator Schumer says you're trying to jam them through.   Given the statement by the Office of Government Ethics, any thought of delaying the confirmation hearings for any of these nominees until the background checks are complete?  ",1,602.0,104.0,host,60.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
71,PRIEBUS,"  No.  I mean, they have to get -- they have to get moving.  They have to move faster, and they have all the information.  These are -- these are people that have been highly successful in their lives.   They need to move quicker.  And the fact is, there is no reason.  I mean, it’s the first week of January.  They have all the details that they need.  If they have all the information that they need.   It's no different from any other new administration coming in and the American people demanded.  Change was voted for and change we will get.  ",1,548.0,104.0,guest,61.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08

79,"REP. DEVIN NUNES, R-CALI., HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN",  It’s great to be here in person.  ,2,36.0,9.0,guest,68.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
80,WALLACE,"  Before we get to that, let's talk first about the terrible attack in Fort Lauderdale, where five people were killed, six people were wounded.  Any evidence this is terror-related?  ",2,183.0,31.0,host,69.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
81,NUNES,"  Well, the investigation is ongoing.  Clearly, this person walked into the FBI, we know this now, and said that he was watching ISIS videos.  It's sometimes I think going to be hard in these situations to know where someone who has mental illness, and also is an ISIS follower, and where that sometimes they can be intertwined.  And I think we just have to let the FBI go through this and see if there is any actual data or evidence to show that this was an ISIS follower.  ",2,475.0,90.0,guest,70.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
82,WALLACE,"  Of course, the big question people have is, how did this happen?  And could it happen again, particularly with the guy having walked into the FBI office?  Should he have been on a no-fly list?  Should he have been allowed to carry a gun, check it in his baggage and take on the flight with him?  ",2,298.0,58.0,host,71.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
83,NUNES,"  Well, right, this is -- this is the big challenge that the FBI faces with -- you know, there's investigations going on in all 50 states with ISIS followers and people who are -- who claim they’re ISIS followers.  And so, some of these cases get close and I think in this case, this one probably shouldn't have been closed.  ",2,326.0,62.0,guest,72.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08

86,WALLACE,"  So, do you think the FBI messed up?",2,37.0,9.0,host,75.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
87,NUNES,"  Well, look, I think the FBI would tell you that this is -- this is not what the FBI wants.  I mean, they do a very good.  But they -- obviously, they missed this one.  ",2,170.0,37.0,guest,76.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
88,WALLACE,"  As chair of House Intelligence, you received the same classified report on Friday.  Any doubt in your mind that Russian President Putin directed this attack and at some point -- not originally -- but at some point, it became an effort to stop Clinton and help Trump?  ",2,270.0,49.0,host,77.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
89,NUNES,"  So, six months ago, I publicly came out and said that this was the biggest intelligence failure since 9/11, was our failure to understand Putin’s plans and intentions.   If you -- so, this has been going on for a long time.  We've known that Russia is a very sophisticated bad actor in the cyber realm.  Many members of Congress, not just members of the House Intelligence Committee, have been warning the Obama administration about Russia's continued cyber attacks on this country, and they did nothing.   And so, now, as you look forward, you know, they lose an election, and then it appears like they want to change this narrative into somehow that Russia was responsible for Hillary Clinton losing the election.  And I just don't buy that.  ",2,747.0,131.0,guest,78.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
90,WALLACE,"  No, and I want to make this very clear.  There’s no indication, despite Russia's efforts, and the intelligence community doesn't say this is why Trump won and she lost.  But the two things can be true, they try to do a campaign, and Trump won a fair and square election.   I want to go follow up on this policy issue, though, because you say that Mr. Trump has to be tougher than President Obama was in responding to cyber aggression, especially by the Russians, but I want you to respond to this tweet, which I discussed with Reince Priebus.  Trump tweeted this on Saturday, ""Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing.  Only stupid people or fools would think that it is bad."" This is his first reaction about getting his briefing about Russian interference in the election.  It doesn't sound like he’s ready to crack down on the Kremlin.  ",2,873.0,159.0,host,79.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
91,NUNES,"  And he wouldn't be the first president to want to be buddies with Putin.  So, you had President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, including Secretary Clinton who hit the reset button.  Don't forget that you had President Obama, who got caught on a hot mic talking about being more flexible after the election with Vladimir. So, clearly, three presidents have tried to be friends with Putin.  All three have failed, and I hope that Donald Trump, you know, he has a lot more information going into this, and I’ve cautioned his administration to be careful with Putin, because I think he is a bad actor.   Although it remains true, the fact of the matter is, we would like to be friends with the Russians.  I just don't know if it's possible.  We’ve had a lot of experience with Putin.  He just doesn't seem to be a guy that we can work with.  ",2,851.0,155.0,guest,80.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
92,WALLACE,"  I -- as a member, as we said, you’re not only head of House Intelligence, you are also a member of the transition team, particularly in these very areas of national security.  And I want to ask about the nomination of Senator Dan Coats, to be the director of national intelligence.   Back when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, Senator Coats said this, ""Does this not remind us of what happened with Hitler in the early ‘20s and ‘30s?""  And in response, the Kremlin banned him from traveling to Russia. So, what does the appointment of a clear hardliner, what does it say about this effort by President-elect Trump and some of his team to try -- or believe they can have better relations with Russia?  ",2,701.0,128.0,host,81.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
93,NUNES,"  Well, as I said before, I think all presidents have been making this mistake.  But I think you bring up a good point that Dan Coats is Russia hock.  Mike Pompeo, the future CIA director, is a Russia hock.  General Mattis, who will be secretary of defense, is a Russia hock. So, Donald Trump is surrounding himself with very good people who understand the threat that Russia poses.  ",2,384.0,70.0,guest,82.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
94,WALLACE,"  Let me just say, you’ve also got Rex Tillerson, who has done business with Russia, and received the friend of Russia medal, and you have Lieutenant General Mike Flynn, the national security advisor, who had dinner with Putin.  So, I mean -- there's a split inside the administration about Russia.  ",2,300.0,52.0,host,83.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
95,NUNES,"  Yes.  But like I said, Chris, this is not unusual for administrations to want to work with Putin.  I mean, they’ve tried -- all administrations have tried, going back to the first President Clinton when Putin was first put into office.  So, I just don’t see where this is anything different, and I think the news media is trying to blow this up -- or I say the Democrats are trying to blow this up, because they’re trying to change the narrative of what happened in this election.   You know, I am not happy that this report, that we were briefed on, just the Gang of Eight, was briefed on Friday morning, yet many news media outlets already have the information that was briefed to the Gang of Eight.  So, this looks like a political rollout of a narrative just a couple weeks before Donald Trump's inauguration, and it bothers me, and I don’t think it’s good.  And the Intelligence Committee --",2,898.0,164.0,guest,84.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08

102,WALLACE,"  I want to ask you about another question.  President-elect Trump talks about tearing up the nuclear deal with Iran.  But the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, said this week, you know, leave that alone for a while.  There's not going to be a problem.  There are sanctions in place against Iran and they have to meet some standards, at least for the next few years. And the key is to focus on the more immediate threat of North Korea.   Your reaction?  ",2,484.0,88.0,host,91.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
103,NUNES,"  Well, I think the Iranian regime continues to be one that is the largest funder of terrorism around the globe, and it has to be dealt with swiftly.  And I think the Obama administration has been way too nice to the Iranian regime, who essentially are terrorists.   If you look at North Korea, this is one of the situations I think that people are going to look back as one of the major atrocities in world history.  And people are going to ask, why did somebody not act?  There are -- there are 20 million people living off of eating grass and the roots and trying to burn everything to stay warm in that country.   You look at that country, it’s a -- it’s one of the worst places I've ever seen and I think it doesn’t get enough --",2,734.0,143.0,guest,92.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08

After North Korea announced this week that it's in the final stages of developing an ICBM missile that could -- could reach at least part of the United States, Donald Trump sent out this tweet in which he said at the bottom, ""it won't happen.""

128,WALLACE,"  President Obama giving his successor, Donald Trump, gentle advice about how to deal with the Russian president after the report of Kremlin interference in the U.S. election. And it’s time now for our Sunday group. Laura Ingraham, editor of LifeZette, Fox News political analyst and columnist for ""The Hill,"" Juan Williams, Julie Pace who covers the White House and the transition for the Associated Press, and Michael Needham, head of the conservative think tank Heritage Action for America. Well, Laura, as I was discussing with Reince Priebus and with Congressman Nunes, there are several things, all of which can be true, that the Russians did try to influence the campaign, that the Democrats are trying to use it to delegitimize Trump, and that Trump won the election fair and square. Where does this go from here and how do you think Donald Trump needs to handle Russia and that whole relationship?",4,906.0,152.0,host,111.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
129,"LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST, ""THE LAURA INGRAHAM SHOW"""," I think he has to handle it pragmatically as I think he’s going to handle the economy, which is, eyes wide open. We’ve made a lot of mistakes in the past. I think Priebus made the point of our -- our cyber security, both at the DNC and our own government, it's been pathetic. We are way behind the curve on the cybersecurity. I think you’re going to hear Donald Trump launched an entirely new initiative that will be very transparent and what the government’s going to do to beef it up. But, look, I lived in the former Soviet Union. I know I -- I've been in Russia like seven times in the past five or six years. It does not surprise me in the least that Russia tried to influence the election. Not in the least. I mean this is what they do. This is what the FSB does, the former KGB. It's what the military intelligence does over there. We've done the same thing in other countries. It doesn't make it right. It doesn't make it good. But I think what we have to understand at this point is, Donald Trump’s going to be the president. The country’s either going to improve, get more united behind certain issues or not. And the Democrats can kind of try to hang on to this. I don’t know what purpose it’s going to serve unless it results in better security for all of our systems across the board. But this report was five pages long, the declassified report. Byron York (ph) wrote a great piece about this. Lots of questions remain. There are five pages, broadly spaced. We don't know if Russia was trying to undermine Hillary or help Trump. We don't know exactly when the hacking really began or when the influence campaign began. We don't know if it's just garden-variety propaganda. There are a lot of questions that remain. It doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. I think it should be taken seriously. But to hyperventilate, that, oh, this means that Trump is going to be, you know, a -- you know, in this palsy-walsy (ph) relationship with Trump -- with Putin, I don't see that. I think that’s a fasil (ph) way of looking at this.",4,2031.0,379.0,guest,112.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
130,WALLACE,"  Julie, I want to pick up on something that I discussed with Congressman Nunes. This isn't the first president who’s come in thinking that he's going to get along and tame the Russian bear. Clinton did it. George w. Bush did it, looking into Putin’s eyes. Obama with the reset. What do you think of the chances that they can turn a corner here, or what -- or in the end will it all come to ashes as it did with his predecessors?",4,429.0,84.0,host,113.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
131,"JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"," I think part of the reason you see new president’s come in and take this position, that we want to try to start new with Russia, is because I think everyone generally agrees it would be better if the United States and Russia had better relations. There isn’t a lot of dispute about that. The question that I think Trump has to grapple with here is less about what he's going to do to try and reprove relations, and more about what he's going to need Putin to do. We hear a lot about the Obama administration not being tough enough, not acting quickly enough on -- on hacking and cybersecurity. But what are Trump's measures going to be for Putin? What does he have to do vis-à-vis Assad in Syria, what does he need to do in terms of Russians meddling in Ukraine? I think that is going to be the larger question that will shape this relationship.",4,846.0,160.0,guest,114.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08

143,WILLIAMS," Right. So I think, to me, it -- it -- it stirs up racial tensions already hot from the campaign rhetoric of Donald Trump about the Mexicans and the women and all the rest. And we live in a society now where immediately the response, the strong response online was to tie this somehow into Black Lives Matter. And you see this from the white nationalists who seem excited by Trump’s election, to say, now, this is evidence of black racism, as if that were therefore legitimize acts of white racism. It just -- it becomes perverse. You know, everything -- conversations about Dylann Roof, about a disabled black kid that was tortured, not on tape or live, as you describe it, so we didn't know about that. But clearly there’s something happening in the society that is deeply troubling on the level of race and difference. And the key here is, I think as -- you know, response -- for responsible people, including our president-elect, to act, to speak out and to say very clearly, this is unacceptable.",4,1001.0,180.0,guest,124.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
144,WALLACE,"  We asked you for questions for the panel, and we got a lot of responses about this, including this on FaceBook from Roddie Spaniel Shelley. ""Why is it more important to focus on politics in the crime than race? It was a racial hate crime. Say the words. It's finally time to call it what it is."" Michael, how do you answer Roddie?",4,332.0,64.0,host,125.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08
145,"MICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA"," Well, I think this is the problem with hate crimes legislation in the first place. Look, what is problematic in the video that you saw is that it is despicable, and it is torturing of a mentally disabled person. And I think for us, and a lot of what Juan was just saying in terms of talking about the racial aspects of it, we shouldn't have hate crime legislation. We shouldn't be saying that if you torture somebody because of politics or you torture somebody because of race, that’s worse that if you torture somebody live on camera because of money or just because you’re a sick, depraved individual. And the additional problem with hate crimes legislation is that you’re forcing -- in this case it’s very easy. They’re saying on tape why they’re doing it and what they’re believing. But in many of these hate crimes cases, you’re actually forcing a jury or a judge to get inside the mind of a depraved killer or torturer. And so I think we should be looking at the crime that was committed. We should be looking at the crime that’s committed in all of these hate crimes, so-called hate crimes there have been, and not putting people in jail because of their thoughts, but putting people in jail because of their actions. These were depraved, disgusting actions.",4,1266.0,227.0,guest,126.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-08

147,WILLIAMS," You know, I think there's an added element that, you know, when you have people who are taking actions because of your race, religion, faith, ethnicity, immigrant status, whatever. And the whole idea behind hate crime legislation was that it would be additionally punitive. And I think these people should be punished to the absolute fullest extent of the law.

Happy New Year.  ",1,364.0,61.0,guest,10.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
14,"SEN. TOM COTTON, R-ARKANSAS","  Happy New Year, Shannon.  It's great to be on with you.  ",1,59.0,13.0,guest,11.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
15,BREAM,"  Let's start with the decision to take sanctions and actions against Russia, including expelling 35 operatives, closing two Russian intelligence compounds in Maryland and New York.  There are a number of sanctions on Russian intelligence organizations, companies supporting them, individuals as well.   Is it enough?  ",1,319.0,48.0,guest,12.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
16,COTTON,"  It's not enough, Shannon, and it's certainly too late.  Vladimir Putin is KGB.  He always has been.  He always will be.   President Obama has consistently looked the other way from Russia's provocations and aggressions.  The DNC hack last year was just one minor item in what Russia has done over the last eight years, to include things like invading and occupying Crimea and supporting rebels in eastern Ukraine, as well as threatening NATO airships -- or aircraft and ships and so forth.   But what has Barack Obama done for eight years?  In the very early years of his administration, just months after Russia had invaded Georgia, he sent Hillary Clinton to push the reset button with the Russian foreign minister.  In the middle of his re-election campaign in 2012, he told the Russian president that he would have more flexibility after the election.  When Mitt Romney characterized Russia as our number one geopolitical adversary, Barack Obama mocked him and said that the 1980s wanted their foreign policy back.   I’m glad the president has finally realized the threat that Russia poses to the United States and our interests but I wish he had recognized this eight years ago.  ",1,1187.0,202.0,guest,13.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
17,BREAM,"  Well, Russian President Vladimir Putin has responded.  Here's a bit of what he had to say.  ""As it proceeds of international practice, Russia has reasons to respond in kind.  Although we have the right to retaliate, we will not resort to irresponsible kitchen diplomacy but will plan our further steps to restore Russian/U.S. relations based on the policies of the Trump administration."" He went on to invite all diplomatic children who are in Russia to New Year's and Christmas parties at the Kremlin.   What does his response say to you?  ",1,543.0,93.0,guest,14.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
18,COTTON,"  Well, it's very heartwarming of President Putin.  I would recommend the kids not take their iPads to the Kremlin unless they want Russian services know what apps they’re playing every day for the rest of their lives.   Look, what Vladimir Putin needs is a sense of new boundaries.  He's had free rein throughout the world over the last eight years.  He needs to have a sense of boundaries and to know that costs are going to be imposed if he crosses those boundaries.   The administration has not drawn those boundaries and they have imposed a cost, and in fact, they have gone farther than just being weak on Russia action.  They have actively opposed measures to toughen up on Russia.  I proposed measures in our annual intelligence bill, for instance, that would enforce existing travel restrictions on Russian diplomats -- by which I mean Russian spies in the United States -- that would force the government to crack down on these Russian spies who are traveling all around America without the proper approvals.   I got a call just weeks ago from a senior administration official after the election, after the hacking, asking me to remove that from the bill because it would be too provocative.  So, it's not just that Russia has -- that the president and his administration has been weak on Russia, they have actively stopped other efforts by people like me and other Republicans and Democrats in Congress from trying to draw a firmer line.  ",1,1450.0,253.0,guest,15.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
19,BREAM,"  Well, my understanding is you went to the White House with a concept of something more formal, putting together a number of representatives from government agencies to fight back against Russian interference or coercion in our politics and what's going on here domestically.  My understanding of that is that you got a response basically from the administration saying it was duplicative of what was already in place, it wasn't necessary.   Can you tell us more about the response you got?",1,491.0,82.0,guest,16.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
20,COTTON,"  So, this is a second measure in the intelligence bill that the administration threatened to veto the bill over.   So, in the days of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union had something called ""active measures"".  They're influence operations.  They're propaganda.  They’re covert activities trying to undermine Western democracy.   I proposed to create an interagency panel in our government, like we’ve had in the days of the Soviet Union that would counteract these so-called ""active measures"".  The Obama administration assured us that this was duplicative and they didn't need it.  I would simply point out whatever they have in place right now must not be working given all that Russia has continued to do.  In fact, just yesterday, the administration acknowledged that Russia has continued to try to hack U.S. information systems, even after Barack Obama reportedly told Vladimir Putin to, quote, ""cut it out"".   So, whatever measures they have in place have not been working.  I wish they wouldn't have gone to such great lengths to undermine the efforts of Congress to take a tougher line on Russia the last eight years.  ",1,1128.0,187.0,guest,17.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
21,BREAM,"  Well, you mentioned a report that we got from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI together, pointing out what they says are credible links showing the tools and infrastructure that Russian civilian and military operators, intelligence operators were using to penetrate numerous systems here in the U.S.   Now, we got a response from president-elect Trump to that saying, ""It's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.  Nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation."" Is that enough for you?  Do you think he needs to take a harder line when presented with the hard evidence that was outlined in this report?  ",1,783.0,136.0,guest,18.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
22,COTTON,"  Well, again, the hack of the DNC last year, which the intelligence community said publicly was the result of Russian intelligence services or their affiliates is just one small example of Russia's nefarious activities over the last eight years.   Now, many Democrats and some of the media are trying to confuse that question, the action of the hacking, which Russian intelligence services or their affiliates undertook, with the impact on the election.  And unless Vladimir Putin hacked into Hillary Clinton's calendar and cancelled all of her rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin, or cancelled her speeches in which she was going to lay out an effective agenda for the working class, that didn't have an impact on this election.   It was Hillary Clinton's own decision to create a private email server that had a much bigger impact, along with her failure as a candidate.  So, it's time for Hillary Clinton to look in the mirror and the Democrats take stock of why they lost the election, rather than blaming it on Vladimir Putin or fake news or the Electoral College, or anything else.   Russia, though, will continue to be an adversary into the future and we continue to need to impose firmer lines on their behavior and to impose costs when they cross those lines.",1,1267.0,218.0,guest,19.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
23,BREAM,"  And to be clear, we always want to make the distinction.  No one is alleging that Russia broke into voter systems, changed votes, changed vote tallies -- not those kinds of things -- that would have a direct impact on votes as they were counted and tallied in deciding the presidency.   I want to ask you about Rex Tillerson, the Exxon CO who has been nominated to be secretary of state.  You've met with him.  He has been criticized by those who feel he has too friendly a relationship with Russia.   Are you convinced he can take a hard line?  How do you think he's going to, or not make it through the Senate?  ",1,616.0,118.0,guest,20.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
24,COTTON,"  Well, I had a good conversation with Rex Tillerson not just about Russia and Putin, but about many of the issues that we face around the world, as well as the challenges of managing the State Department.  I think it's a good thing when a secretary of state understands foreign leaders and understands the cultures and history of foreign peoples.  I think it will help him take a firm line in defense of U.S. interests as secretary of state, in the same way that he took a firm line in defense of the shareholders of ExxonMobil's interests with Vladimir Putin when he was the CEO of ExxonMobil.   That's what we need: hardnosed, clear eyed, unsentimental statesmanship that we haven't had the last eight years as President Obama and his administration have continued to look the other way and continued to conciliate and appease adversaries like Vladimir Putin.  ",1,864.0,150.0,guest,21.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
25,BREAM,"  Well, and this administration also took some bold steps in recent days with regard to Israel, that vote at the U.N.  They didn't veto it.  They didn’t block this measure that moved forward.   John Kerry, secretary of state, in defending that in a speech after the vote talked about the fact that no administration has been better to Israel.  He talked about a number of times that this administration has defended Israel.   You said this, though, about the U.N. vote, ""This cowardly disgraceful action cements President Obama's richly deserved legacy as the most anti-Israel president in American history."" Clearly, a disconnect between the two views on the way you see his legacy.",1,683.0,115.0,guest,22.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
26,COTTON,"  Well, I think the last week has been a fitting punctuation mark on eight years of Barack Obama's presidency.  First he abstained at the United Nations in the same way he abstained from leadership in the world for eight years.  And second, he was much harsher on his allies than his adversaries.   At root, the problem that we face in the Holy Land is not Israelites building new neighborhoods around Jerusalem.  It's the Palestinians refuse to acknowledge Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state in the Holy Land.  Until they do that, there won't be a peace agreement between the two peoples.  ",1,598.0,106.0,guest,23.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01

32,COTTON,"  No, I’m not privy to what Prime Minister Netanyahu is speaking about, but anyone with an ounce of common sense knows how the real world works and knows how the United Nations Security Council works.  Senegal and Malaysia, some of the countries that sponsor this resolution, don't call the shots there.  If Barack Obama and John Kerry and Samantha Power hadn't been speaking for months about the prospect of this resolution and had not been creating a climate inside the Security Council to let it come forward without firmly saying we will veto any one-sided anti-Israel resolution, no country would have brought that resolution forward.   It only could have been brought forward and passed with explicit United States coordination with other members of the Security Council.  ",1,779.0,129.0,guest,27.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
33,BREAM,"  Very quickly, we're just about out of time.  You wrote an op-ed in The New York Times about immigration, saying, President-elect Trump has a ""clear mandate to stop illegal immigration, but also to finally cut the influx of low skilled immigrants that undermines American workers.""

34,COTTON,"  Yes, absolutely.  Illegal immigration is a real problem.  That was a big issue in the campaign as well, to build a wall and to crack down on criminals and drug dealers who are here illegally.   But our immigration system for too long has brought in too many unskilled and low skilled workers which has undercut wages for working Americans.  We need an immigration system that focuses on the well-being and the needs of American citizens.   Whether they can trace their ancestry back to the Mayflower or whether they are brand new immigrants that just took the oath of citizenship, and our economy simply doesn’t need the levels of unskilled and low skill immigration that we have today when we're giving out a million green cards a year, a million more temporary visas every year, that undercuts American wages.  We need to focus on ultra high-skilled immigration that fits demonstrated economic need.  ",1,905.0,155.0,guest,29.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01

43,BREAM,"  Secretary of State John Kerry responding to Israeli criticism of the U.S. abstention from a vote condemning Israeli settlement construction, saying it was in the interest of preserving the two-state solution to which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed disappointment.   It is time now for our Sunday group.  Washington Examiner contributor, Lisa Boothe, Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky, Daniel Halper, The New York Post Washington bureau chief, and Charles Hurt, opinion editor for The Washington Times. All right.  We're going to get to Israel, but I want to start with Russia.   Lisa, we have this response from Putin saying, ""I could respond in kind.  I’m not going to.  We're going to wait and see what the Trump administration does.""",2,762.0,121.0,guest,35.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
44,"LISA BOOTHE, WASHINGTON EXAMINER CONTRIBUTOR","  Well, I think because he's waiting to see what the Trump administration does because essentially these sanctions are meaningless once President Obama leaves office.  I think what's really interesting here and I think part of the reason why we've seen Donald Trump react the way that he has is because this is clearly very politically motivated by President Obama.  Even The New York Times has tipped its hat to saying that they very much question the effect of these sanctions.   And I think it's very much being done to, one, delegitimize Donald Trump's victory and also to try to box him in on Russia as well and foreign policy as he comes into office.   And so -- I mean, you look at the fact that Russia had hacked the Joint Chiefs of Staff, unclassified email server, 4,000 military and civilian personnel.  Also the fact that China hacked 22 -- or compromised 22 million Americans' security information, as well as OPM, and what was the reaction from the president.  But somehow this was what elicited a response from President Obama.   So, I think Donald Trump is looking at this and thinking that it's very much political.  ",2,1134.0,200.0,guest,36.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
45,BREAM,"  Well, Daniel, does it create an issue for his nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, in that he's been very vocal against sanctions saying in many cases they don't work and obviously lobbying against them where they would affect Exxon's business interests where he is currently the CEO.  Now, he's going to have to answer more questions about that it seems going into a Senate confirmation hearing.  ",2,410.0,70.0,guest,37.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
46,"DANIEL HALPER, NEW YORK POST","  Certainly, I think you can expect Democrats on Capitol Hill to request all communications between him and his company and Russia for the last ten years or something extraordinary where you're going to try to get as much information out of him as possible.  This is going to be a real issue going forward.   I think it's not just that President Obama and President Trump are positioning, you can see in the response by Vladimir Putin and by Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, you're seeing world leaders really shift their attention.  They no longer take President Obama seriously.  They no longer -- I mean, with the Israel action, there are real responses, of course, with the U.N. vote but they're no longer so concerned about that.   You really see them shifting their attention toward President-elect Donald Trump and treating him as though he is the president.  And it's really altering foreign policy and really handcuffing President Obama at a time when he's trying to handcuff President-elect Trump.  ",2,1006.0,170.0,guest,38.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
47,BREAM,"  And to that point, we have a couple of tweets that went out from Donald Trump talking about Israel just days ago.  He said, ""We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect.  They used to have a friend in the U.S., but not anymore.  The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal and now this, U.N.!  Stay strong, Israel.  January 20th is fast approaching!""

48,"CHARLES HURT, THE WASHINGTON TIMES","  Yes, there's a new sheriff in town without doubt.  I thought your interview with Senator Cotton was very interesting.  He did a very good job of going through all of the transgressions that Russia -- that Vladimir Putin has committed against the United States the past eight years.   And, you know, the timing -- as you all said, the timing of this is very curious. The fact that, finally, the president has his dander up enough to do something about it and I think that the sanctions have very little to do with Vladimir Putin or Russia, and it has -- they have everything to do with Donald Trump and trying to set up something where, you know, when Donald Trump comes in, is he going to reverse this?   If he reverses this, how much political capital does he have to spend to do that?  How much does it hurt Rex Tillerson?  How much does that give Democrats sort of a political thing to use going forward against the Trump administration.  ",2,944.0,175.0,guest,40.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01

50,"JULIE ROGINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR","  Well, first of all, it is too little too late.  I will be the first to say, Tom -- and I say as a liberal, Tom Cotton was absolutely right in what he said this morning about how lax and how belated these actions are.   I also would say this is not so much the Democrats are driving this.  The two biggest forces on the Hill who are driving this are Senator McCain and Senator Graham, neither of whom is certainly a liberal or a Democrat.   It does box the president-elect in in the following way.  It seems to be a bipartisan consensus that you're going to have to do something much stronger than the Obama administration did to retaliate against the Putin regime.  And for the president-elect to say, ""Well, it’s time to move,"" as he did this week, and ""let's focus on other things,"" it's much harder to do when you have Republicans and Democrats, but specifically Republicans like Senate chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Graham, and other -- Senator Cotton certainly, all of whom believe that these sanctions don't go far enough and that you need to do something much stronger to punish Putin and his inner circle.   What does the president-elect do and potentially Secretary of State Tillerson do in response to that bipartisan pressure that's going to be put on him in January?  ",2,1302.0,235.0,guest,42.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
51,HURT,"  And I agree.  And I don't mean to in any way downplay the importance of this, exempt that I wish the president had done more much earlier.  But President-elect Trump did make a key part of this election about this effort to work with Vladimir Putin to combat terrorism.  I agree that the guy is not -- he's an unsavory character and I would like it if we didn't have to do anything with him. But that was part -- that was a major part of his campaign was to do that.  And if that's how he wants to focus that relationship, I don't know that that's -- it's been settled at least at the polls.  ",2,595.0,118.0,guest,43.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01

53,BREAM,  Sure.,2,7.0,2.0,guest,45.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
54,ROGINSKY,"  Because you have the president-elect coming in saying he wants to work with Vladimir Putin.  In 2000, George Bush came in and said, ""I looked in Vladimir Putin’s eyes, I saw his soul.""  You had Hillary Clinton with the reset.  He will learn very quickly, I hope, as his predecessors did on both sides of the aisle, that this is not a man we can work, that this is a man that will exploit every single weakness that he perceives the president to have in order to further his own agenda economically, domestically and internationally.   And as a result, the faster the president-elect understands that this is not somebody you can work with to stem terrorism when he, in fact, is fomenting terrorism in places like Syria by working with Iran overseas, the faster that happens, the faster the president-elect can get on with actually punishing Putin from what he does --",2,869.0,154.0,guest,46.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
55,BREAM,"  I want to make sure that we touch on Israel as well, and what happened at the U.N.  From Facebook, we have Hal Widsten who said, ""What possibly did the Obama administration believe they could accomplish by taking this action less than a month before the newly elected president takes over?""  Lisa?  ",2,301.0,54.0,guest,47.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
56,BOOTHE,"  Well, I mean, he's changing U.S./Israeli policy essentially.  That's what's happened from this U.N. resolution.  It's going to be very difficult for the United States to try to reverse it.  So, I think President Obama is trying to leave a lasting legacy regarding foreign policy by the abstention from that vote.   But I think what's deeply disturbing is Secretary Kerry had said during his speech that the abstention is representative of U.S. values.  I think that really underscores sort of a distorted viewpoint of the Obama administration and their foreign policy throughout President Obama's presidency in the sense that even Steny Hoyer has said that the resolution tips the hand of the Palestinians.   So, we are essentially tipping the hand of -- you look at the Palestinian Authority and 10 percent of the budget goes towards supporting and paying terrorists and their families.  The same to be said of the Iran deal, lifting sanctions for Iran, helping Iran rebuild their economy.  Again, the largest state sponsor of terrorism.   So, I think -- and the Hamas spokesperson who is saying that they appreciate the resolution, who's praising the resolution, so I think it is deeply disturbing that President Obama and this administration thinks that is representative of American values when we have repeatedly propped up and helped these countries that support terrorism around the country, but yet we turn our back on Israel.  We turn our back on our friend.   And as Benjamin Netanyahu said, this was an ambush attack and he called it a declaration of war.  I find that very deeply disturbing that somehow the administration thinks this is representative of American values because it is not.  ",2,1706.0,284.0,guest,48.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01

70,LEO,"  Well, first of all, I think the president made very clear throughout the campaign that he was looking for justices who were going to interpret the Constitution as the framers meant it to be.  And so, that I think first and foremost is what he's looking for in a justice on the Supreme Court.   I think he's also looking for someone who's going to be extremely capable and bright.  He said at one point during the third debate he wanted someone who was going to be widely respected by the legal and judicial communities and by the public at large.  He wants someone who has a deep record of commitment to the Constitution.   And those are all of the different factors that are being considered right now as the president and the transition culture the list of 21 people who he announced as prospects for the Supreme Court during the campaign.",4,843.0,154.0,guest,58.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01

Continuing, ""despite that, at least a half-dozen of the candidates on the list lack a pro-life record.

And we appreciate that because the president is working very hard to get this right. And these are people who have very deep records that have to be analyzed very carefully. And lots of cases have to be read. And there's no one particular statement or comment by any of these prospective nominees that can be viewed in isolation.

73,BREAM," All right, I want to talk through some of the names that keep bubbling to the top. Judge Bill Pryor serves on the 11th Circuit. He's called Roe v. Wade the worst abomination in the history of constitutional law, but there are conservatives who say they're worried about something else, a 2011 decision seen as a landmark expansion of transgender rights. ""Slate"" described it this way. ""He supported an absolutely revolutionary opinion in 2011 holding that anti-trans discrimination qualifies as sex discrimination and is thus generally forbidden under the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. Pryor didn't write the decision, but he did join in it in full, suggesting he endorsed its logic and conclusion."" You know that's an issue the Supreme Court is going to tackle very soon, even is going to touch on in a big case later in 2017.",4,848.0,144.0,guest,61.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
74,LEO," Well, first of all, Shannon, as you know, Bill Pryor is a U.S. Court of Appeals judge who sits down in Alabama. He's been on the bench a long time. He has a very distinguished record of public service, having served as the attorney general of Alabama before serving on the federal bench for over a decade. Bill Pryor has a very deep bench of judicial opinions. And the transvestite case you referenced is one of his opinions where he was bound by precedence of the U.S. Supreme Court, in particular a Pricewaterhouse case that involves gender stereotyping kinds of discrimination. And really that case is about applying Supreme Court precedent as faithfully as one can, which is what a court of appeals judge often has to do. They're bound by what the Supreme Court says. They have to apply those precedents to existing facts that come before them in particular cases. So I think that explains Judge Pryor's ruling more than anything else.",4,940.0,165.0,guest,62.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
75,BREAM," I want to make sure that we touch on Judge Thomas Hardiman as well. Another federal appeals court judge. He is on the younger side, which, of course, a lot of people think is a benefit when you’re putting someone on a lifetime appointment on the bench. I’ve got to tell you, chatter around him is that he's a favorite of a lot of people out there. Why’s he on the list?",4,370.0,73.0,guest,63.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
76,LEO," Well, first of all, he also has a very distinguished record of judicial service. He has the distinction of actually having served both as an appeals court judge and as a trial court judge in the federal district court, which is very valuable in the sense that we don't have many justices on the U.S. Supreme Court who understand how trial courts work. So that's, I think, very important. He's a person of tremendous distinction, having attended Notre Dame University and Georgetown Law School. He -- he has an interesting personal story in the sense that he drove a taxicab to support his way through law school. So he has a lot of those personal qualities, as well as important intellectual qualities that I think make him a serious prospect for the U.S. Supreme Court among others on the list.",4,796.0,141.0,guest,64.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
77,BREAM," And for those who are pushing Mr. Trump to consider appointing a woman to the bench, Judge Diane Sykes, a federal appeals court judge as well. A Bush 43 appointee. She's voted to uphold voter I.D. laws and in favor of gun rights. But she’s got a couple of decisions that worry conservatives as well. She joined a decision forbidding the use of a church for a graduation ceremony. In a Planned Parenthood case, she ruled in favor of the organization and against an Indiana law that attempted to cut off funding to Planned Parenthood. She's been criticized for a ruling against those pro-life ""Choose Life"" license plates. What's the case for her?",4,646.0,114.0,guest,65.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
78,LEO," Well, first of all, Judge Sykes has a long, deep record of judicial service. She not only serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals there based in Chicago, but she was also a justice on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. So she's got a very, very long, deep record of service on the bench. She calls herself a textualist and an originalist, someone who interprets the Constitution according to its words and original meaning. And sometimes you have to take the law wherever it brings you. And in the case of some of these decisions that she's issued, she's interpreting statutes, she's interpreting the Constitution in light of Supreme Court precedent that she's bound by. And so you can't always just look at the results. You have to look at the methodology that a judge uses in reaching a particular decision. And she grounds herself in text and in the original meaning of the Constitution. And those are the kinds of things that the president was hoping to have in a justice when he talks about a justice who is going to interpret the Constitution and the laws as it was meant to be.",4,1075.0,194.0,guest,66.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01

80,LEO," Well, that's up to the president, of course. And, as you know, the chief of staff and others have indicated that they want to move as quickly as possible. Perhaps having someone nominated around the time of the inauguration. The important thing to bear in mind is that we have one final sitting of the U.S. Supreme Court at the end of April. So, ideally, you would have someone who could be seated on the court at least by then to hear those final round of cases, perhaps even have some of the 4-4 decisions, if there are any, reheard by the court. And so you had a 50-day period for one of the most liberal justices on the court. Ruth Bader Ginsburg. So hopefully we can have a nomination relatively soon and then a process of about 50 or so days within which to get someone confirmed.",4,787.0,149.0,guest,68.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01

90,"AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER OBAMA ECONOMIC ADVISOR", Thank you.,5,11.0,3.0,guest,75.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
91,BREAM," All right, Austan, I'll start with you. Do you give the president-elect any credit for these jobs he talked about this week or for weeks ago the deal with Carrier?",5,164.0,31.0,guest,76.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
92,GOOLSBEE," Well, look, I'm -- I’m happy that the jobs are going to come back. I'm a little nervous that the fact that Donald Trump is currently re-announcing jobs that he already counted. So when -- when SoftBank said they were going to move jobs and expand them in the United States, these were the jobs they were talking about. So he's -- he’s like a student trying to (INAUDIBLE) -- change the goal posts and just quote it as a different number.",5,438.0,83.0,guest,77.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
93,BREAM," But if he had something to do with -- with the first announcement -- but if he had something to do with the initial announcement, either way, does he get any credit for whether it was announced weeks ago or for now?",5,216.0,43.0,guest,78.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
94,GOOLSBEE," I mean -- I would give him some credit for it. You know, I would point out that under Barack Obama, in the last seven years, we've added 15 million private sector jobs. So I think they're going to need to speed up the job creation if they want to match what has happened under Barack Obama. But I give President-elect Trump some credit for that.",5,346.0,67.0,guest,79.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
95,BREAM," All right, Steve, to that point, you know that the United Steel Workers, one of the union leaders there at Carrier, got into it with Mr. Trump saying he wasn't telling the truth about how many jobs were being saved. He told ""The Washington Post"" something I can't say on the air, but, quote, ""he lied his blank off."" Is this the kind of thing a president can be doing, though, going around making these individual deals, getting into Twitter fights with union officials? I mean how’s this going to work?",5,504.0,92.0,guest,80.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
96,MOORE," Well, I think the idea, during this period between the election and his inauguration of -- of going to companies and saying, look, don't leave the country now, good things are coming. We're going to change the tax laws in a very pro-business way. We're going to get a lot of these onerous regulations that are strangling businesses off of your back. We're going to fix Obamacare and all -- and -- and basically I think he's sending a message, a, to businesses saying, you know, stay here, this is a good time to invest in the United States, and, b, I think he's sending a message to those voters in those Midwestern states, Shannon, like Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Indiana, saying, I've got your back. For the first time, you know, I -- you know, it was President Obama who said, you can't just wave a wand and have these jobs come back. But I don't know if it's a magic wand, but so far he's actually persuaded a number of major companies to invest in the United States. And I think it's the start of something real big.",5,1036.0,191.0,guest,81.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01

98,MOORE, Yes.,5,5.0,2.0,guest,83.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
99,BREAM," And both sides of the aisle, people hoping that there will be some changes. Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, says that tax reform is something that happens within the first 90 days of this presidency. Let's touch up -- on a couple of points that we've heard from the president-elect so far with regard to individuals reducing the number of tax rates, dropping the top from 39.6 to 33, eliminating personal exemptions and for businesses reducing the top corporate rate from 35 down to 15 percent and restructuring taxes on pass-through businesses as well. Austan, is there anything that you hear in the tax plan that works for you?",5,645.0,111.0,guest,84.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
100,GOOLSBEE," Well, not really. And it’s -- it’s not about me. I mean people should just go look at it themselves. Donald Trump ran a campaign that was largely policy-free and the -- the broad outlines of what he's about to do are not understood by the American people. And they're in for a rude awakening. We're going to massively cut corporate taxes by trillions and it's going to be paid for by a value-added based national sales tax. I don't think anyone that voted for Donald Trump understood that's what he was planning to do. I'm not sure Donald Trump understood that's what he was planning to do. And if they now propose it, I'm going to be very interested to see how people react to that.",5,684.0,128.0,guest,85.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
101,BREAM," Well, Steve, you were advising him along the way. Did he understand -- what did he understand of this plan?",5,108.0,21.0,guest,86.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
102,MOORE," Well, look, I helped Donald Trump with Larry Kudlow and Steve Mnuchin put the plan together. I disagree with Austan. I think we were very, very specific about what that plan is, what we intended to do on the business taxes, what we intended to do to simplify the tax system. The heart of the plan, Shannon, is that business tax cut. We have the highest business tax rate in the world. I think even Austan and I may -- may agree on this, that, you know, it just doesn't work anymore for the United States to be competing against China, India, Germany, Mexico, all of these countries, and we're putting all of our companies at a -- at a disadvantage with respect to our taxes here. It’s like a -- I described our corporate income tax as a head-start program for every country that we compete with. So we're going to go from being the highest tax rate country in the world to the lowest. And if you do that, I think it's going to be a magnet for businesses and companies and capital to move back to the United States. Tax rates do matter. The rest of the world’s been cutting them. We haven't. I think it's going to make -- make a significant change in terms of employment in this country. You can't have good jobs without healthy businesses.",5,1240.0,233.0,guest,87.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
103,BREAM," Austan, could we negotiate a little bit of a Kumbaya moment? Is there some of that you agree with?",5,99.0,20.0,guest,88.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
104,GOOLSBEE," Well, look, there is some of that I agree with, but if you believe those are magic beanstalk beans, then I think, a, look around the world and say, well, who has the lowest corporate tax rate in the world? They must be doing great. It's Uzbekistan.",5,249.0,48.0,guest,89.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
105,MOORE, Wow.,5,5.0,2.0,guest,90.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
106,GOOLSBEE, So I don't think that just cutting corporate tax rates alone --,5,64.0,13.0,guest,91.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
107,MOORE, That’s true.,5,13.0,3.0,guest,92.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
108,GOOLSBEE," Especially if you don't pay for them or you try to pay for them with a national sales tax, makes any sense. And I think if you look at what the Trump administration is proposing, it's going to blow up the deficit in the United States. And it was promised to give us massive growth and massive job creation by George Bush when he did almost identical procedures as what Donald Trump is proposing. And it didn't work. The very same people who said it was going to work in 2001 are saying it now.",5,494.0,96.0,guest,93.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01

120,MOORE," I believe that this economy is very fragile. I think that this has been an incredibly weak recovery and that's just not my opinion, every economist agrees that it's been a very flimsy recovery. We've borrowed $10 trillion over the last ten years. What we've done in the last decade just hasn't worked in my opinion. We do need a new approach. Now, the tax rate reductions we're talking about are very consistent with what John F. Kennedy did in the 1960s, with what Ronald Reagan did in the 1980s. Those were two big boom periods in the United States. I think we can do it again. It's not just taxes, though. We do want to get the regulations off of businesses. We do want to fix Obamacare so you can reduce health care costs. We do want to have a pro-America energy policy. And I believe if we do all those things, Shannon, we can go from 2 percent growth under Obama to 4 percent growth under -- under Trump.",5,911.0,172.0,guest,105.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01

133,BREAM," President Barack Obama, in an interview with David Axelrod, a friend and former advisor, this week expressing confidence he could have defeated Donald Trump in a hypothetical third race for a third term. We're now back with the panel. Charles, what do you make of that?",6,270.0,47.0,guest,115.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
134,HURT," Well, you know, it's another example of the president saying basically the problem here was that the American people weren't listening enough to me because, of course, he did campaign. He campaigned very hard and it was a referendum on him. And it -- they -- it was a rejection of not only -- I mean a rejection not -- you know, not only of Hillary Clinton, but of eight years of President Obama’s policies. He’s -- you know, he will always go down as a successful president in his mind because he won re-election and that was great. But it was at a -- at a grievous cost to -- to his party and I think the -- you know, the things that he was -- that he was pushing.",6,667.0,132.0,guest,116.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
135,BREAM," Well, the vice president, in an interview with The L.A. Times, had some interesting, you know, thoughts on exactly what happens with the Democratic Party, where they may have missed it on this. He said, quote, ""I believe that we were not letting an awful lot of people -- high school educated, mostly Caucasian, but also people of color -- know that we understood their problems."" And he also talked about, quote, ""a bit of elitism that's crept in"" to party thinking, Daniel.",6,476.0,84.0,guest,117.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
136,HALPER," Yes, he also, in that same interview, talked about how equality doesn't actually feed people. So I think he really gets at the heart of the Democratic problem. And what Barack Obama has never -- he’s never lacked confidence in his own abilities, obviously, and that's helped him tremendously in a certain way put himself forward. But the recognition of what came -- what he -- what happened to his own party, what limitations their agenda and how far left they went and how it prevented Americans from actually -- from their policies addressing Americans' needs, I think really needs to, in their comeback, and there will be a comeback on the Democratic side, they really need to recognize those shortcomings and provide and offer a solution to the American people.",6,766.0,132.0,guest,118.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
137,BREAM," Well, and a lot of folks look at the lobbying and jockeying for the head of the DNC, Julie, and they look at some of the people who have been in that mix, Representative Keith Ellison, Secretary Tom Perez, and say those are not the most moderate people in the party. Does the party not get that maybe average Americans don't want the far left progressive agenda, as, you know, Daniel referenced, they want to feed their families?",6,430.0,79.0,guest,119.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
138,ROGINSKY," You know, to me, the chairmanship of the DNC is only important in that it has to be somebody that understands the mechanics of how to campaign and get out the vote. What the ideology of the DNC chairman is to me is largely irrelevant in the face of that. What is relevant to me is the message that Democrats are putting out to the extent that the vice president talked about, that Democrats, for lack of a better description, feel the pain of the people out there. And I took some onus on myself as well after the election. It is very easy for me, sitting in New York or Washington, to go and say, well, look, so many more people have health care thanks to ObamaCare, not understanding that many of those people are also paying a lot more money out of pocket for that health care. Very easy to say millions of jobs have been created, despite the fact that people are saying, these are not the kinds of jobs that we want. And so there was a failure of communication and I think -- and -- and to some extent he is right, some elitism when it comes to being condescending in trying to tell people that their life is great when they personally did not think their life was great. And I think I took responsibility for that right after the election. I think more Democrats need to look in the mirror and do the same. Going forward, that's what the party needs to communicate. There are people in places like West Virginia or Kentucky who are about to lose a tremendous amount of health care if they repeal ObamaCare, and those are the people that voted for Donald Trump. The Democratic Party needs to explain to them why those policies are harmful to their own interests. That’s what needs to happen. We can't keep talking in the mirror about how great things are when for a lot of people they’re not that great.",6,1808.0,340.0,guest,120.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01

144,BOOTHE," Yes, you know, we’ll see. I mean there's ten -- at least ten senators that are running for re-election in states that Donald Trump won, five states in which he won by double digits. But what's interesting, if you remember, Senator Chuck Schumer, before the 2016 election, had alluded to the fact that ObamaCare was a mistake because they should have focused on middle class voters and policies that embittered their life. And so, if you remember, before 2016, he had made that comment that that was a mistake. But to President Obama's point, I think his comment really came from a place of insecurity because for a guy who's been so focused on his legacy and someone who has done the most of his legacy by executive fiat, whether it's the Paris climate deal, or the Iran deal, a lot of it’s going to be eradicated. And -- and so the great irony here is the fact that we have a president who's been so focused on his legacy and done so much in the name of legacy, whether it's Guantanamo Bay, whether it's the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, much of what he's done is just simply going to go away because he lost the election. And the only lasting legacy that he really has, ObamaCare, was done on a strictly partisan basis, which we've never seen before with a major entitlement, whether it's Medicare, Social Security, even Medicare Part D. You know, and so I found that to be really interesting from his comments. But, you know, I do think that the Democratic Party needs to refocus its message more -- more largely speaking.",6,1528.0,278.0,guest,124.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
145,BREAM," Well, and, Daniel, to the point of that so much of this was done through executive action and fiats and those kind of things that can be undone, it's a much tougher business to get up there and legislate, make the sausage on The Hill. Will a President Trump be different in that respect?",6,288.0,55.0,guest,125.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
146,HALPER," Well, that’s the question, right, Republicans have gotten very good at being in opposition and they were very good at sniping. Can they actually govern? And when they repeal ObamaCare, which I think they will, as they promised to do, they then take responsibility for the entire health care system, much in the same way that President Obama did when he implemented ObamaCare. So it's going to have the reverse effect with people losing their health -- current healthcare plans. Huge upheaval in a massive sector of the economy and it really creates a huge problem that's looming right ahead for Republicans.",6,608.0,103.0,guest,126.0,0,Fox News,Fox News Sunday,2017-01-01
